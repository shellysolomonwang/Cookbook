1,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,5,Best introductory book on incorporating herbs into our daily lives,Format: Kindle Edition,"Wow! That was the first thing that came out of my mouth as I began reading this book. It is by far the best introductory book I have seen in my almost three decades of learning about herbal medicine and herbal support. I was hesitant to buy another introductory herb book as my knowledge is beyond the introductory level. But the recipes in this book are worth every penny.

I wish I had this book to start with back then. I think it would have saved me money, time and energy as I explored what I thought was herbal medicine content. The content is not overwhelming and if this is the only herb book you learn from you will have a basic foundation if using herbs for nutritional support and basic home remedies. The foundational content includes an explanation about how herbs serve individuals unlike our current system of One Solution Syndrome for everyone (take a pill for this and then take a pill for that), a well-explained overview of the energetics of herbs and deep dive into the tastes of herbs - which is my favorite part.

More than anything else, I love the simplicity of introducing herbs through food and cooking. Food should always be our first medicine - which is how I can easily justify a Cardamon Chocolate Mousse Cake each month since it so good for me! Another aspect I like about the recipes is that they are all very doable: no specialized equipment, no huge orders of exotic herbs and spices and no tricky culinary skills required. The author has done a remarkable job of making herbal support both legitimate to the doubtful and accessible to the open-minded.

Most importantly, Rosalee uses her clinical skills throughout her writing and offers recent research to support medicinal applications. She also employs safety and caution and gives specific examples of what some herbs can do (because yes, they really work!) to some individuals.

Overall, I think this is the best introductory book on incorporating herbs and their nutritional and medicinal properties to support our health.",338 people found this helpful,1
2,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,5,"Finally, a Guide for actually USING Herbs beyond just Tisanes",Format: Paperback,"I'm not sure what I was expecting (maybe the stereotypical herb book) but Rosalee has covered SO much more than I imagined would be in there! I've only skimmed through so far but want to say I love all the photos, powerfully useful information and the easy to read tone and type font. And of course that ""new book smell"" Just knowing some Herbs and ID'ing them is one thing, but learning ways to actually USE them (aside from plain old tisanes, tinctures and salves) is a real treasure! This will make a great gift for my sisters who are learning about Herbs, too, and my daughter so she can prepare even healthier and more fun meals. My grandkids are excited to forage with me this season. What better way to get them excited about nature, nutrition, their meals, survival basics - and keeping their noses out of electronic devices as they get older - than hands on ""doing"". ? We need more practical application guides like this.",140 people found this helpful,1
3,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,5,My New Favorite Herb Book!,Format: Paperback,"I was not going to get this book at first because I have so many herb books already. But I love John and Kimberly of Learnng Herbs and I have used several of Rosalee's remedies and recipes already so I wanted to support the great work they are doing! Omg! I love this book! It is informative, beautiful, practical and jam packed with amazing things to make and eat! Last weekend I was out in the yard picking dandelion leaves, my husband asked why I was weeding the yard and I told him I was going to make Dandelion Pesto! It was the best pesto I've ever had in my life. Cinnamon Maple Chia Seed Pudding for dessert was so yummy and healthy! Treated the girls at work today with Spiced Carrot Cake and they went crazy over it! I have worked with herbs for almost 20 years, yet I am learning new and wonderful things from Alchemy of Herbs!

6,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,5,TL;DR - 6 stars on every important point!,Format: Paperback,"This book is amazing!
Although, If you're looking for a ""this herb heals this issue"" sort of book, this isn't for you. If you want to know how to use herbs in just about any other way though, this book IS for you!

My favorite parts are (in no particular order):
1- the full color pictures of the herbs so I can take it out with me to try to identify wild plants,
2- the glossary at the back! I'm learning but not all of the vocab has stuck yet
3- the actual studies about the herbs! until Rosalee talked about it a little while ago I bought into the ""herbs-aren't-studied"" rumor but now I have sourced studies that I can kindly share with the mis-informed. We shall end this rumor!
4- It's not as tall as I was expecting. At first, it kind of made me sad but I realized quickly that it will fit in my diaperbag better so I can carry it with me everywhere without cutting back on diaperbag necessities.
5- There are a list of places at the back of the book that provide herbs and supplies along with info on if they provide the herbs and/ or the supplies and if there are other things you should know (one of the places provides fresh herbs but you have to order those in advance).
6- Instead of a text book or recipe book, it's feels almost like a story. It's all personalized with stories and emotion so it's like reading a letter from a friend, exactly what a great book should do.
7- While not every recipe has a picture of it, a huge majority of them do (including a couple very tempting desserts) and the ones that don't seem to be things like the teas that all look fairly similar anyways.
8- ""Part 1"" where she goes into the taste of herbs and the importance of energetics. I've learned these from her but I'm very happy they're in the book as both a reminder and also to make it easier for me to help and teach others.
9- They aren't all food recipes! There are other things too like ""Lavender bath salts"", ""Cayenne salve"", and ""Cinnamon tooth powder""
10- The cute picture of the ladybug on the sage leaf on page 158.
11- She lists the special considerations of the herbs. Things like ""use in low doses (or avoid) if pregnant"", ""avoid if you're on blood thinners"", and other sorts of things that one needs to consider.
12- The metric conversion chart!

On the other side, there were a couple things I didn't like
1- The corner of the cover was slightly bent up when I opened the box. Most likely Amazon's fault since the box was quite a bit bigger than it needed to be and the packaging only slightly prevented the book from moving around.
2- Several of the pages were cut slightly off. They're the same size as the book but the bottom line of a couple of the ""who-said-the-quote""s got sliced in half. I can still read it but there is a small strip of white at the top.

Because the first issue isn't their fault and the second one has nothing to do with the quality of information or how it is presented, I'm still going to wish I could give it more stars or something along those lines. And I'm honestly considering buying another for a wedding present for a friend and possibly a few for presents this Christmas.",29 people found this helpful,1
7,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,5,Inspiring and lovely,Format: Paperback,"Super Love this book!!!! There are several things I am enjoying about it.
Firstly, it has gorgeous pictures! For a visual learner, this is so lovely. Secondly, there are just the right amount of practical uses & recipe suggestions for each herb. Lastly, and most importantly to me, Rosealee has a warm, wonderful, & relaxed way of relating the information to you, the reader. I fell in love with the book when I read about the herb, rosemary, & her account of her visit to southern France. She recalls hiking down a dusty trail that lead her to beautiful view of the Mediterranean, where she found at her feet a large patch of fragrant and flourishing rosemary. She was inspired by her experience in that moment, recalling that rosemary means, ""dew of the sea. "" Reading her personal experience with the herbs not only makes me want to learn more about the herbs themselves, but keeps me grounded, remembering that we learn about herbs as they relate to people. Its inspiring to me. It's not just about botanical science, & the alchemy of herbs. The science alone is intensely interesting to me, but the relational aspect of helping other humans is what makes learning it all truly worth it to me.
A truly love work, Rosealee. A job well done. Thank you.",29 people found this helpful,1

I can't understate how much of a win-win this book is for everyone interested in becoming knowledgeable about herbs. Whether your ultimate goal is to build a pantry-size apothecary or brew a nourishing cup of tea using , this book is written for you.

Although I consider myself fairly well-versed in the herb department, I like that this book is written for people who are not...in an easy read manner with plenty of tools, such as quizzes, exercises, and recipes to help you navigate down the herbal highway:

* what types of herbs to use for your personal constitution (whether you are hot, cold, damp, or dry);
* how herbs can help ""tune"" up your system and keep it running smoothly; and
* how best to use those herbs (steeped in tea, blended into a lotion, added to pesto sauce, baked in a cake).",13 people found this helpful,1
9,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,5,Wonderful and Incredibly Helpful,Format: Paperback,"This book exceeded my expectations. I read it in 2 days because the style is simple but rich with description and I have to add, very easy to understand. I finally had to get my sticky notes to mark the pages I wanted to go back to because after the 20th page of thinking “I’d like to try this...” or “this is fascinating, I’ll come back to this page,” I lost track.

It’s packed with origin, usage, dosages, how to’s, vibrant pictures, and resources. The first chapter broke down every single question I ever had about “I wonder why “this” isn’t working for me.” I understand now that my physical balance determines what I need rather than searching for supplement to fix all. If your looking for an all around easy to read approach to begin a healthy lifestyle, this is a great book.",6 people found this helpful,1
10,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,5,Accessible and powerful info,Format: Paperback,"My first thought was - why do I need another herb book? I've got the coffee table one that has pretty pictures, I've got the one by the lady who lives in the woods and tells the medicinal values...Well, I'll tell you why.
This book makes herbs completely accessible. It illuminates the cozy, comforting and yet powerful and continuous connection between our nourishment and our healing, between our food and our medicine.
Rosalee helps us realize that healing and supporting health doesn't have to be something that is difficult, dangerous, and done only in special places by intensely educated people. It can start at home with adding some garlic and turmeric to your soup, and dandelion greens to your salad (and hundreds of other delicious and healthy ways!)
It is an inclusive book that doesn't bash anyone, but like nourishing herbs, simply serves to bolster the good and illuminate connections.
I appreciate this addition to my kitchen AND medicine shelf.
Thank you! (I've also given several as gifts to very appreciate friends :) )",17 people found this helpful,1

37,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,5,Well Organized and Informative,Format: Paperback,"This book is very well organized for anyone new to herbology. I particularly liked her focus on the individualized approach to medicine, incorporating the many solution approach, integrating herbology with all aspects of medicine. Diagnosing the individual rather than the disease makes each remedy individualized. Our thoughts, feelings and environment may result in dis-ease and the western approach of soothing the symptoms actually makes discovering the root cause that much harder.

Gave some to my parents and t hey couldn't even tell it was grain free and LOVED it too and carrot cake is one of my father's favorites. The ONLY reason I gave this book 4 stars was NOT due to the author or the contents but rather the publisher/printer...I had this book less than 24hrs and the cover was coming off already, revealing just a slightly sticky gel strip holding it on, as it's supposed to have a lay-flat binding. I would've ordered another but looking at this, pretty sure it would have the same issue. Instead, I am taking it to Staples or Office Depot and having it spiral bound.

394,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,5,"A great recipe book on ""how to nourish and heal the body with medicinal herbs"" and much more...",Format: Paperback,"I am always exited to buy new books on herbal medicines. Learning medical herbs is about getting to know how to use plants to best serve one's goals, whether it is to nourish or to tonify ones body. I have a lot of respect for authors who are able to provide clear and simple guidances to assist in a learning process, and bring enthusiasm and passion into that learning. I believe Rosalee De La Forêt is meant to be that enthusiastic and passionate teacher.
Alchemy of Herbs is not a compilation of symptoms relieving remedies. It is a wise selection of herbs (that might have been challenging to do), with practical advises and relevant recipes that help the reader to incorporate each of those herbs into one's daily use for one's health and wellbeing.
Rosalee De La Forêt starts with a brief explanation on energetics and how to match an herb with a person, to find out what herb is the most appropriate for one's condition. Then she develops a chapter for each of the 28 herbs she selected, regrouped according to their taste. She describes in each chapter the property of the herb, how to use it and then she goes on offering great, easy to follow recipes for each.
For the novice that I am or even the expert in herbal medicine, this book helps bring together medicinal plants and people in the most relevant setting: our kitchen!
Some will always notice that only 28 herbs are fully covered, so i see here an opportunity to call for a second, a third...or a fourth volume. 28 at a time, makes it easier to learn than an overwhelming 112. Some will complain that they did not find in here the remedy for their particular health issues, and they will miss the point of people and plants energetics.
This book will acquaint the reader with medical herbs and will give them great ideas on how to use them, like it did to me.",One person found this helpful,1

Instead I laid in bed with heart palpitations and excessive sweating! Just because it's natural, doesn't mean it'll go well with your body. That's the main point of this book.

The last, because it goes way beyond the usual clinical recipes usually presented, including beauty, relax, food and drink, even spirituality. I think it is a very good way to present the materia medica, avoiding the usual role of such works (staying in the bookcase and being read only when something goes wrong) and causing the herbs to invade our lives de facto - which is what the authoress wants, of course.

The pages are tinted and the text is an anemic sans-serif font, which is all very artistic but not conducive to reading. I gave my copy away.",10 people found this helpful,0
1463,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,2,It Stinks,Format: Paperback,Beautiful book that I would like to read but the ink smell /paper it is printed on is soo strong I can only handle a few pages before I have to put it down.,6 people found this helpful,0
1464,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,2,Nothing close to what I'd expected from a well known name in the herbalist world.,Format: Paperback,"There was a lot of hype online leading up to this book's release, and sadly I bought into it. The book is pretty, with lots of full color photos that are very well done. But there really aren't all that many different herbs included, and the information about each one is quite limited for a book of this size. It would be really wonderful if Rosalee focused more on content and less on tons of photos and massive marketing ploys. I don't buy books because they are pretty; I buy them for the information they contain. Yes, it's nice having lots of photos, etc., but it surely doesn't make up for such limited content. Nothing close to what I'd expected from a well known name in the herbalist world.",13 people found this helpful,0
1465,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,3,Not enough herbs,Format: Paperback,The book only covers about 30 herbs but does have some nice recipes. I was hoping for a more comprehensive amount and not the typical types. Too much narrative and not enough substance. Nice pictures.,7 people found this helpful,0
1466,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,3,Practical but not the whole story.,Format: Paperback,"This book is a good introduction to cooking with herbs and spices. The pictures are very nice and it's organized like a cookbook. The writing is very personal and blogger style. The title is a bit misleading to those who want a lot more detail on the plant itself and its history. I may resent the adaptation of herbalism and spirituality into ""modern western"" medicine, but this book is practical and I can't take points for that. Hopefully it will reach the masses who aren't hip to ways of the graves on which we stand. I liked the sections on garlic and ginger, they were thoughtfully written and shows a good amount of research was made accessible to readers. The part about matching the herb to the person and the herbal sweet spot is a good topic to include, very important, however it's a topic subject to a lot of debate so it could have used a bit more air time. All said and done, I learned from this book. I think it appeals more to someone looking for treatment, which is a perfect reason to hold onto it. This book may not be for everyone but it's for a lot of people.",2 people found this helpful,0
1467,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,3,The book is ok. I was expecting more.,Format: Paperback,"The book is ok, I think I was expecting more recipes and ideas to make it easier to add to everyday meals. I can find everything in this book in other books. But if I were to suggest books for new herbalists, I would suggest anything by Rosemary Gladstar. Her books are easy to understand and lots of recipes and methods to get started even if you are new or not, to herbalism.",12 people found this helpful,0
1468,Alchemy of Herbs: Transform Everyday Ingredients into Foods and Remedies That Heal,3,Book Looks and Feels Used,Format: Paperback,"This book arrived with cover corner folds. The spine also has a crease across the bottom and onto the back.
Also has a small smudge of grease (?) on the back. Looks and feels used.
Am returning for a replacement and will update my review based on the book contents at that time.",One person found this helpful,0
