1,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,5,Love the concept,Format: Hardcover,Love all Jessica's books. I don't always agree with some of her nutritional components but I just over look that and add my knowledge to what ever I am doing. No biggie. The spiral binding is great. Tip: I look for baby food on sale and purchased in bulk so I can just grab and cook! My copy was used and just like new. Arrived on time and no damage,13 people found this helpful,1
2,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,5,Its a PUREE REVOLUTION-- and I've made every recipe in the book!,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"This little book has revolutionized the way we eat in our home. I am so thankful that I found it.

First of all, lots of reviewers are very passionate about the whole philsophy of how we feed children. There are many who feel strongly that ""hiding"" vegetables isn't a good idea and that children should eat vegetables ""as they are."" I respect that opinion-- but that is NOT a fair review of this book. That is a separate philosophical issue that you should resolve in your own home and for your own family.

Deceptively Delicious states openly, on the front cover in fact, that its purpose is to get children to eat good food. That's it. So, to review this book, I think its fair to focus on how well it meets its stated goal. In other words, I'm going to review the specific recipies and the strategies:

RECIPES:
I have made every single recipe in this book. They are mostly ""YUMMY!"" with a couple that are just okay. The standouts, by far, are: spagetti with meatballs, chicken nuggets, soup, macaroni and cheese, chocolate pudding, burgers, and grilled cheese.

THE STRAGETIES:
I am a mother who works full time, and I am an average cook. No special kitchen skills. I make my purees on Sunday nights after the little one is asleep, while I chat in the kitchen. It does take an investment of time and a willingness to grocery shop and prepare food. However, the stragies have truly revolutionized the way I think about food and children. I still offer ""traditional"" vegetables in ""pure"" form, but I also have changed my thinking about what goes into my child's body and how to best nourish him. Every dish, no matter how simple, contains wholesome ingredients and that makes me feel good.

Bottom-line: there are lots of reviewers who may judge these ""deceptive"" strategies, but I'm willing to bet my kiddo has eaten more broccoli, cauliflower and carrots this week than most kids eat in a month!",58 people found this helpful,1
3,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,5,A Must for Your Kitchen Cookbook Shelf,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"My toddler actually has no problems eating vegetables, but it's nice to find creative ways to increase intake whenever possible. I've only used a few recipes so far, but I love this book for its organization and presentation. The information is organized so clearly and the style of the book looks like old Betty Crocker manuals from the early 1900's (but without the rampant sexism! Win!). All of the relevant information you could want, from charts on how to prep vegetables; how to stock your pantry and kitchen; nutrition guidelines; tips from other parents; I could go on and on. Every household with toddlers and children should have this book.",4 people found this helpful,1
4,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,5,one less food headache and they are eating healthier.,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"I have children that are extremely picky. I can't figure out how in the world to get them to eat vegetables, or better yet, try them. So for now, I'll sneak them in their food. My favorite is the grilled cheese with a layer of pureed squash or pumpkin. Or the mac and cheese with the same. The kids don't notice (unless you over do it). I feel better that at least they are getting a better intake a vitamins and minerals without an argument.",5 people found this helpful,1
5,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,5,Love this book - it works!,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"Like this cookbook for so many reasons. Have several cookbooks that base their recipes on purees. Like this one because the purees are flexible and varied. Most of the recipes have turned out vary well.

Baking the choclate chip bean cookies now, although using pecans instead of walnuts. The cookies have proved popular with even non health food eating people! However, I did change the recipe a little in that I chop the beans after draining them. By the time one chops them some are rather mushed but that works out just fine.

Family also loves the avocado choc pudding an unlikely combination but really works. We process it until almost smooth. Husband likes a little bit of texture to it.

Have found breading recipes don't work as well as hoped.

Spinach in brownies, great disguise! Turned out more like fudge though. Very moist and dense.

Love some of the muffins. Peanut butter Jam muffins were great. Made with almond butter. The ""jam"" I used was simply dried apricots soaked overnight and then pureed. No sugar added so lots of nutrition as well as sweetness.

Note: the cream cheese centered muffins/cupcakes are nicknamed ""ugly muffins"" in our house. Taste great (and I reduce the sugar as I so in most recipes) but the spinach is very visible. Tends to separate out and be in a layer after the baking and the color is horrible. Hence the nickname ugly muffins. But my son is picky about texture and taste so if can get one bite in and it tastes good we are ok. Anyway, we like them and so many veggies in one sweet treat!

My son is picky enough that he doesn't eat most of the items used to disguise the other items. Example: He doesn't eat mac and cheese! But this recipe book has enough ideas that I have found new ways to sneak his veggies in.

He is 3.5 and now knows I sneak them. He has a choice to eat them straight or disguised and always chooses disguised.

By the way, we did everything by the books to start him right, including eating a wide variety of things when nursing and pregnant and introducing him to a wide variety of foods as a beginning eater. Hopefully he will outgrow this pickiness but for right now I am just concerned that he gets his nutrition.

So my motto is never let a desert go wasted - make them all count with disguised veggies! No his diet is not made up of deserts, but they are certainly a great place to increase his veggie intake.

One of my favorite things about this book, in comparison to others of this genre, is the flexibility of purees in given recipes. Also, it is a beautiful cookbook! I, too, am convinced some of these recipes simply don't work and try to imagine that they were actually tested before published. But so many great recipes that do work for us that they more than make up for the ones that don't work!",11 people found this helpful,1
6,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,5,Love all the recipes,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"Love all the recipes! Getting my family to eat healthy foods is a nightmare, but with these recipes they have no idea all the veggies they are actually eating! The recipes taste great, and you cannot even tell there is healthy fruits and veggies in them. I would recommend this for anyone with picky eaters in the family!",2 people found this helpful,1
7,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,5,Delicious Recipes even if you Love Your Veggies,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"I purchased ""Deceptively Delicious"" back in January but was initially tentative about trying this cookbook due to the fact that I had to make a puree for every recipe. Once I got over that hurdle and decided to make the ""Green Eggs"" I was hooked. I then wanted to try other recipes because the eggs were so delicious. They are the easiest recipe in the book and basically require you to sauté baby spinach, which you then incorporate into scrambled eggs. You do need a small food processor to make the recipe but you could also use a blender.

The next recipe I tried was the ""Ranch Dressing."" It was good on salad but not as good as a dip. The ""Greek Dip"" was delicious for dipping veggies (celery was especially good) and crackers not to mention pita bread. The recipe uses chickpeas and artichoke hearts and I found I could make it in a blender. My food processor only holds about 1 cup of ingredients so for this cookbook you may want to buy a larger food processor.

The last two recipes I tried include the ""Turkey Chili"" and the ""Oatmeal with Sweet Potato."" For the turkey chili you need to puree carrots and red bell peppers. I had never steamed red bell peppers before but it worked well and at the same time I cooked the carrots in the boiling water. Less to clean up later! For the turkey chili I added an additional tablespoon of chili powder and 2 teaspoons Emeril's Original Essence because I felt the recipe needed a little more seasoning for adults but it was perfect for kids. I think the reason the recipe needed more salt is because it calls for low-sodium chicken broth. Instead of the kidney beans I used some butter beans I had in my pantry. For the turkey recipe it would have been helpful to know how many carrots and red bell peppers you would need. I found you needed about three carrots and 1 ½ bell peppers. Other than that fact the recipes are very easy to make and don't take as much time as you would expect them to. The oatmeal recipe is delicious with the addition of pumpkin pie spice and peanut butter.

All of the recipes I've tried so far have worked very well which has encouraged me to try even more. Since I have more sweet potatoes left over the ""Hot Cocoa"" with pumpkin pie spice sounds delicious. You may also want to try ""Blueberry Cheesecake Cupcakes with Yellow Squash and Spinach,"" ""Frozen Yogurt Pops,"" ""Macaroni and Cheese,"" and ""Chicken Salad with Cauliflower.""

Once you make a puree and realize how easy it really is you will love this cookbook! Highly Recommended even if you love eating your veggies. I try out new recipes every week and this is one of my favorite cookbooks this year.

8,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,5,Nieces Love the Recipes,Format: Hardcover-spiral,Our niece does not like to eat vegetables. We purchased the book for her mother and she is able to sneak vegies into the foods and our niece is none the wiser. I saw a segment on the Today Show and remembered how impressed I was with the ingredients used and how the children were eating the food and liking it. Nice recipes for the family.,,1
9,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,5,Best thing that has happened in my Kitchen,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"I love this book. I think more than anything it got my brain thinking on how to add more healthy things to meals. I took it and ran, coming up with many of my own combinations using the principle puree idea. She gives great tips and its real things the kids eat. My kids love the recipes and gobble it up. I happen to be partial to the look of the book itself, its pretty and something that looks like it fits in my kitchen. The photos are great of the foods and the tips and how too's for making the puree's are excellent. My freezer is now well stocked with puree's to add with anything. I have had friends who said they didn't care for the taste of some things but I think you have to remember that the recipe is not designed to taste like grandmas brownies but a healthy and yummy alternative, I don't think you taste the veggies at all but it may have a slightly different taste than what you might be used too. I have VERY picky eaters and now feel that I am feeding them more nutrious items. The pink pancakes are to die for! So I highly recommend this book, and for those who are determined to pick at recipes and feel the need to be critical you just go on not eating your veggies. And for those who think an idea was stolen I don't believe she is wrong to want to publish her recipes and her methods, even though they may be similar to another book, it is her opinion and recipes.",5 people found this helpful,1

12,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,5,Thank heaven for these ideas!,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"At age 2 my child suddenly became a vegetarian and refused all veggies and most fruits. When I saw that the stage wasn't an overnight fad, I had to resort to sneaking in the veggies. This book has given us some wonderful recipes that my daughter absolutely loves. Since she's a big carb craver, I favor the ""bread like"" recipes the most. She has no idea she's getting zucchini, carrots, cauliflower, butternut squash, spinach or beets. So far, broccoli is the only thing she's caught me on - and I can't blame her... it's pretty strong no matter what you try to do with it.

I HIGHLY recommend this book for parents with little eaters who have decided to somewhat reject the obvious good foods. You've got to get those foods in them, even if the amounts are minimal, until they grow out of the phase. I also crush a chewable ""super green"" tablet that is fruit flavored and mix it into her juice -- it claims to offer a full serving of veggies and spirulina. Recipes and a supplement may be extra work for a parent, but these little efforts donate generously to your child's overall health.",4 people found this helpful,1

We have made 3 recipes so far and have had no problems with them at all!! I recommend for the scrambled eggs with califlower to use the whole egg not just whites for the recipe. And be aware of being a little gassy afterwards! :O) I even modified a recipe for banana bread for zucchini bread and it turned out great! We love the mac and cheese with yellow squash. She tells you in the book how to prepare all the veggies for steaming and all nutrition values! I love it!! I'm trying the spinach and carrot brownies today and taking them to work for all to try out!! You must read all recommendations from her on how to prepare and eat the meal sometimes she says to eat cold or you can really taste veggie!

It makes the most wonderful, fluffy, moist and tasty eggs I've ever had, AND you get the benefit of a serving of vegetables as well. I'll use it a lot, not just for myself, but I have already given my son, who is a chef and has a toddler, some ideas for his family as well.

19,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,4,Comforting deception,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"I bought this book out of the growing frustration I was experiencing with my 3 year old son's reluctance to try anything green, red, orange, etc., specifically in the form of vegetables. Jessica's solution of creating an arsenal of purees that can be easily added to recipes, is a brilliant, although, interim solution to the issues we are having at mealtime. I'm happy that my son is getting the nutritional benefits of adding vegetables to his diet, but I'm afraid that this form of deception is really not teaching my son to overcome his resistance to eating fruits and vegetables, or expand and develop his palette. The recipes are easy to follow and some are even quite tasty -- the brownies are a huge hit at my house. I have certainly learned some tricks to creating healthier versions of our breakfast, lunch and dinner staples.

I have also learned that my husband, another picky eater and one who does not like vegtables, has been really happy with these recipes.

I bought this with the intention of my husband and I getting healthier. When I bought this book, I noticed a lot of reviews also mentioned 'The Sneaky Chef', so I decided to buy both and review side by side.

While they are both fundamentally the same (adding vegetable purees to food), hands down 'Deceptively Delicious' wins.

1. It is spiral bound - this makes it much easier for keeping open to follow a recipe.

2. There are many full page color photographs of the recipes

3. The purees are much easier. Another reviewer mentioned this and I agree. Jessica's also uses more types of vegetables.

4. The other book takes up a large section of the beginning with... stuff. Reasons to write the book, details about her family, how she's qualified to write the book, etc. Jessica has a small intro, but otherwise get's right down to it - nutritional information, the puree's and recipes!

I do think the other book has value, but I believe Jessica's has more value. For the reviewers that want to complain about Jessica copying - I was under the impression these were released about the same time - which means they would been under development about the same time. Besides, isn't every cookbook a copy, for all intents and purposes? Look at all the books about: barbecuing, pasta recipes, chicken recipes, baking, cookie recipes. They are all fundamentally the same with minor differences... just my .02!

I tried the scrambled eggs this morning, they were good! They don't taste like traditional scrambled eggs cooked in butter with all the yolks, etc... but these were good - and it felt right knowing I was getting a healthy breakfast. Oh, and for the person who says ""you are only getting a tablespoon..."" in some recipes that may be true - but it's a Tablespoon more than I would have had without it!

One area of concern, not so small either, is that the amount of vegetable is rather small.

First of all let me start by saying:
!) I don't have young kids any more BUT
2) I HATE veggies but I know I need to eat more of them, so any system that gets them into me and the grownups in my life: BRAVO!

Yes, I'd recommend BOTH books and here's why. They each have their strong and weak suits.

Pluses:
DECEPTIVELY DELICIOUS has
A) pictures, which is helpful and fun
B) tips and comments by her taste-testers
C) used one type of puree for each recipe
D) is spiral bound so it will lay flat. The whole layout is really nice, just as a cookbook to read!
E) doesn't beat you over the head with the whole nutrition thing

THE SNEAKY CHEF has
A) combination purees, which add a lot of variety and ease into the cooking part
B0 really cute names for the dishes. Makes it easy to remember!
C) isn't afraid to use butter and milk!
D) goes seriously into the nutrition thing. Almost the first half of the book is a prelim and explanation of the whole concept.
E) the recipes seem to taste a bit better!

Minuses:
DD. The recipes are a bit bland. If you're cooking for an adult palate, you need to add more spices. For example her ""Chocolate Chip Cupcakes."" I suggest substituting milk (even skim) for the water, add an extra T. vanilla and 1-2 teaspoons of cinnamon. One of the veggie purees her recipes call for aren't covered in the ""how to prepare puree"" part.

SC: Very few pictures. It's not spiral bound but a trip to Office Max can take care of that for you. (Best tip I ever got regarding cookbooks by the way and found it here!) It's a bit ""textbook"" like. I get the whole nutrition thing already.

I wish both books went into greater detail about the pureeing part. They're pretty good but if you're not a veggie person to begin with, you might not know what is the proper consistency.

529,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,1,(3) weird proportions and (4) totally useless from the point of getting your kids to eat ...,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"A book written by an American housewife who never (1) learnt to cook or eat well, with (2) obsolete and WRONG nutritional advice, (3) weird proportions and (4) totally useless from the point of getting your kids to eat vegetables.

1. The author admits they never go out to restaurants. Probably never tried anything better than diner food. What she cooks for her family is even less inspiring than school cafeteria. I was hoping to find some good recipes that would incorporate pureed vegetables well, but there is nothing I would feed to my family who know better than chicken nuggets, burgers and cheese sticks.

2. Almost every recipe calls for low fat this or low fat that. The author states that you have to use ""low fat or nonfat dairy"" which is an old advice dating back to the 1960-ies, disproved by recent scientific research. (Full fat dairy is now recommended for children and adults). She also uses flavored yogurts (sugar!!!) and margarine spread!!! (horror!)

3. Even just by looking at some recipes I can see the proportions are off.

4. The amount of vegetable puree in each recipe is so miniscule, it’s negligible from nutritional point of view. ½ cup of vegetable puree per dish for 4 people means that each person will get 1/8 cup of vegetable. That’s one tiny floret of cauliflower or a teaspoon of peas. If, according to the author, a person has to eat 1.5 to 2.5 cups of vegetables per day, your child will have to consume about 16 full servings (say, of mac-n-cheese) a day. )))) Good luck.

Also, most of the nutritional value in vegetables comes from vitamins. Some recipes call for 3-4-5 hours of cooking (stewing), which would totally destroy any good stuff that originally was in that ½ cup of (already cooked) broccoli puree to start with.

Overall, the concept of adding vegetable purees to your dishes is great, and the idea of freezing and storing puree in small jars is good. I would go for 1-1.5 cups of puree in dishes like pasta sauces.

Otherwise the book is useless and in many cases just bad obsolete advice.",118 people found this helpful,0

532,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,3,I really wanted to like this...,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"BUT...I must say that I am disappointed. I would recommend to someone to borrow the book from the library and save their hard earned dollars. With a small amount of common sense and a little effort, you can easily replicate the idea on your own.

Three stars because the instructions for the purees and the ideas are worthwhile. The spiral binding is convenient and the nutrition info is interesting. I like the section about stocking one's pantry and the tools.

So far, I've tried a variety of recipes with lackluster results.

Here is a sampling of the results I've had.

Scrambled eggs: my children thought the eggs were spoiled because they looked and smelled differently. One of my girls has not eaten a scrambled egg ever since - more than a year ago!

Coffee cake: What doesn't come across through the recipe or the photo is that there is a layer of butternut squash between one side of the coffee cake and the other. Like a butternut squash sandwich. My children wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. When it cooled and had time to sit around, it was good! I enjoyed it and had the whooooole thing to myself. Another attempt on the same recipe (round pan instead of square)resulted in a gummy coffee cake that ended up in the trash. It cooked for longer than the recipe states but it seemed to never get cooked. Not sure what I did wrong but it was a disappointment.

Tuna: Made on Sunday night for hubby's lunches. DH didn't complain (he wasn't told about the cauliflower) but it sure was odd that there was half a container of tuna left come the end of the week.

Banana Pudding Pie: they took a finger taste and refused to eat it. I thought they would have liked it. Their main complaint was that it looked too orangey and not like bananas. It was super, super sweet (it actually hurt my teeth) and ended up in the trash. Even I couldn't have eaten it and I love sweets. I thought putting two boxes of instant pudding in one recipe without milk seemed odd. It would have been better with one box and milk so I might try my own version of this recipe.

Chicken nuggets: a loser, the breading falls off. The kids wouldn't so much as try it.

Chocolate chip cookies: a sort of winner. Sort of...my children knew there was something foreign in them (chick peas) but they ate them anyway because of the chocolate chips.

Spaghetti and meatballs: a loser. The meatballs fall apart before they can even be eaten because there isn't anything to bind them together. So much for meatballs. Try spaghetti and meat sauce (which is what I did).

He eats everything on his plate and many times asks for just veggies for dinner. I get tired of making the same meals, so I thought this would be fun to change things up a bit. I was very excited - bought many of the items suggested for the pantry and started pureeing. My first recipe was the Rice Balls - rice shaped in balls with spinach puree. I am a bright woman, I can follow a recipe, I followed it to a tee, but the mix was watery and did not shape into balls. I ended up throwing out the entire batch. Next, I tried the pancakes with sweet potato - fine. Yesterday, I made the chocolate cake with beet puree - awful! it was dry and tasteless! I am a bit disappointed, but I have added cauliflower puree to box mac and cheese and also to package rice mixes. The veggies in both did not change the taste of the product (actually made the mac and cheese taste better) and I got my son to eat a 2nd serving of veggies in 1 meal.

Lastly, I made the grilled cheese recipe with sweet potato puree and it was really, really good! Shredded cheese and sweet potato puree made the filling creamy and you only taste the cheese!

The recipe that I tried, Italian Meatloaf, was somewhat tasty and an absolute tragedy all at the same time:
I am no stranger to making a pretty giant mess when cooking--it comes with the territory. But for this recipe, a simple combination of this and that, the extreme mess that ensued was grossly unnecessary. It was ALOT of this and that, and I must have done 3 loads of dishes to make a single pan of meatloaf. The mess aside, the recipe, while again tasty(ish) was not without its shortcomings: 1) it was more like meatloaf soup. Why did she have us soaking breadcrumbs in milk? If the breadcrumbs had been left dry, the loaf would have had a more desirable, un-wet texture; 2) sweet sweet sweet. Ketchup and carrots? too sweet; 3) how long should I cook it for? ""Until it is no longer pink."" Really? I am going to pull the loaf out of the oven, then out of the soupy pan, cut into it, and see if it is pink? And if it is, I have to put it back together and back into its liquid bath and back into the oven? Luckily, owning a scientific mind, I chose to stick a thermometer into the center to make sure it was up to a safe (and I guessed cooked) temperature. How long did that take? About and hour longer than she suggested. This is a major problem, food safety wise. I wonder how many kids have been eating undercooked meatloaf?; and, most importantly, 4) there really aren't any vegetables in this recipe, at least not any more than are normally in meatloaf. Certainly it did not contain enough veg to warrant leaving them off as a side dish. Many of the other recipes contain even less veg than this meatloaf! I scoffed at one that contained about 1/4 cup of puree, and the recipe said ""serves 8-10."" I can say scoffed, because I know things. Pointless.

I can't say that I am too excited about trying anything else from this book. I told my my husband that if he ever runs into Jerry, that he should give him a piece of my meatloaf and see how he and his wife like being so filthy rich.

I only glanced through the pages and saw how to sneak the vegetables into the food which I thought was a good idea at the time. Not until after getting home and looking through the actual recipes did I realize he wouldn't eat any of it mostly because of textures, colors or simply trying something new. However, if you have kids that eat basic foods like spaghetti and meatballs, grilled cheese, mozzarella sticks or beef stew and don't notice slight changes made to their food, then these recipes may actually work. Also, don't let your kids see what your doing to the food if they're picky (hence the ""deceptively"" in the title. Knowing the vegetables are in there is reason enough for them to not try it. This is contradictory to what I have learned since. Having my kids help prepare food, especially with my Asperger's son, has been far more effective with them trying new things and eating their vegetables.",One person found this helpful,0
657,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,2,Too much sugar,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"My main criticism for the recipes is that they contain a ton of sugar. So if you're going to use the recipes, halve the amount of sugar. (And maybe double the amount of puree.)

I borrowed this book from the library and I read through most of the recipes before I tried one for Applesauce Muffins - I followed the instructions exactly as written and then added whole flaxseeds which did not affect flavour/texture. While they tasted okay, they were also super sweet, a bit too wet on the outside and dry on the inside, and contained only 1/2 cup of carrot puree (and 1 cup unsweetened applesauce) between 12 muffins, which makes it equal parts carrot and sugar in each...except that there was extra sugar in the streusel topping. I may as well have made carrot cupcakes and not iced them and called them muffins - it would've been more nutritious. I also calculated the nutrition in the muffins - each is 232 kcal, 16.6g of sugar (only 2.5g of which was natural sugar).

I had also made the carrot and spinach brownies before in the past when she presented it on a talk show at the time of the book's launch - the carrot bits were still visible and the brownies took on a strange green-black-brown hue. Not a problem since I was making this for adults, but could be a problem for others. The taste again was very sweet, so the vegetables were undetectable, but not a brownie I would make again because it turned out very flat and hard.

A surprising sugar addition was made in her frozen yoghurt popsicles, where the sweetness in the fruit would've been sufficient, and her liberal use of confectioner's sugar to disguise some of her stranger additions.

All in all, the concept is very easy to replicate using your own recipes - replace existing ingredients with healthier versions (like trans-fat free margarine for butter, skim milk for whole milk, ground turkey for ground beef, whole wheat and whole grains wherever possible) and then adding pureed vegetables of similar colour to the food (carrot in non-chocolate baked goods, spinach in chocolate baked goods, cauliflower with egg/cheesy dishes like omelettes and mac n cheese and so on). Which means you can basically turn any of your own favourite recipes into healthier versions without needing this book.

Please also note that there's an imbalance of sweet items in this book compared to main meals, and many of the main meals are similar (ie. sloppy joes, burgers, meatballs, meatloaf).",,0

While in the final reducing stage of making sloppy joes, I realized something tasted off. If definitely needed sugar to cut down the acid in the tomato paste and something else. A quick Google search revealed dry mustard and a dash of hot sauce. So a tablespoon of brown sugar, tablespoon of dry mustard and a dash of hot sauce were the difference between delicious and gross.

659,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,2,The Book Looks Better Than The Food Tates!,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"I was excited about using this book at first. One because it was given to me as a gift and two, I don't put purees into my own dinner recipes. Doing the purees takes a lot of time. I was smart and put all the things that take the same amount of time baking or steaming time in at the same pot or oven at the same time. Still, messy and long. Putting them in bags... MESSY! I used rubbermaid containers instead. I had 2 whole weeks off from work and testing recipes from new cookbooks is a hobby of mine, so yes, I made EVERY SINGLE THING IN THIS BOOK! I was NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL!

I'm a pastry chef and work for a 5 star resort, so I know how to cook and follow recipes. So lets get started. The tofu nuggets, were okay, but the coating doesn't stay on. The green eggs, we're okay. I think it was the sour cream that made them taste somewhat decent. The Sweet Potato Pancakes... okay, but not fluffy like pancakes should be. Brownies, GROSS! Meatloaf, GROSS! My 2 year old seriously eats anything and he didn't eat any of these things. The chicken nuggets were worse, they either burned or were not done in the middle. The cake, GROSS! I mean, I make sweet things for a living and I couldn't make myself take more than one bite. The yogurt Popsicle was okay, but my son who loves yogurt, took one bite and said, ""not like mommy's"" and gave it back. My husband, not a picky eater at all, actually told me to stop making and serving him this nasty tasting food. He asked me if I had lost my mind and what happened to the salt and pepper.

On the night I made the spaghetti pie, he took one bite, said, ""I'll be right back,"" and came home with a carne asada burrito. That says a lot, since my husband has never turned down a dish in the 10 years we've been together. I also had to make a second meal every time so that my son would eat something. The grilled cheese was the only thing he actually ate all of, but I gave him yogurt on the side and he loves dipping stuff into yogurt. I believe that is the only reason he continued to eat it. Textures weren't right either. I believe a cookbook should have recipes that come out the way they say they should and then if you want to tweak it later to make it better fine. But no one should buy a cookbook and make the recipes and have all of them taste bad and then tweak them to make them better. That is just sad.

I'm sorry Mrs. Seinfeld, but you are just not a good cook in my opinion. I'm glad I didn't buy this book. My son ate more raw veggies than anything with the purees in them. I guess I'm just a lucky Mom with a kid who isn't picky. I mean my son loves sushi. I also tried these recipes on my friends and their kids... NO GO! When I had people over for dinner last night, one of the kids asked me if I was making anything from that new book I got. I said, ""No,"" and he ran off yelling, ""she's not making it from that nasty book so it will be awesome this time!"" This says a lot.

Also being a chef, I know a lot about nutrition and even if you fee your kids 3 of these recipes a day, is not going to give them the daily vitamins because you are taking already cooked veggie and re-cooking them and if you're only using 1/2c of a veggie and it gets spread between 4-6 people, there is no way you are getting the amount you need.

I think the layout is fantastic and the art is cute. The photography is well done. All in all, I think it is pretty and informative, but when it came down to it, the recipes just didn't work for me. I'm the type of person who tends to scoff when I read bad reviews on recipes, thinking, ""They just can't cook!""
But I can cook and bake!! And all the bready things I tried in this book simply didn't cook through. I cooked the beet pancakes until they were beet pancake chips and they were still RAW inside! I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda so they'd puff up and maybe cook through. FINALLY they looked like the photo, but once pierced with the fork they deflated... and were raw!!!
It was actually funny. Sitcom funny. Like maybe it should be on Seinfeld with Elaine thrashing around the kitchen with frizzy, stressed-out hair and fuschia beet puree spattered all over the walls.
The best part was when my two-year-old came in, asked for a bite, and devoured the awful raw pancake whole saying, ""It's good!""

However, it's so much work with all those purees! In theory, the plan of making several bags of purees and freezing them, then using them right when you need them, sounds great. In reality, we only did it once, used our food processor and made several bags of different purees and froze them. Our son was not crazy about the new taste of his food.Plus, so much work! Because then we needed to cook for ourselves too.Maybe Jessica Seinfeld is a stay-at-home mom and had more time on her hands. We didn't.The years went by and our son is now eating more things.

674,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,3,Somewhat overhyped but a good source of ideas,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"I liked the cute '50s style illustrations and the spiral binding is brilliant - every recipe book should have this! I was also pleasantly surprised by the absence of photographs of Ms Seinfeld and her photogenic family and instead the focus on the food.

I was somewhat disappointed in the recipes offered. There is no desire to stretch my kids in terms of what they will happily eat - the focus is purely on how to integrate more vegetables into their diet. Reading some of the quotes from other Moms within the book, my overriding impression was that my kids eat pretty well (not something that I would normally have said). I guess if you are a mom whose kids won't touch vegetables in any form, this book is right for you.

What worked for us: Both Mac Cheese version 1 and the burgers were simple and liked by my kids.
What didn't: The Spag pie was horrible. My chicken nuggets were a failure. The quesadillas were eaten grudgingly and I won't be repeating them.

I should add that given the extra work that it took to prepare these recipes, I felt more put out when they didn't go down well than I usually would.

Overall the main thing I've taken from this book is the idea that you can sneak pureed vegetables into the foods that your kids eat. In terms of specific recipes that I will be referring to again and again, there wasn't a lot here for me. A better source of family recipes is ""Whining and Dining"" by Emma Waverman and Eshun Mott, available from Amazon Canada - my kids loved their carrot recipe!",20 people found this helpful,0
675,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,3,Good premise but could be better,Format: Kindle Edition,"I, along with the masses, purchased this book based on Oprah's show. It had a very good concept (hiding veggies in everyday food) to ""deceive"" your kids into eating healthier. Also the ""mmm's"" from Oprah and her audience made us viewers believe in the book also. Well, here comes my review.

Jessica Seinfeld brings the concept of pureeing veggies and fruits and mixes it in recipes. For instance, she has a brownie recipe that hides pureed spinach. She has breakfasts, main meals, and desserts.

Let's focus on the good points. I think it's a really great idea to puree veggies and fruits and measure 1/2 cups and put them in plastic bags. Well, putting them in plastic bags can be awfully unfriendly to the earth, so i would suggest freezing them in ice trays or something to that effect. She suggests that you have everything pureed ahead of time (like choose one day of the week dedicated to prepping purees) and then use them throughout the week. So, that's a really innovative idea.

Now how about the cons: The recipes are ""alright"". I think the flavors are geared more towards adults. The mac and cheese was very thick with cheese. That may sound like something good but it still didn't beat box mac and cheese. My kids didn't like the chicken nuggets at all. The burgers were mediocre. The desserts were pretty good but were loaded with brown sugar. I mean, even if it isn't refined sugar, it's still sugar, right?

So, all in all, I don't use Mrs. Seinfeld's recipes. In turn, I incorporate her puree idea into my own cooking and recipes. For instance, I'll make scrambled eggs with pureed broccoli instead of spinach and call it ""green eggs"". I put butternut squash puree into box mac and cheese and that's devoured cleanly. Basically, I do the purees on my own terms.

But the book isn't completely a bust. It does offer healthier dessert alternatives even if there is a lot of brown sugar in the recipes. But I wouldn't do any of the other recipes.",4 people found this helpful,0
676,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,3,Not as great as I thought,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"I got this in the hopes of hiding veggies for my picky kids as well as myself. Unfortunately I had many problems. If you aren't prepared with your puree's in advance (which you won't be when you start) be prepared to be in the kitchen from lunch time until you serve dinner. The puree's and recipes in this book are VERY involved.

Another point is the pictures. It's great to have pictures of the products, but I'm guessing not all of them are the same exact recipes. I don't know how Potato Soup is supposed to come out white when you add in 1 1/2 cups of pureed carrot.

Some of the recipes, I believe, are worded strangely. I mixed up a couple items when making them. The recipes are so involved, you have to read through them a few times, and even then it's still confusing. For the Rice Balls, the wording makes it sound like you add the breading to the egg wash, which in my haste, I did, which ended up with not so great results.

I also don't believe some of the recipes are very kid friendly for picky kids. I made the Chicken Nugget's, and my kids wouldn't touch them. Flaxseed meal in the breading? That's not very appealing to kids that are used to McDonalds and frozen dinosaur nuggets. (My children are 6 and 3.)

On another note, I will say I made the Applesauce muffins and thought they were fabulous. My kids still wouldn't eat them, though.

I will still resort to this book for some recipes and keep trying the ones I haven't done yet. But I believe it will mostly be for tips to help me incorporate veggies into my regular recipes.

I'm going to try the other book, The Sneaky Chef.",,0
677,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,3,Has some value but needs a lot of tweeking to be healthy,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"First of all, my kids eat vegies and I think whole vegies need to appear on every plate no matter if your kids like them or not. It takes time for some kids, but they learn to like them if you do. I agree with other reviews about the sugar content. Way too much. I cut it down in the recipes. I also use all whole wheat flour instead os a mixture of both. If your kids are not use to it, start with 1/2 and 1/2 and then gradually eliminate the white flour. All that said, I like the concept behind many of the recipes. The banana bread is a big hit in our house. I figure why not add additional vegies to some of the non-vegie items that my kids enjoy. True, the vegies have lost some of their nutrients. But I would still rather have a % of vegies in their muffin or other food item than none at all.",,0
678,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,1,Waste of time.....,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"I have made one recipe from this book and I will not be making any others. The chicken nuggets were terrible! I followed the directions exactly and they were a huge dissapointment. The puree (I used broccoli) is not hidden at all, so there is an obvious layer you can see when you bite into the nugget. The puree does not stay on well and makes it hard to coat the chicken. The worst part was that the recipe calls for a very small amount of olive oil to use for cooking 1 lb. of chicken. My first batch was very close to being burned because of it, so I had to use quite a bit of extra olive oil to cook the rest correctly. It seemed like the puree actually made the chicken absorb more oil than normal, and as a result, they were too greasy for me.

I will admit that my kids did enjoy these nuggets, but not nearly as much as my own homemade version. I will try adding the flaxseed meal to my own recipe next time. After eating, I asked my 8 year old if he knew what was in them that was different, and he immediately said ""broccoli."" Thankfully, my kids eat their vegetables fine, but I just wanted to try these for something different, and since Oprah raved about them.",124 people found this helpful,0
679,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,3,Hit and Miss,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"First let me say, if you're one of those folks who criticizes the whole idea of sneaking veggies into foods, don't get this book. That's silly.

Also, it is true that if you rely exclusively on sneaking veggies into your kids' meals, they will 1) not get enough of them and 2) never develop a taste for them. So, you do both, sneak and serve. Duh! Why is everyone fussing about one way or the other?

As to the recipes themselves, we like some; we don't like some. The macaroni and cheese with butternut squash is a huge hit at my house and with the neighborhood kids! The two muffin recipes we've tried (PBJ & Oatmeal) were tossed out after one serving eaten by each of us. I have never come across a cookbook where I like all the recipes in it, though, so I wasn't surprised or dismayed.

So, am I glad I bought the cookbook? Yes, because it gives some good ideas and some good recipes, but it is not the solution to all your woes if you can't get your kids to eat your veggies (nor do I think it is intended to be that). Furthermore, it is like any other cookbook out there; some will work for your family and some won't.",5 people found this helpful,0
680,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,1,Not deceptive and not delicious- just disappointing,Format: Kindle Edition,"My friend told me about this book when she saw it on Oprah. I got excited. I don't really have a picky child, but she could always eat better. I was even more excited when my mother bought this book for me for Christmas, not even knowing I wanted it!

The yellow cake I tried first. It said to pour into a 9-inch cake pan. Naturally I used a 9 inch round cake pan. Instinctively, I told my hubby that it seemed wrong, that maybe I should put it in 2 9-inch rounds, but I followed the recipe. The edges cooked but I was right, the recipe should have said 9 by 13 pan OR 2 9-inch rounds. So we ate on the edges of it. It was really tasty, but it uses a box of cake mix which is NOT healthy, even with pumpkin added.

Then I tried the Applesauce Muffins, which I had my 3yr old help make. HORRIBLE. There's no disguising the butternut squash taste. My daughter can't even eat a whole muffin, and she's usually a good eater. The topping was great, but the muffin itself was aweful. It left an undesirable aftertaste in my mouth.

This morning I tried the scrambled eggs. One small hesitant bite and my daughter was crying. They aren't deceptive b/c they don't look normal, and they don't taste normal either.

We're trying one more recipe tonight, and then I'm done with this book. It's not worth it to me. It really is a LOT of additional work, and the added nutrients are not very measurable in a single serving. I think most who have looked at it closely would agree.

697,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,3,Mixed Results,Format: Hardcover,"I tried three of the recipes in this book. I have two kids - a 3 yr old who eats everything and a 7-year old picky eater who will eat pretty much everything as long as it's fried or a stick (Carrot stick, cheese stick, pretzel stick).

First I tried the French Toast with pureed Sweet Potatoes. It didn't take any longer than making regular French Toast - I had pureed the sweet potatoes the day before. Both kids and I loved it! However, the recipe called for 4 eggs to make four pieces of French Toast. This was way too much - I ended up making about 8 pieces of French Toast. My non-picky eater enjoyed the leftovers. The amount of sweet potato in each serving was negligible.

Next I tried the Tofu Nuggets. I made it with the spinach puree. It was quick to make the spinach puree because it cooks so quickly. Again I followed the recipe and had much more egg/spinach dip and breadcumbs than I needed so some was wasted. My non-picky eater loved them and enjoyed the leftovers again and again. I thought they were delicious too. My picky eater wouldn't even taste them - they looked just like chicken nuggets but had a greenish tint. And again there wasn't much vegetable in

Last I tried the Rice Balls. This was extremely labor intensive and time consuming. It took almost two hours to make. I had to cook rice, cook chicken, puree the chicken, cook spinach, puree the spinach, then mix it up and roll it into balls. Then once the balls were made - dip them in egg/spinach dip and then bread crumbs, and then pan-fry them. My kids enjoyed helping me make the rice balls. My non-picky eater finished his plate and asked to have them again tomorrow night. My picky eater wouldn't even taste them.

I did like some of the other ideas in the book such as serving a crudite to your kids while you make dinner, and now that I have some flax seed meal and whole wheat flour in my pantry- I will substitute that in to make my regular recipes a little more healthful.

I probably won't bother making Tofu Nuggets or Rice Balls again, though.",3 people found this helpful,0

I bought it to trick MYSELF into eating the veggies that I knew I needed, but didn't want to eat. A friend's birthday came up, so I thought, 'fun, I'll try the Blueberry Cheesecake Cupcakes'... DISASTER. Then I tried the Spaghetti Pie for my husband and me. DISASTER. #Too much sauce, not enough pasta, doesn't need salt with the ""bottled tomato sauce"" and looks NOTHING like the picture! Her kid's review: ""The crust is so crunchy!"" WHAT crunchy crust?? A soupy mess!) It then became a running joke amongst my family and friends: Don't make me cook a Jessica Seinfeld recipe! Up on the shelf it went.

Then, I had a picky toddler. So, I pulled it out again and gave it another shot, trying different recipes.

The Chocolate Cake with Beets calls for WAAAAY too much cocoa in the frosting. I stopped short of the 1/2 cup it calls for, and it was still yucky and bitter. I had to add sooo much confectioner's sugar to make it better. Cake was good though. Try a different frosting; don't even attempt hers. Ick.

The chicken nuggets I tried with spinach puree, and they were tasty and my child ate some, but the breading does fall off, as someone else noted. The second time I tried, for some reason, they completely fell apart and were inedible. Not sure what I did differently?

The Chocolate Chip Cookies with Chickpeas tasted like cardboard.

The Coffee Cake with Marshmallows and Butternut Squash just didn't work. Again, looked NOTHING like the picture, and was impossible to ""layer"".

The Spaghetti and Meatballs recipe SURELY has a typo, as 1/2 lb. of ground turkey certainly couldn't need a whole cup of breadcrumbs!! I added the other 1/2 lb. and followed the recipe and the meatballs were great.

The Egg Puffs are good, the Mac n Cheese was decent, and the Grilled Cheese pretty tasty.

They were pretty good, but tasted a little too much of the whole wheat flour. The brownies had a sort of rubbery texture, but the flavor was good. The oatmeal cookies were tasty but had a cakey texture and fell apart after I stored them in an airtight container. Basically, they aren't healthy if no one will eat them. And my kids are really not that finicky. Since I really like the idea of adding the veggies, I'm willing to tweak these a little to see if we like them better. Also, alot of the recipes use the light tub margarine and I just think that stuff is gross, so I'm going to start subbing butter instead. I'll try the mac and cheese next....",,0
700,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,3,healthier eating and great ideas,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"I saw Jessica on the Today show and went straight to my computer to order her book. I don't have any childen, but I'm always looking for healthier ways to prepare food for me and my husban. Since purchasing it last fall, I've used DD at least twice a week. Once I got the book in the mail, I made a big produce run at Trader Joes and went to work in the kitchen pureeing the vegetables and some fruits. This process was easy, as I followed Jessica's tips. Concerning the recipes, so far, I have not had much success with many of the entrees. I have found that the proportions of certain ingredients are at times not correct when cooked with the other ingredients at the specified temperature and time. For specifics, check out the notes below:

chicken fingers - using the skillet with spray and oil has only resulted in burned chicken in my kitchen. perhaps it might be better to soak the chicken in the egg/veggie mixture for longer and then bake them in the oven after rolling them in the crumbs. i've made other chicken fingers this way before, and they've always turned out just fine

spaghetti pie - too much sauce and meatball to cook at the designated time. modify as needed

chili - i tried this tonight and found that my end product looked nothing like the picture in the book. i believe that the cooking time should be extended to cook down all the liquids (26oz of broth) that are added

Has anyone else experienced these same problems?

Most of my success while using DD has come from the breakfast and dessert recipes. Although they can taste bland at times and are sometimes weird in consistency (dense applesauce muffins), they're quick and effective at providing small, healthy meals and/or snacks. At night, I often find myself whipping out some banana bread, muffins, or chocolate dip to satisfy that late night appetite. The ingredients are simple and much more healthy than any store-bought brand. For breakfast, my favorite is the oatmeal -- all around goodness.

One dessert disaster that I do have to mention is the chocolate pudding. Although I believe I followed the directions explicitly, ALL I could taste was the avocado, no matter how much powered sugar and chocolate powder I added. It was HORRIBLE. I even put in the food processor to blend it to get that creamy consistency I see in the book, but nothing helped. Has anyone had the same experience? (update: Later did I learn, watching Rachel Ray, that ripe avocadoes are the best at using in ingredients. Look for them to be almost black, not green which I used for this recipes. I believe if I had used ripe ones, it might have turned out better).

In closing, I just wanted to confirm that some of the negative feedback provided by other reviewers is true -- the off-putting taste and smell of the cauliflower, the sometimes bland taste of certain recipes, and the seemingly insignificant amount of puree goodness that is used in the recipes. However, I believe the larger take-home point from the book is changing the way and types of food you prepare in the kitchen. It certainly has helped me think differently about traditional recipes and how they might be altered by using non-fat yogurt instead of oil, brown sugar and maple syrup in place of more refined sugar, and whole wheat flour and flaxseed meal as a substitute of white flour. So, for quick easy meals and good healthy cooking ideas you probably haven't thought of before, this book would be a nice additon to your collection.",One person found this helpful,0
701,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,1,"Deceptive yes, delicious...not so much.",Format: Hardcover-spiral,"In some of my cookbook reviews, I like to add that I have 12 years of professional cooking experience. Most of my experience has been in 4 star restaurants and upscale dining, but I can honestly say that I think upscale dining is easier than getting a kid to eat healthy food! I don't have any children yet, but I saw my sister struggling to get her three year old son to eat veggies and it made me want to take a good look at this cookbook as well as the ""Sneaky Chef"".( I have saved my comments on that cookbook for its own review.)
Basically, DD is just another celebrity cookbook. The idea is a good one, but it's been done much better (See the Sneaky Chef review). Right from the first few pages I was slightly disappointed - where is all the nutritional content? There are only 41 pages of informational material (even less when you take out the biographical segments). Then came the recipes and I see a common problem immediately- taste and texture. Take the Scrambled Eggs for example. After inspecting the list of ingredients I saw that both nonstick spray and olive oil are being used-overkill if you ask me. I am not a big fan of olive oil with eggs. Olive oil tends to leave behind a funny aftertaste with eggs so I usually opt for the Canola spray with excellent results. Two tablespoons of parmesan cheese was way too salty for me - it would, however, completely hide the fact there was any cauliflower puree in the dish. I also opted out of using the ¼ cup of reduced fat sour crème as my husband will never touch the stuff. If I can't hide the taste of sour crème from an adult, how can I hide it from a child? But cutting down the cheese and the sour crème leaves you with sort of a runny mess so you would also have to cut down on the puree used as well. Which begs the question - if I have to rearrange this recipe so much, why am I paying for it? The bottom line as a consumer is that you are paying for each and every recipe and if you have to significantly change them, if they are not near perfect right from the start, then you have purchased a defective product. At the bottom of the page, it is proudly announced that this meal is not only high in protein (coming from the eggs, 6 in total) but also that it provides half of the daily value for vitamin C. I recently read an article that stated that just 2/3 cup of freshly squeezed orange juice provides more than the RDA of vitamin C. Why not just serve your kids fresh orange juice in the morning rather than putting them through this breakfast fiasco?
Again this, is just ONE of the recipes I tried and was not satisfied with. I had problems with the thickness of the Brownies, the same mushy mess issues with the Chicken Nuggets, the Pancakes not fluffing right and tasting pretty awful, and lastly the gooshy Meatloaf which I can make ten times better with my own recipe which includes grated veggies in it! So, no, not even the fine dining line cook and pasty chef can get these recipes to work properly!
Ironically, the only recipes that seemed worth while were ones I also found in The Sneaky Chef, like the Green Eggs. So what does that say about this book? Most book stores will take it back if you exchange it for some thing else...(see review of the Sneaky Chef).",23 people found this helpful,0

A few of the recipes are good, such as the french toast, but many need significant tweeking to be something I would want to make again, and by then, what's the point. After making the pancakes with sweet potato this morning, I've had enough. Putting that much puree in with the pancake batter made it way too thick and they did not cook up like a pancake at all. They had a good flavor, but they were mush basically on the inside. I don't know if this was the fault of the recipe, or maybe it was the type of pancake mix I used, but either way, I'm done with this. I've only had the book for a few days, but I think I will be returning it early to the library. I did make a considerable amount of the purees when I first got the book which I think I will start experimenting with on my own to make recipes healthier. At least then if things don't turn out very well, it's of my own doing and not following a book that was supposedly tested many times and reviewed by a chef.

719,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,1,Alot of work and frustration...,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"After reading mixed reviews about this cookbook, I decided to purchase it. I wish that I had listened to the experienced. I would have saved myself alot of EXTRA TIME in the kitchen as well as frustration when the end product wasn't all that great.

From the breakfast menu, I have tried 5 of 12 recipes. The only one that I will make again is the Oatmeal on pg. 68, eventhough, I had to doctor it to make the texture more pleasing on the palet. The Pancakes on pg. 57 were like cake batter. No matter how long I cooked them or flipped it, they were still raw in the middle.

The mealtime recipes were more successful for me. I have tried 7 of 39 recipes. The Chicken Nuggets on pg. 75 were good, though there was alot of the breadcrumb mixed left when it was all said and done. WASTE. The chicken salad with yogurt... YUCK. The Burgers 1 on pg. 111 were not bad, again with some modification. My family liked those, as well as the lasagna, sloppy joes, and the grilled cheese sandwiches. The Spaghetti Pie from pg. 120 was terrible. I didn't even look like the picture.

The dessert recipes were my favorite... or at least I thought they would be. To sum up what we thought of these... NOT EDIBLE. The icing recipe that is found with many of the cake or cupcake recipes was so BAD that it became comical at our dinner table!

I question some of the ingredients used, too. There was alot of reduced-fat things... cream cheese, yogurt, cheddar cheese. Isn't there alot more salt and more preservatives in reduced-fat items than in the REAL stuff?
The ""writers"" claim that the reduction of fat leaves more room for calcium. I just don't know....
I wonder if Seinfeld created these ""wonders"" alone or if she had someone help her. Maybe her neighbor...

Overall, I wish that I had just invested in a cooking class! There would be less frustration, and I probably would have spend less time in a classroom than I did in my own kitchen with this cookbook!",6 people found this helpful,0
720,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,1,Errors in the recipes,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"When I received this book as a gift I was quite thrilled and eager
to try getting my toddler to eat different foods. I tried a macaroni
and cheese recipe first and my child actually ate it, so I
subsequently made my purees ( messy ) and got ready to cook. I tried the
Rice Ball recipe, which was long and tedious, and when I got to the 4th
step I encountered an error in the recipe.

The recipe consists of cooked rice and other items rolled together,
then dipped in a mixture of egg and veggie puree, then rolled in cracker
crumbs. The 4th step says to beat together egg and the vegetable puree with
a fork and then to put the crumbs in ""THE"" bowl.

Being that I was distracted by both a husband and toddler, I followed the
directions exactly, prior to reading ahead(yes, my error). For those who cook,
you can imagine what a mess this made. I didn't second guess the cookbook
and did what it told me to do, putting the crumbs in ""the bowl"" with the
egg/veggie puree. Needless to say, it didn't work out. Everything stuck
together in one, big, sticky, gloppy mess. There was no rolling rice
balls in anything! The recipe should state that the crumbs need to
go into ""a bowl"" or ""a seperate bowl"". I should have known better.

The other error, or simply lack of proofing, is in the Chicken Nuggets
recipe. The first step says to combine various ingredients in a bowl,
and then the sentence continues to say ""on the paper or foil and mix
well with your fingers"". Nowhere in the recipe does it call for paper
or foil, and why, if you're using a bowl to mix your breading, are the
instructions calling for paper or foil? The wording too, ""on 'the' paper
or foil"" I also have to question. Just what paper or foil are they talking about?
It doesn't appear that they double checked the recipes or the wording
of this book before it was published which is very unfortunate for those
of us who bought it or received it as a gift.

By the way, the chicken nuggets weren't eaten by anyone and were also
difficult to get cooked the whole way through. The recipe would work best
if the chicken were slightly flattened.

After trying two odd recipes that weren't very good, I then tried one
more stab at the book, making the mac and cheese with beans. It was
simply awful, and contrary to the quoted celebrity at the bottom of
the page, yes, you can indeed taste the beans in there!

For the amount of work that these recipes take, and the dubious results
that I have encountered with each that I've tried, I'm ready to pitch the
book in the trash. There are too many ingredients used, and everything
I made was visually not very attractive, not an incentive for a
picky toddler that's for sure! I will also say that many of the photo's
in the book are not very flattering to the entrees, so that doesn't entice
me either. A definite dissapointment.",14 people found this helpful,0

723,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,3,"A fine book, but there's a more efficient method for making purees",Format: Kindle Edition,"I received this cookbook a few weeks ago, and was very excited to get it, since I am interested in making healthy food for my baby when he becomes a toddler. I haven't used the recipies yet, but I talked with another friend who had mixed success with them (she said the pasta sauce and pancakes worked with her very picky eater, but not the chicken nuggets, which she made with broccoli and her child could see the green and wouldn't eat it).

I was surprised, however, by the inefficient pureeing process described in the book. Seinfeld suggests making purees once each week and keeping them in ziploc bags. For those who are strapped for time, there's a more efficient way: Make the purees once each month or so and freeze them in amounts you will need in the freezer. You can use ice cube trays to freeze 1-2 tbsp. portions, and large (Texas-style?) muffin tins to freeze 1/2-3/4 c. portions. When the portions are frozen, transfer the premeasured portions to freezer bags and put them in the freezer, where they will keep well for two months (or more in a chest freezer). If you have trouble getting the frozen portions from the muffin tins or ice cube trays, try putting them in a pan of hot water for a few seconds to loosen the sides.

The portions can be thawed in the microwave when you need them. It's true that fresh vegetables and purees are the best nutritionally and in terms of taste, but frozen ""deceptive"" veggies are better than no veggies for the picky eaters in the family. For anyone who wants to try this system and feels daunted by making purees every week, freezing the purees might be worth considering.

Only 2 have been worth making again: sloppy joes (although they were a bit mushy) and the Italian Meatloaf.

The recipes I won't be making again are: coffee cake (too dense plus the secret veggie is NOT a secret: you can see and clearly taste the squash), banana bread (too dense and tasted like cauliflower), egg puffs (took too long to bake - not any better than just plain old scrambled eggs), chicken nuggets (they burn! easily! so how am I going to get my girls to eat them even if I can hide sweet potatoes if they are completely black because the breadcrumb mix burns so easily?!), spaghetti pie (way too much sauce and the raw meatballs added to the top do NOT bake in only 30 minutes!), aloha chicken kebabs (again burns even before you add it to the pan and the recipe does not call for nearly enough oil to brown the chicken).

I'm just disappointed. Each day I carefully planned and organized so I would have the proper veggie steamed and pureed and each night my girls (and I) pushed our plates away.

My kids would ask why their pizza had green stuff smeared on it. Other ideas are not only silly, but wasteful as well. For example, Mrs. Seinfeld suggests adding pureed squash or carrot to an egg mixture for making French Toast. How much of the vegetable is really getting onto the food? I have two kids, 11 and 8, who eat all kinds of vegetables. How? Because they were served vegetables (non pureed) on a regular basis from the time they were toddlers and they are expected to eat what they are served. It's not always easy, and it's not perfect but it sure beats liquifying vegetables and sneaking them into foods.

On the negative side, the desserts did not hit the mark. The chocolate chip cookies failed with both kids, and the brownies came out very bitter and had a funny texture.

839,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,1,Deceptively not so good...,Format: Hardcover-spiral,"Quesadillas- The flavor wasn't too bad if you dipped in Salsa otherwise you can taste the squash and it doesn't come out crip it comes out pretty mushy.
Chicken nuggets- The breading doesn't get very crisp, the breading falls off when cooking and if you use brocolli the nuggest have a green look to them.
Chocolate cake with beats was good. Chick pea chocolate chip cookies were good the first 2 days. After that the chickpeas got so hard you couldn't chew them.
Brownies are spongy.
Grilled cheese you can taste the veggies and it is pretty mushy tasting
Egg Puffs were just gross
French toast isn't too bad, but my kids won't eat it
Chicken soup I didn't care for, but my son's did eat it.

Overall the recipes don't taste that bad, but the texture wasn't that good. I have one son who isn't a fussy eater at all and he wouldn't eat these recipes. Normally he eats anything you give him. Actually I think I made a mistake feeding him food from this cookbook because now he is a fussy eater when he never was before. Now my other son who is always fussy and we can't get him to eat much of anything wouldn't eat these either. He was the reason I bought the book, but he won't have anything to do with the food. He even likes cookies, cakes etc, they are his favorite. He didn't like the cookies. He did eat the cake and that was about it. I would say don't buy it.

All I can say is Jessica Seinfeld must have given a lot of money to Oprah's charity not to mention the shoes to have her give such an overwhelming seal of approval.
My children did taste the puree inside because the food tastes so disgusting and nothing like what ""chicken fingers"" normally taste like, so they immeditately wondered what was wrong with the food. Not only was the taste unpleasant but the consistency was mushy and soft~ nothing like a mushy soft chicken kebob to make you and your children feel sick.
The brownies were vile and both my children spat them out on their plates.
I have never seen children turn their noses up at choclate cake or brownies and with these receipes it was a first.

844,Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food,3,"The reviews, the recipes, the nutrition factor and Oprah.",Format: Hardcover-spiral,"A couple of thoughts on this book, its reviews, the recipes, the nutrition factor, & Oprah.

- First, re the reviews that are here - it seems that no one can post a negative review without immediately being shot down - this really makes me believe that the reviews are being monitored by interested parties in the book's success - perhaps, publisher, family & friends? If you note the first few reviews of the book, they were all made by members of Jessica's family, so they're here and active.

Second, re the recipes - I've made a few of them, and some work and some don't. The burgers have *way* too much garlic - maybe to overpower the cauliflower? The mashed potatoes are good and, on my own I put some cauliflower puree into some frozen spinach, and I ended up not needing to add any cream to jazz it up - it just worked. So, as a jumping off point, the purees are inspirational to incorporate into your own existing recipes - these recipes on their own, are a little touch and go, but overall the concept is brilliant - even though Jessica cannot be credited with having the idea first, as seen by the description of The Sneaky Chef, published previously.

Re the nutrition factor - this is becoming a sticky point as people bring up the question of why nutritional content was not included, especially considering that the foreward is written by a nutritionist. I think I can guess why - a 1/2 cup of spinach puree in a batch of brownies or 1/2 cup of cauliflower in a pot of mashed potatoes does not go a long way once you divide that up into individual servings. There is no way anyone is getting a full serving of vegetables from this technique, but I tend to be in the camp that thinks more veggies is better than less, even if the more is negligible. And, it may be even less than negligible considering the additional cooking beyond the steaming that is robbing the veggies of their enzymes.

Finally, re Oprah. I watched yesterday as Jerry came on to promote his new Bee Movie, that Oprah happens to be in. I realized this is why she had Jessica on in the first place and say, not the Sneaky Chef. There's definitely a bit of cronyism going on. And, was telling when Oprah groused about the book being number one on the bestseller list that Jerry thanked everone for contributing to ""Seinfeld World Media"".

All in all, I have no regrets about buying the book, and I'm sure I'll be doing purees from here on out.",84 people found this helpful,0
