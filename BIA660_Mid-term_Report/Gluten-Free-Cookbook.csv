2,"*This isn't ""dairy or sugar free"" or aka Paleo Diet friendly book. ATK never claims it to be. So stop complaining, if you are. This is a book for people who are Gluten Free but wants maximum flavor and ""gluten like foods.""

I watched ATK on TV since I was in college when I first starting cooking my own meals. I love the how to chips and the science behind all the recipes. I discovered I am gluten sensitive about six months ago and I wanted some REAL TASTING bake goods. I bake often for friends and families. The thought of never baking again, was depressing. I borrowed several GF cookbooks from the library to test run some recipes before purchasing ATK's How Can It Be Gluten Free . So far, my whole family loved the bake goods from this book.

I have a few notes before I get to my favorite recipes:

1. You do have to understand you will need to make your own GF ""flour mix"" but the upside is, there is only ONE FORMULA for everything in this book. Another book I tried had five mixes and I haven't been able to gather all the items needed for that book.
2. You must read the intro to each recipes at least once. It gives you important information. Sometimes, you must read tips of similar recipes to get all the info. For example, under Chocolate Chip cookies, there is a tip on how to make your own frozen cookie dough.
3. If you want real tasting box pasta, read the test kitchen recommendation. IT IS SO GOOD!
4. Bread recipes need a standing mixer. Most recipes mix by hands. Some call for a blender or a food processor.

I bought the book for the bake goods so those are the recipes I tried multiple times with success:

Banana Bread: My husband brought a loaf to work and they are asking for more.
Lemon Pound Cake: Brought it to a party and no one suspected.
Applesauce Snack Cakes: THE BEST and EASY RECIPE in the BOOK. My twins would eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Chocolate Chip Cookies: Moist and Chewy. Brought it to several parties and everyone love it.
Chewy Sugar Cookies: Perfect texture, maybe a bit lack in favor but my kids love it.
Classic Sandwich Bread (which I also made hamburger buns): Taste better than anything store bought but it does dry out fast.
Dinner Roll: My husband loves it with lots of butter, but it already has a lot of butter in it!
Cheddar Cheese Bread: If you miss a good cheesy bagel taste, this is a similar in flavor. The texture is slightly crumbly. Yeast Free.
Multigrain Sandwich Bread: BEST BREAD recipe that I tried so far, moist and flavorful. It kept moist for four days in an airtight glass container.

Recipe tried but need to try again:
Oatmeal Cookies: I thought they were dry. When it ran out before the chocolate chip cookies which I thought was better. So what do it know.
Blueberry Muffins: They were pasty and pale but my husband and the neighbors thought they were pretty good.
Brazilian cheese Bread Roll: They have a Asian Mochi like texture. My family did not find it appealing so I ate most of it myself.

I am yet to tried the pie crust and pizza crust recipe but soon, I hope. It will be Thanksgiving before you know it."
2,"Fan-freaking-tastic. This old celiac has learned to bake! I have tested these recipes on family and friends who are not gluten free. In many cases they say these recipes are indistinguishable from traditional flour. In one case, the Sugar Cookie, they say it's the best they ever had, bar none.

The recipes are a bit complex at first. But over time the prep becomes second nature. When I try a new recipe, it doesn't feel complex now. In fact many of the steps are similar across similar recipes.

I've made all of these over and over again. All of them are better than anything from the store or even a professional gluten free bakery. I've been to dozen of bakeries across multiple states. I thought many of them were fantastic. They all pale in comparison to what I can make at home now, and for much less.

The flour this book taught me to make costs me less than $2 a lb. I used to purchase mixes that were $6-8 per lb. Quite a savings and much better than any other I've tried.

Recipes that others love and ask about:
Sugar Cookie
Chocolate chip cookie
Brownie
Pie Crust
Pancakes
Pumpkin bread - all the sweet breads
muffins
meatballs

Recipes that are at least better than store bought:
Bread
Pizza crust - I hear volume 2 has a better recipe
breading for fried foods

This was all off the top of my head.

Some people can't have dairy. I've heard volume 2 is better in this regard. There are many recipes in volume 1 that require milk products and don't have substitutions that work as well."
2,"I've been a subscriber to Cooks Illustrated for years now. I've always adjusted their recipes containing gluten for my Celiac husband, and avoiding their baking recipes has been disappointing. So I was thrilled to see this cookbook in my Amazon suggestions.

I've so far flipped through many recipes and reviewed the recipe for sandwich bread and pizza crust, and am looking forward to trying both out this weekend. What I love about this book is the science and testing for each recipe is recorded with the recipe so you know why certain ingredients are added or omitted. Then if you want to adjust a bit you can do so with the knowledge of why a recipe is built the way it is.

The big bonus in this book: there is a recipe for a gluten free flour mix, but weights and measurements for two other popular store bought flour mixes are provided for each recipe. If you've ever tried to buy ingredients for a gluten free flour mix in a regular grocery store you know it can be tough to find some, but easier to find pre-packaged mixes, so this is a huge bonus.

The only drawback I can see is for someone who is not a more seasoned cook/doesn't enjoy cooking, some of the recipes are advanced. The directions are always easy to follow, but the outcome can vary depending on your take on the directions. For instance, instructions are provided on how to measure flour for the gluten free flour mix. Part of the instructions include tapping or lightly packing the flour as you scoop it into the measuring cup. My tap vs my husband's tap are completely different levels of pressure, and would result in slightly different flour mixes which could vary a recipe enough to be noticeable. Luckily weights are included, which is the best way to measure baking ingredients, but there are other directions included that could be taken differently.

Really looking forward to trying many of the recipes in this book! If you have a gluten intolerance and love to cook, this is a must buy book! Or if you're fed up with the yucky pre-packaged gluten free foods, give some of the recipes in this book a try.

UPDATE: The sandwich bread recipe in this book makes THE BEST gluten free sandwich bread I've ever had. I don't have to eat gluten free, so I know what real sandwich bread taste like, and this is pretty darn close in taste. It's right on the money with texture, not gritty or dry at all, and only a bit denser with a nice, crisp crust. Plus its a really easy recipe. Most of the ingredients are easy to find even at your local supermarket. The powdered psyllium husk was the hardest to locate. Check your grocers health supplements aisle, or stop by a vitamin shop. It's used as a laxative. I ate two pieces of this bread on the same night and didn't have any issues, so don't worry about accidental laxative effects. Also, the only 4.5"" x 8.5"" loaf pan I had is glass, and that worked great.

UPDATE 2: I continue to try recipes in this book and haven't had a bad one yet. I haven't delved heavily into the baking section other than making several loaves of the sandwich bread (which is still amazing), but I did try the arepas recipe which was great. The Almost Hands-Free Risotto can be found in back issues of Cooks Illustrated and likely in their other cook books, and is fantastic as always."
2,"I worked my way through college as a cook and sous chef at some of the nicest restaurants in my area. I loved it, but there were few good work opportunities, and using my degree was the much better option, when I finished my degree. I love to cook as a method to de-stress, and I'm still a pretty d@#n good cook. When I found out I had wheat allergies, and a short time later, my son had celiac, I had a lot of baking, frying, sauce-making, just all kinds of stuff to re-think and learn to do in another way.

America's Test Kitchen is often used by friends (who still work in restaurants) and myself to settle arguments about the right way to make something. As we learned long ago, taste is paramount, and ATK spends an enormous amount of time developing each recipe. When they get it right, they usually kill it. They are based in the northeast, and their taste is often a bit blander than my Southern sensibilities, but their pursuit of clean, fresh flavors and honest cooking methods (only getting complicated with the preparation when it makes a significant difference in the final product) is widely respected by professionals.

I bought this as soon as I saw it on Amazon. My wife wants simple recipes she can make in the bread machine or crock pot, and this is NOT that cookbook. However, if you want gluten free recipes that rival the best 'regular' recipes you've ever had, this is the book you want. If you really want to understand what each ingredient or step in a recipe adds to the final dish, this is also the cookbook you want. We rarely eat any sort of fried food, because it wasn't a priority. When I read through the fried chicken recipe in this cookbook, I had an 'a-ha!' moment, and I made Chicken Fried Steak for the first time in two years. I thought my wife was going to cry, and both of our boys were super-excited. I don't cook out of this book all the time, because they're out to create the best recipes, not the quickest recipes (there are some that can be made in less time, but many of the recipes we like best have longer, more complex preparation).

I HIGHLY recommend this book, if you have sensitivities, allergies, or celiac-related disease and are tired of not-quite-satisfying copies of dishes you loved before discovering your health issues."
2,"Finally!!!!! I can bake a cake for friends without the angst before the first bite....when I tasted the chocolate layer cake I was almost in tears. Yum. Amazingly fudgy, moist cake...period. You won't find yourself saying ""It's good for gluten free"" with any of their recipes. They are great. The crumb is not sandy, dense, cookies are not gritty, muffins rise and cakes are perfection. Pancakes....oh how I have missed pancakes....I could kiss the feet of everyone who made this cookbook. The genius is in their flour blend. Make it. It costs less than the blends and it's truely the secret to success. I've tried Pamelas, Bob's Red Mill, Namaste, cup4cup, King Arthur Flour, Trader Joes, and Paleo blends of almond and coconut flour. Nothing has come near the texture and rise of their blend and recipes. The cherry millet muffins were lovely, The linzer cookies were good, but there is a typo in recipe so I had to guess the flour amount. Itâ€™s the only recipe error Iâ€™ve found so far. I also love their savoury recipes....all the comfort recipes that you miss. Drunken noodles with chicken, fresh pasta, corn tortillas, golden cornbread and sausage stuffing, Tamale pie, Singapore noodles with shrimp. Breaded favorites will turn out perfectly. Crispy chicken fingers, pan fried pork chops, fried chicken. For the breads... I always change the psyllium husk powder to xantham gum...I have better luck with it. The pizza recipe is long, and requires a lot of time, but the crust is fanstastic. Itâ€™s very flavorful and crisp, a bit chewy....my pizza obsessed son loves it. Iâ€™m not a fan of the quick bread tasting crusts, paper thin crusts, or soggy middles....this recipe avoids all three. Be sure to roll out pie crust dough thin-ish and bake until very golden brown. Itâ€™s only good crisp.
Oh, and I should really add that I appreciate the ""Why this works"" for each recipe. Their explainations have really helped me to tweak my own gluten free recipes. Also included are evaluations on ingredients, and other gluten free products. After purchasing almost everything mentioned, I can say that I agreed with almost all of their recommendations. They also have a little G-F testing lab box which will tell you how to substitute gluten free flour blends. I would not recommend substitutions, aside from subtle seasoning, however it is nice to have. This is such a great cookbook...not just great recipes. There's so much instruction. I immediately bought volume 2 and their Mexican cookbook. I'm sorry that I didn't have these years ago when my son was diagnosed with his wheat allergy. Note- the skillet cornbread is a nightmare to make...lifting a hot cast iron skillet in and out of the oven a few times. The cornbread is perfect, I didnâ€™t like balancing a hot cast iron pan full of batter."
2,"I do love gluten, and everything that has gluten in it. It does not seem to love me as well, though. This book has some very good choices for finding enjoyable substitutions for many things you should not have. A non-wheat bread will not taste the same as a wheat bread. You just can't get past that true fact. Regular bread in its most basic is wheat flour, water, salt and yeast. Using rice instead of wheat just will not have the same flavor. The bread recipe here, however makes a very tasty loaf: nice loft, nice texture, nicely browned crust and good even without the flavor of wheat.

They use a basic gluten free flour blend of their own, and recipes are tested with their flour as well as a couple other name brand GF flours for comparison so those could be substituted. There is a very wide range of recipes from trying different grains to pasta, comfort foods (fried chicken), bread, cake, cookies and pies. The techniques used are very different from what might be expected, but they do say why they have used them. The pizza crust for instance is so wet that it must be shaped using a cover of plastic wrap. It has a long, slow bake to set the crust, then the pre-baked crusts are either frozen or topped and baked again. Delicious, slightly nutty, and I may try making it even thinner to experiment with making crackers."
2,"Pre-diagnosis (wheat allergy, among other things), I considered myself quite the chef/baker. Immediately following a diagnosis, I felt really lost and, after a few devastating GF baking failures, I felt like I would never be able to bake or enjoy my old favorites again. Since getting this cookbook, all that has changed. God bless the people at ATK for working so hard to get every recipes in here just right - and have your family saying, ""Is this REALLY gluten-free??"" They really worked through the mechanics and technicalities of gluten-free baking, and exhausted the options to make every recipe taste truly delicious. (No more ""just good enough"" - these recipes are delicious all on their own.) I haven't had a single letdown (not so with other GF cookbooks). This isn't meant to be a terribly thorough cookbook (hey, ATK: PLEASE release a part II!!), but does give the newly GF eater a good start, and the seasoned pro a new view on the traditionally dry, crumbly GF foods. Try the pancakes (oh, my gosh - divine, even after being frozen!), the pizza dough, the blueberry muffins, the drunken noodles (I have non-GF eaters raving over these every time I make them!), the Brazilian cheese bread rolls, the yellow cake, the brownies - and you'll see what I mean. If I could go back in time, I would tell my newly-diagnosed self to start here before branching out!"
2,"America's Test Kitchen is, by far, the ultimate on everything cooking and baking. The only thing, is that gluten free baked goods can not stand up to their gluten filled counterparts. The texture is so different...just not right. You know, the mouth feel of the delectable cakes and cookies you've always known? Just as they always do, ATM tests their recipes over and over... it's just that these didn't get all the way to perfection. That are though better than other GF recipes.

The biscuits in my picture were a total bomb. They were super heavy, dry and didn't taste right (ATM has specific guidelines about baking times, so they'll be cooked properly). I didn't eat any of them... my eggs were naked. I've decided that I'm going to just continue to do what I've been over the last couple of years. I eat gluten free without having any cookies, cakes, bread, etc. I used to be a diehard of consuming baked goods. Honestly, since I took them out of my diet, I don't miss them one bit. Really...."
2,"We've all been taken in by the extravagant claims and promises on various Web sites: ""Amazing Gluten-Free Cookies!"" ""The Best Gluten-Free Sandwich Bread!"" ""You'll Love These Gluten-Free Muffins!"" And then you try the recipe and end up throwing it out because the results taste and look horrible.

I'm a good cook and baker (my friends and family say ""great,"" but I'm trying to be modest here). And when I try a new recipe, I almost always follow the recipe to the letter so I can see how it works. But none of the gluten-free recipes I've tried have ever worked. I sometimes wonder whether the people posting those recipes ever actually tested the recipes.

Baking is all about chemistry. You can't just substitute a gluten-free flour in a recipe that calls for wheat flour and expect the same results. The folks at America's Test Kitchen knows this, and devoted quite a bit of their expert resources to sussing out how to create gluten-free versions of our favorite recipes. They explain the science behind it, too, so you understand why each recipe works.

I've tried several recipes in this cookbook, and they are all delicious. If you want to make pie crusts, cookies, bread, etc., you start by putting together a gluten-free flour blend (I got everything I needed from VitaCost), and then following the recipes. So far my favorite is the chocolate chip cookie recipe, which I have made twice. My daughter, who is sensitive to gluten, loves them and of course doesn't have to suffer the after-effects that normal chocolate chip cookies impose.

Although you might expect this cookbook to contain only gluten-free equivalents of baked goods, it also includes other gluten-free recipes, such as recipes containing quinoa.

If you are looking for an easy way to transition to gluten-free baking and cooking, this is a great book to use. With the explanations of why each recipe works, you'll be a lot more informed about how to adapt your own favorite recipes as well."
2,"One of my kids has celiac disease and I get migraines if I have any trace gluten â€” Iâ€™m not willing to do the celiac test. The rest of my family misses the days of my endless bakingâ€” we never ate store bought breadâ€”and as my terror of gluten contamination grew, my baking was greatly curbed. Eventually, I started attempts at producing GF products and the ingredient lists are so long and the results are frankly disappointing unless it has been years since you last tasted real food.

American Test Kitchen to the rescue. These recipes absolutely work. My non-celiac family members (we have six kids) joyfully eat these baked goods with no complaints, and my picky pallate is amazed. Everything from pancakes, to biscuits, to pound cake, absolutely delicious. Beautiful crumb, no sandy feel in the mouth. As I read through the book, I finally learned the how and why of gluten free baking. Even the artisan bread is fantastic!

Buy this book. Find an Indian grocery so you can stock up on rice flour and other flours without paying a fortune, and get baking! Very, very satisfying results. My kids think I should open a GF bakery with these recipes. Um...no."
2,"If you know anyone who likes to bake and has to eat a gluten free diet, I can't recommend this book enough. I've been gluten free for 20 years (I suspect after a bad case of salmonella food poisoning damaged my gut) and so I've experienced the changing landscape of gluten free food. When I was first gluten free, the only bread and stuff you could buy was from a pharmacy and it tasted like chalk. I tried recipe books and they weren't much better. Following this book has meant I have been able to eat rustic multi-grain style bread and muffins that taste like the real thing (my gluten chomping hubby confirmed it) for the first time. It also reviews breads and pastas available in the superstore and gave us a great new suggestion for GF pasta. What I especially like about it (apart from the fact of course that the things I've made taste and look like the real deal), is that it explains why things work and the science behind the ingredients, it teaches you how to cook GF. It also only includes recipes that need converting, it is not one of those lazy GF cookbooks that include recipes for naturally GF meals like risotto or fruit salad.

The cons (which were not cons for me) is that this is a serious cookbook. There is a lot of discussion of the ingredients and a lot of ingredients. To make a successful GF loaf of bread for example you have to include a lot more ingredients than flour, salt, yeast and water. You make things from scratch, not only are there no cake mixes included, but you make your own GF flour mix (although throughout the book, it compares how each recipe fairs baked with their own mix and with the two best commonly available supermarket GF flour mixes).

The only small con that was a con for me - what is it with all the plastic wrap? Are they sponsored by the plastic wrap industry? I know GF food has a tendency to dry out, but seriously I cringe and think of the environment every time I reach for the roll that has been hiding in the bottom of the cupboard for years. And as for covering your bread with plastic wrap to let it rise - trust me it rises perfectly well under a clean cloth."
2,"I have always been a fan of ATK, but this has put my love for their cookbooks over the top. A year ago my daughter was diagnosed with a Gluten Intolerance and finding really good bread and cake recipes has been difficult. I like to customize recipes, but working with non-gluten flours is a whole different method. As an experienced baker, I love the science explanation and the differences of methods used. This really helps when I want to achieve something slightly different (flavors, tastes, textures), because I have an idea how to do it by their test results commentary. We have already made an ""Everything Bagel Seasoning"" bread that she loves. The brownie recipe is truly amazing without one change. If you are not achieving great results it is more likely your are not following the recipe's techniques - you have to read the recipe all the way through. As I said before, GF flours are a whole different method. I cannot wait to try more recipes and make them the whole family favorites. The GF book 2 is on my list to buy next."
2,I have bought a lot of gluten free books on Amazon and none of them compare to this one. I am shocked that this one is so good but I have tried several of their cake recipes and each one is better than the next. In fact I would be so bold to say that I like them better than their gluten counterpart!! Everything is explained so concisely and their are pictures to guide you along the way. I am looking forward to trying the other recipes. I really do love this book.
2,"WOA!!!!! For years I've been trying to figure out GF baking...failing over and over again, but mostly just really missing all the lovely tastes gluten can give and longing for those Artisan style breads. Along comes America's Test Kitchen (Cooks Illustrated ring a bell?) to save me! Every recipe in here is not only delicious...but the GF product/outcome is OFF THE HOOK. They use science and a lot of playing around with different ratio's to figure it out. From true, delicious dumplings to amazing sandwich bread to unreal Artisan-style loaves.... I'm so in love. Also, I'm getting to use my new home mill, which makes this even more fun, but totally not needed. THANK YOU to America's Test Kitchen for saving us from GF misery!!"
2,"My spouse is gluten sensitive, and I wanted to make BLTs for lunch without making him feeling left out, so I bought this book primarily for the sandwich bread recipe. The bread came out GREAT, while it's a little different in texture from a white flour hard wheat bread, it's very good and I could happily sub this bread for wheat bread and not feel deprived. There are a ton of other recipes in there, and I bought the second book as it contained even more bread recipes."
2,"Great book!!! They explain why the usual cheffy advice of, ""just swap out a gluten free flour and use your regular recipes"" doesn't work!
I took a chocolate cream pie to a gathering a few weeks ago. My instructions were to bring a GF desert I could have and that wouldn't make the others sick. (Guess they've had some of the bad GF stuff we've all been living with and been glad to have!) Anyway...the pie crust got rave reviews!! Words like, ""buttery, tender, GREAT flavor!"" came out of people's mouths! :) The biscuits are the best I've had since April 2011!"
2,"If you're looking for quick, easy recipes, this book is not for you. However, since I'm relatively new to gluten-free cooking and eating this is the ""encyclopedia"" of learning about and cooking gluten-free. Each recipe is analyzed and explained on a separate page indicating why this ingredient was used rather that another. Very informative. The recipes use, for the most part, easily accessible ingredients.
I highly recommend this for the novice, gluten-free cook."
2,"***UPDATE 27 May 2014***
We have now made Bread Loafs to replace store bought breads (using Lodge cast iron loaf pans), English Muffins (unbelievably delicious and taste just like store bought), Dinner rolls (eh, not great, but ok), biscuits (good and tasty). Overall, still amazed at the taste & texture. I tried some store bought stuff before this book and I couldn't eat it. NEXT - Cakes, pastas, and more deserts. DID I MENTION THE PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES?! Still Yum.

***ORIGINAL***
I admit, I am a meat eating, bread/cheese/whole milk loving, will eat anything that Doesn't say Fat-Free, Gluten Free, Hormone Free, Add Any Word Here Free, American. If fact the greasier, meatier, more caffeine, and sugar filled the better. So when I say the recipes in this book surprised me by tasting good, you know from where I'm coming.

A family member needed a diet change and without hesitation I bought this book. It was bought mainly because of the source. America's Test Kitchen. I have seen the show and know their reputation is good.

The long and the short of it is ATK (America's Test Kitchen) makes cooking GF (gluten free) as easy as any other home cooking. Just read the book and follow the simple guidelines, suggestions, and recipes. We use their flour in our old recipes (they explain how) and have found very few things lacking in flavor or texture (The pizza crust is OK, but not great).

It is has our full recommendation and we will update you as we explore more (made about 25% of recipes to date) Next are bread loafs and pastas. DID I MENTION THE (peanut butter) COOKIES!? YUM!"
2,"America's Test Kitchen, or ATK does a great job of breaking down their test process, explaining things to you so it's relevant and helpful while still being interesting to understand the science behind recipes that work.

No longer do you have to just trust that recipes work, they prove it to you and then tell you how they did it. Like a magician that spills his secrets.

the recipes in this book are thoughtful, helpful and most importantly pretty dog gone tasty in my experience.

If I could say anything critical of the book is that is only has a limited selection of truly helpful recipes, while adding ""filler"" recipes that are already gluten free to take up space. that is how it seemed to me.

Well duh recipes as I call them.

My personal favorites I have tried are the bananna bread and the lemon pound cake.

Word of caution. I think the ATK flour blend says you can use tapioca pearls, but you can't without hard pearls in your food. Ask me how I figured that one out."
2,"I've been gluten-free for three years now and have enjoyed some of the commercially available products, not to mention some baking success at home. But until baking from this book I have been missing out on the chocolate chip cookies of my childhood.

The chocolate chip cookies in this cookbook are, hands down, the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. Including those with gluten. My family loves these cookies.

That said, I'm also lactose intolerant and my stomach has been irritated after eating these cookies. The recipe suggests using soy powder as a sub or even leaving the milk powder out altogether, which is what I'm going to try next. So before you consider not buying this book because of the milk powder, consider giving it a shot with the recommended substitutions.

For a novice baker like me, this cookbook is worth it, even if I have to use another GF AP flour mix, because the descriptions of the how's and why's within each recipe, and for GF baking in general, are enough to make it worthwhile. Take, again, the chocolate chip cookie recipe - they explain how it differs from the original Nestle recipe and why it differs. This info alone is worth it to me.

I've also had luck with Jeanne Sauvage's gluten-free holiday baking cookbook. Armed with these two cookbooks, I feel confident that my family will enjoy great gluten-free baked goods throughout the holidays. Happy baking!"
2,"This cookbook has had a bit of overhyping. No, its not the be all and end all to gluten free cooking, but it is an excellent start. And its good to finally see someone tackling the how and the why science of what works and what doesn't. I found the tasters notes to be sometimes odd and unhelpful and contrasting greatly with my own experience. On the contrast, the notes by the editors explaining why they added an egg, specified one type of quinoa over another, and how and when to use additional tools like xanthan gum were enlightening and really made me think about my own experiences in cooking gluten free to see how I could guarantee reliable performance each time.

I also appreciated that even though they made their own flour blend, they kept notes of what worked on the prepared blends. Sometimes you just need a flour in a pinch, right? It helps to differentiate how their flour works vs. others.

What I didn't like? I didn't like that necessary pieces of information are in different places around the book. For example, a recipe specifying white quinoa did not explain why. Several recipes later, you learn the reason why white quinoa is specified over red or black. I would have welcomed more discussion about their flour blend as well. If you know flour needs more protein, why would you choose an egg over a higher protein base flour? I'm not accusing or haranguing, but I do want to know more about the science behind it, just like they would do in the Cooks Country or America's Test Kitchen cookbooks so that I understand when I cook on my own. It was little issues along the way that I thought would have elevated this from a really good cookbook to a GREAT cookbook.

Wouldn't it be great if this cookbook got some accompanying videos? I would love to see Julia and Chris make up some of these recipes!"
2,"My husband got me this as a present, because he has been impressed with the test kitchen recipes for other things. I have Celiac's Disease, and have 5 or 6 other GF cookbooks, all of which I have used a lot over several years, and have tried the many custom flour blends that each cookbook recommends. These recipes are the best I have ever tried, an their flour blend works with teir recipes wonderfully. I have not tried their flour blend with others yet. Sometimes GF baked goods can have a slightly slimy texture when chewed, or can have a bit of a beany taste, or in some other way be slightly ""off."" The recipes I have tried in this book are the best we have had. The biscuits are not flaky, but they are excellent compared to wheat drop biscuits, and the texture is fluffy, and the flavor excellent. The gingerbread cake is marvelous. This is a comfort food I grew up with, served warm with a lemon sauce. i substituted my own favorite spice combination for theirs, and the texture was perfect, and the product was not too sweet, an annoying characteristic of many GF products, especially mixes that you buy. I would serve this to guests that were not needing to eat GF, and they would never know. I am looking forward to trying out the other recipes. Besdies just baked goods, there are recipes for making fried chicken, as well as for home made pasta, and other four/bread crumb containing foods. No popover recipe, which I am sad about, but so many more that this book is going to be well used. Definitely worth the money."
2,"I don't know what I'd do without this book! My three year old daughter has ciliac and loves sandwiches. The sandwich bread and oatmeal bread recipes are easy and produce good bread. I have been able to substitute the gluten-full items in our kitchen using this book. Each recipe has King Arthur and Bob's Red Mill equivalents along with the science behind WHY these strange ingredients (psyllium powder, xanthan gum, etc) arebeing used to make the recipe. There is a product buying guide and an all purpose flour recipe in the front of the book to help you begin your gluten free journey. There is even suggestions for brand names of pasta and bread. If you don't already have one, you will need a food scale with this book. FYI- I recently crunched the numbers as to the price of a loaf of sandwich bread from this book. Depending on your local prices, of course, the ingredients for one loaf of this bread add up to about $4.80 per loaf. This is a bit cheaper than GF loaves from the local grocery store chain and on par with some of the fancy non-GF loaves (Arnold, Pepperidge Farms, etc)."
2,"I'm not a gluten free person, but thought I would give this book a try to help supplement my diet. I've tried a few of recipes and much to my surprise so far every one of them have actually tasted good. There are some very very slight differences in some of the textures, but not enough to figure out it's gluten free. For example I made a lemon pound cake and took it to work. I set it on the counter at 9 a.m. and told everyone it was the first time I have made a home made pound cake. By noon it was all gone. Later I asked everyone's opinion and asked them to be very honest. Only one person has something to say (she thought I needed to stir the batter a little longer because she thought she could taste a little flour). Of course she was also the one who ate two pieces. Once I told them it was gluten free they were shocked because they too didn't realize gluten free could taste that good. They asked if I could bake another one the next week. Of course I said yes.

Please note that the flour blends may be a little expensive for some, but also note that it goes a long way. By the time you purchase the ingredients for the flour blend the cost is about $22 dollars, but I got about 2 batches out of that for about 6 months use.

ATK did a outstanding job with this cookbook."
2,Finally a book that tells you HOW to adjust and not just providing recipes. The insights into how to change your baking is far more valuable than the individual recipes--themselves being quite good. A real winner for a baker that wants to understand rather than just follow a recipe.
2,"Great cook book. I've made quite a few recipes out of here: shrimp pad Thai, sandwich bread, English muffins, and the dinner rolls and they have all come out fabulous (my husband is especially fond of the bread and English muffins). I use the ATK flour which takes no time to make. I haven't found any of the recipes to be time consuming in the least, but then again I like to cook. They sometimes come out inconsistent but that is only because I don't weigh the ingredients rather I measure them but even with the slight inconsistencies -- which when making the bread I only notice in the actual consistency of the dough -- the food that is made is delicious.

This book was recommended by my sister who has celiacs and who uses it quite often when she bakes. In fact she made the sugar cookies and they are to DIE for. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has a wheat/gluten intolerance. It's totally worth the money. I also bought the second book and so far have made one recipe (Singapore noodles with shrimp) which was delicious and plan on making the millet salad. This is definitely my new go-to cook book when looking for GF dishes."
2,"My husband is gluten sensitive but was heartbroken when he realized he couldn't eat cake, cookies etc. My mom bought us vol. 2 for Christmas, and I bought this shortly after to have more amazing recipes. The brownies, awesome. The chocolate chip cookies, you wouldn't know they are GF (nobody in his office could tell the difference). I haven't tried the breads yet, but I have plans to dabble this summer.

The recipes are well written and offer substitutions for different GF flour mixes (as well as the changes to taste and/or consistency if any). They also have a ""make it yourself"" mix recipe that allows you to create a GF flour mix from scratch. The book includes a background to GF cooking, what certain ingredients do (IE xantham gum... never bake without it!) and even reviews of other GF foods. One thing I've learned is if the recipe says to let it rest, let it rest. I've had a few not so nice batches of cookies because I was too impatient to wait the 30 minutes after mixing and before baking."
2,"I haven't tried all of the recipes, but the sandwich bread recipe is amazing. I'm new to eating gluten free, and I think the bread tastes fantastic. However, I prefer the honey oatmeal variation to the original. I had much better luck with the oatmeal cookies than the chocolate chip ones, but I think that could be resolved by following the portioning instructions. I made the chocolate chip cookies smaller than instructed, and I think that caused them to spread too thin. I've had pretty good luck substituting their flour mixture in my regular recipes. The pizza crust recipe was WAY better, cheaper, and more substantial than the ones I've tried at other stores/restaurants. I would definitely recommend this book to someone who wants to do more gluten free baking."
2,"It's America's test kitchen, they've never had a bad book so far that I've personally bought. This book is great especially for people who want to know what gluten is, how and why it makes things with gluten taste how they do and of course they test everything so you get great results ! Most are baked goods but there are things like meatloaf and Mac and cheese, pot pie, etc that are comfort food that some people just don't know how to make it gf AND tasty. I love this book, I have it on my kindle, but I think I am going to get the paperback version as well."
2,"First of all, I've only made one meal from this book, but, boy, was it good. I made the spaghetti and meatballs and actually had family over for this dinner. They could NOT tell it was gluten free at all and were making ""yum"" comments the whole way through. I'm so excited to try the other recipes, including the lemon ricotta pancakes and the chocolate chip cookies. The book really does make it easy with its suggestions for brands for particular items such as the spaghetti noodles (which I used). Thanks again ATK!"
2,"One of the best Gluten-Free cookbooks ever. Luckily for us few medically diagnosed Celiacs, who actually injure themselves if they ingest gluten, the fad of eating Gluten Free has created a market for GF foods and knowledge that is worth satisfying. Many of the attempts to sell into this market are woefully short of the mark to provide gluten free foods that have taste and especially texture that can satisfy those of us who have few choices but care what we eat. The Test Kitchen people worked hard to discover the food science behind the techniques and ingredients that go a long way to teach methods that can apply to any food preparation for Celiacs, even beyond the creative recipes fully presented in this book."
2,"Lets face it, when you crave a chocolate chip cookie there is almost a primal desire for that cookie to taste like the chocolate chip cookie you remember from pre GF days. Yes, you know it has sugar and butter and things that have you sucking in your gut to do the button on your jeans, but if you eat a treat it should be worth the calories. Every recipe I have tried so far has been worth my new muffin top. Chocolate chip cookies with no grit, sugar cookies that melt in your mouth, bread that tastes like bread, and pumpkin bread that makes you realize that old dusty can of purÃ©e in the back of the pantry is worth it's weight in gold. I have a shelf full of cookbooks and this is my favorite. This isn't a diet book, this is a book for what you crave. Did I mention the chicken pot pie?"
2,"After reading the reviews for this cookbook I bought both versions, this and the second one. I've only had it 1 week and I absolutely LOVE IT!!!!
Here is why! I made the flour recipe that this book refers to as the ATK flour throughout their recipes. Found all the ingredients in my local Stop & Shop. I was having company this weekend and made the lemon tart recipe. While it did take me 3 hours to make; it was so delicious and I got such rave reviews, I would certainly make it again! I also made the cornbread which did not use flour, only cornmeal, and is baked in a skillet! My son who only liked this one recipe I previously made using flour, loved this and kept eating more and more; even after our company was gone. So I am so ecstatic about these books!!! I can't wait to try more recipes! I'm also happy that I know I can make gluten free recipes for my friends that are so delicious that they won't even know they're gluten free!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"I have read and used several gluten-free cookbooks over the last 6 years, but this is the best one I've come across, because it goes into such detail about what things work (or don't work) to increase the taste appeal of gluten-free cooking. They can do this because they develop the recipes in test kitchens, and tell you what happened when they used particular ingredients. For example, that's how they learned that melted and cooled butter works better than oil in many cases. This kind of information helps you to improve other recipes on your own. They go on to detail their step-by-step directions, which makes it useful for the beginner, but also give the reasons behind their choices of specific ingredients, so you can start to experiment on your own. Another useful thing is their evaluations of alternate flours by brand names, most often Bob's Red Mill and King Arthur. If you can have only one gluten-free cookbook on your shelf, this is the one I'd recommend."
2,"I have tried the pizza recipe which is fantastic cause it makes 2 crusts which you can freeze and later have fresh pizza in 10 min! Also the biscuits, which as a southerner are near and dear to my heart. They are very good, but they do have a lemony taste due to the lemon juice. The chocolate chip cookies are the best you will ever eat! This book is AWESOME!!! I also love how they explain how they came up with the recipe the way it is and why you do need certain odd ingredients (like psyllium husk powder) just in case you think you can leave it out. DON'T!! These people know what they are doing! I have book 2 also and it is even more fabulous with a true whole grain bread! Buy both! I'm glad did!"
2,"Made several recipes so far from the bread, cake and cookies sections from both volume 1 and 2. I haven't made many recipes from the main meals sections since I bought them specifically for the baked goods recipes. The all time favorites among both gluten and gluten free guests have been the gingerbread cookies and the gingerbread cake. I've also made the oatmeal raisin cookies, blueberry and pumpkin pies, and from volume 2 the whole grain sandwich bread, whole-grain blueberry muffins and the New York style Crumb Cake. I like that the recipes have been tested and always come out great when the directions are followed.Of course, all grains including whole- grain gluten free ones are high in carbs, so these are mostly special occasion recipes - glad ATK did the research!!"
2,"My allergist considers wheat to be the root of all evil! He has been pushing gluten free for quite some time and I reluctantly agreed to give it a go. My problem with going gluten free was that I like things like muffins and cookies. I had tried some store bought gluten free products. They were awful. I think the packaging might have had more flavor. I have also tried some cookies made by a friend who pulled the recipes off the internet. Yuck! So, when I saw this cookbook I was hopeful that gluten free might be bearable. I was wrong, using these recipes is going to make gluten free much, much better than just bearable! I've tried three of the cookie recipes so far and each one is excellent. I actually liked them much better than my traditional wheat flour recipes.

One of the reviews that I read before purchasing this cookbook was critical of the book because it uses dairy. This is an unfair criticism because the book doesn't make any claim to presenting dairy free recipes. If you need dairy free you'll probably want to buy something different. If you are looking for good tasting gluten free recipes this book is wonderful.

I've read that the Test Kitchens are working on another gluten free cookbook. I can't wait!"
2,"There are SO many cookbooks out there with gluten-free recipes, but most of them include a lot of recipes for food that is naturally gluten free anyway. I suppose that's good for people who aren't sure about what's what and want a book to guide them.

But I was looking for something that specially addressed the challenges of making recipes gluten-free. And of course it was the folks from America's Test kitchen who did it!

So far everything I've cooked from it has been spot on, and I've learned a lot about how gluten-free recipes, especially for things that normally require flour (pizza dough, cakes) can be altered to be gluten-free, and been introduced to new ingredients (e.g., psyllium husk, xanthan gum) that I've never used before, but that make all the difference. And the beauty of this cookbook, like most from ATK, is that they explain WHY they use the ingredients (in a must-read section in the front of the book). And there many other pearls of wisdom sprinkled throughout the book that are well worth reading.

Layout is terrific. Nice large photos of every recipe. Lots of how-to sidebars.

All in all, this book is worth every penny. Anyone cooking for someone who can't have gluten should buy this book--you can make things that everyone can eat, and without spending a fortune! And, you can also make some of the recipes without using gluten-free ingredients like pasta for a more general audience, fore example, pasta recipes. The recipe for spaghetti with Puttanesca Sauce is a favorite--just use the appropriate pasta depending on you're cooking for."
2,"Finally, good biscuits! Lining in the south, biscuits and gravy were an occasional breakfast treat for my husband and myself. Alas, when we eliminated gluten from our diet, we really missed biscuits. My attempts ranged from heavy to crumbly w no resemblance to a real biscuit. The test kitchen biscuit recipe produces the closest thing to a wheat biscuit that I've eaten. The sandwich bread is also a winner, although I add some flax and millet. I just tried the pizza crust and we loved it. They have already made the failures and I can use their tips for other gf recipes. My only regret is that I didn't buy this book sooner."
2,"I've been a fan of the America's Test Kitchen for over a decade. I've always loved how they get into the science behind their cooking and explain why recipes work. Even so, I've never bought a cookbook from them--been tempted in the past, but haven't done it. Until now. After previewing this cookbook from my library, I knew I'd have to have it since I went gluten-free last year. I'm a baker at heart, and have missed making breads and goodies that I can partake in--or even simple things that suddenly became more complicated like fried chicken.

So far, I've actually tried three of the recipes--the chocolate chip cookies, the crispy chicken strips, and the fudgy brownies. All are superb. The flavor is great, and they generally have the look, feel, and taste of their non-GF counterparts. I'm very pleased. I'm excited to try more of the recipes out of this cookbook as I'm able. Up next will probably be their sandwich bread. As much as I like Udi's (who they recommend highly), nothing beats homemade bread. If you're new to the GF lifestyle, this cookbook is a must-have. But be sure you follow their guidelines to a T. Read the hints and tips, and the story behind the final product of the recipes. They'll save you heartache--or just gritty cookies."
2,"Several years ago when we first started eating Gluten Free I purchased many, many books to learn from. This book is worth it's weight in gold. Out of all the books I purchased, this book and Gluten Free for Dummies have been the most valuable. My go to books for answers to questions and information about grain properties. We have many favorites that started from this book. We have altered recipes for taste, cooking conditions, nutrition and grain prices. We were also able to recreate some of our favorites that are now Gluten Free using this book. The layout and organization of information makes this a great reference guide to keep close at hand. The two books I mentioned earlier were a good combination for allowing me to make substitutions. I will be buying book two in the near future."
2,"When I first found out that I was Celiac I wasn't sure how I was going to get back into baking. I tried many recipes from the internet before I finally ventured into buying GF cookbooks and this one is one of the best I've purchased.

The pancakes, waffles, cookies, cakes... my husband couldn't tell any of them were gluten free. It's nice to be able to dip back into some of the old my favorite foods from when I was a kid and not have it taste like bark.

One of the best features of the book, as with any ATK publication, is the extensive research that they share as to WHY things work one way and not another. It's very helpful to have such a resource when you feel like you're starting from square one again."
2,"I am interested in eating less gluten. I'm a mom and wife, and I since I'm the chief food preparer in the house, I can't change my diet without dragging the whole family along. And they won't be dragged anywhere where there are no breads or cookies or other tasty baked goods.

Let's get this straight: there are no good GF baked products. Sandwich bread is yucky, I don't care what cool health food store you buy it from. Cookies are gritty. Cakes are bland. A noted exception is Trader Joe's GF chocolate cupcakes and lemon cookies, but even then, they're expensive. ALL GF products are expensive, which hack me off. That's one of the things that adds to the obesity epidemic is that good food, healthy food, is always more expensive.

So knowing ATK's methods for developing recipes (testing a billion different batches, different ways, until they're RIGHT) I expected this cookbook to be different. And is it ever. It begins, as ATK is want to do, with simple, scientific explanations of the chemistry of GF foods and the challenges i working with GF ingredients. I trust that they have looked at every angle. I know they've done their homework so I don't have to.

The first recipe I tried, simply because I had over ripe bananas on the counter, was the Banana Bread recipe. They have a GF flour mixture recipe that they recommend, and it is the closest thing I have found to the ""real thing."" The bread was unbelievably delicious! No flavoring or spices in it except bananas (they pack five of them in there!), it was moist, the crumb held together well, there was no aftertaste of non-wheat floury things, and it wasn't gummy or sticky, like a lot of things made with rice flour are.

If the rest of the recipes in here are this good, I am hooked. I will be able to offer my family GF dishes that they'll eat, and not whine about. That's worth ever penny!"
2,"I have picky eaters in my house and most of them don't like gluten free. I refuse to bake things with gluten since I can't eat it, so most of the time the gluten free treats I make go uneaten. Not so with the recipes in this book! My favorite so far is the Lemon Pound Cake. I've been enticed by the thick slices that I see at Starbucks, but I know they are not gluten free and they charge an arm and a leg. This gluten free version turned out almost perfect! The only thing I would change is add more lemon zest or maybe a teaspoon of lemon extract. The recipes are easy to follow, the ingredients not exotic stuff you have to hunt for or special order, and they really do turn out tasty. It has helped me make the occasional gluten free treat or bread for when I'm craving stuff I shouldn't have, and it tastes almost as good as glutenated baked goods. Seriously I didn't miss gluten at all in that pound cake and it was better than my old gluten filled recipe!! I can't wait to try more of the recipes like the gluten free pasta! This Italian girl misses her fresh pasta and ravioli!

Update: Made the Cheese Bread today and OMG yum! This would go great with chili or hearty soup."
2,"So far I've baked Chocolate Layer Cake and brownies, with mixed results; and the Hearty Country Flax Bread which I will definitely make again. Both desserts were made the same day as a recipe from the book ""Gluten-Free Baking"" by the Culinary Institute of America and box mixes from King Arthur and Hodgson Mill. The best feature in this cookbook is only having to mix one flour mixture, and in many of the recipes it tells you how to substitute Bob Mills & King Arthur boxed flour mixtures, as well as giving you their test results using these substitutions.

Brownies: The recipe in this book came in second to the Culinary Institute of Amc. recipe. I didn't like the texture (kind of gummy or very fudgy) or dense chocolate flavor that just didn't seem balanced. The recipe from the Culinary Institute held together, had an excellent flavor and texture, and didn't gum up ('too fudgey""), this was a really great brownie. The box mixes were both so bad, there is no comparison.

Chocolate Cake: I repeated efforts with the Chocolate Layer Cake (which makes two 9 inch cakes); comparing it with the Devils food cake recipe from the Culinary Institute (cake size is 6 inches-what's up with that?), and box mixes again from King Arthur and Hodgson Mill. First place was the Chocolate Layer Cake in America's Test Kitchen!. Truly a delicious cake with great texture (it was far superior than all the other cakes). 2nd place was a mix by King Arthur (with frosting this would be an acceptable option (King Arthur Gluten Free Chocolate Cake Mix, 22 Oz)). 3rd place was the recipe from the Culinary Institute, which wasn't horrible, but not near as good as the 1st place or the King Arthur box mix. Hodgson Mil mix had buttermilk added to an already off smelling, kinda sour & bitter) mix. Not even in the game at this point.

For years my go to cookbook has been from Americas Test Kitchen, so I was surprised with the brownie results, but with the cake ""comeback"" I am ready to try more recipes and feel the book has been educational and a great addition to my cookbook library."
2,"When I found out I had celiac's, I knew I had to see if ATK had a GF cookbook. I have 2 of their other cookbooks, and knew if it existed, theirs would be the one to get. I was so excited to see one had just been released this spring. They are picky, persnickety cooks who want their recipes to taste like food, not gluten free rubber. If you do what they tell you, you will not be disappointed. My 5 yr was thrilled to have pancakes, and my husband was thrilled that they TASTED like real pancakes.

Food/Product reviews are given as well as their own blend for GF all purpose flour to make over your old recipes. I
love that they give the reasoning and science behind their ingredient choices to help you troubleshoot if you run into a snag."
2,"I love baking and cooking, and my partner was recently diagnosed with celiac disease. Like others, I tried lots of disappointing online recipes. Our beloved Friday night pizzas were now destined to be cardboard disappointments. Enter this cookbook - The pizza crust recipe is amazing, time consuming, but amazing. Waffles, pizza - itâ€™s a whole new world of gluten free favorites. Iâ€™m so happy!!!"
2,"This is one of the easiest cookbooks to understand that I've ever used. It has some really great recipes, but beyond that, they explain why they work. This is important because if I don't have something in the recipe, I can make an educated guess about a substitution. The pictures are wonderful, the directions simple and I'm very glad I got it and have it on my shelf - I just need more time to be able to make more recipes!"
2,"This is by far the best Gluten Free cookbook I have ever used. If you are a fan of America's Test Kitchen, then you know how meticulous they are when testing recipes and coming up with solutions to cooking problems. Gluten free baking has all kinds of problems and they really have solved them. My family has loved every single one of the recipes I have made from this book, and when I bake for guests they have no idea that they are eating something without gluten."
2,"We do not have a health requirement for us to eat gluten free. I was curious about how gluten-free would taste. In general, I found I prefer gluten (flour), especially for bread items. But they tell you all about how to mix the gluten-free flour. Also give recommendations on what brands to buy. My wife says that I got my money's worth with the the Granola recipe, we made it frequently and it tastes great. We even do some substitutions with almond flour for the coconut since our daughter is not crazy about coconut. Getting back to the book, this chapter must be READ before starting the recipes:

The Basics of Gluten-Free Cooking - 31 pages

It will give you the Test Kitchen Gluten-Free flour blend requiring white rice flour, brown rice flour, and a few other ingredients. Also gives the Test Kitchen explanation on how things work (I love that). This book was great if you want to learn how to cook gluten free."
2,"I have always loved bread of all kinds and I missed it so much. There are recipes online, yes, but all of those I tried were a big FAIL for me. The all purpose flour mix and sandwich bread recipe in this cookbook are just what I had been searching for. The bread looks, smells and tastes fantastic, just like ""real"" bread. Being that good does pose a problem though; how to stop myself from overindulging!

Baking bread is the reason I purchased the book but it has given me so much more. There are recipes for birthday cake, pie crust, pizza, biscuits, coatings for fried foods....etc. Their tips and tricks for improving the outcome of the recipes are invaluable.

I appreciate that the authors explain not just HOW to make the recipes but WHY the recipes work. The science involved in testing and perfecting them is fascinating."
2,"I was SO glad to find this cookbook. Prior to this one, all the gluten free cookbooks I'd tried used exotic flours, not readily available locally. The all purpose flour replacement in this cookbook is nearly perfect. I used to use a commercially available gluten free all purposes flour, in part because of the convenience of it. After using ATK's blend, I'll only use commercial blends as a last resort. The results are well worth the time needed to mix the flour blend. Thank you, ATK!"
2,"If you have to do without gluten, this cookbook is a must have. I made homemade pizza for the first time in 20 years. It tasted like the real deal!!! It has very good sections on baking and pasta dishes. With about a third of the book on product reviews and how to cook without gluten. There is now a second edition that I am planning to buy! ....the only drawback is that the baked goods are extremely rich. (high in cholestrol). For me, that's a minor issue. The web has countless recipes that are healthy, for comparision. This cookbook tells you how to make cookies that don't flatten out all over the cookie sheet! How to make piecrust that tastes like piecrust. Be prepared to buy numerous additives to assure success, but it is soooooo worth it!"
2,"Once again America's test kitchen provides lots of interesting science about cooking. Now they give their treatment to gluten free cooking. This is new territory and there's not much in the way of edible gluten free food in the supermarkets, although this is changing really fast. In fact, I had written a comment to the editors over a year ago hoping they would jump into the gluten free industry but they declined saying it was a niche (or something like that. At least he wrote back).
Now the big food factories are getting into the gluten free sector so it's trending mainstream now.

I really like the explanations. My wife and kids are celiacs and we are always challenged getting bread that seems close to the real gluten based product. This book goes a long way to providing recipes and better, explaining why those recipes work. Working without gluten is a challenge and it's really helpful to have these folks at your side.

As they say, Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."
2,"Recipes work. I also bought the second cookbook after using the first. The recipes seem to have a slightly better flavor and turn out better in terms of dough rise, etc. I use the ATK general purpose flour formation found within this book as a general purpose flour for recipes found in other cookbooks and have had good results. I like the way ATK discusses why a recipe works and why they don't recommend certain ingredients."
2,"I absolutely love this cookbook!! The recipes are amazing--I really like their gluten-free flour mix (although it does work best with the ATK recipes--and not as well with other recipes). The Classic Sandwich Bread recipe is the best g-f bread I have ever made--as well as their Piecrust, Sweet Biscuits and Pumpkin Bread. The Meatloaf and Eggplant Parmesan recipes were also amazing!! Oh--and their Blueberry Muffins--wonderful! I also appreciate their explanations as to why the particular recipe ""works"". I'm looking forward to the second cookbook which is to be released in October. :-)"
2,"I got this as a gift for my Mom, who had to go gluten free. She is raving about this cookbook and informative scientific test book! She loves learning, and at 82, enjoys knowing just why some things work in a recipe and some things fail miserably. America's Test Kitchen teaches her those lessons. The recipes range from very, very good to superb. My Dad even likes them, knowing they are gluten-free. That's quite an accomplishment!
Recipes include a gluten-free flour blend that is guaranteed to perform as expected. Two other ready-made blends are recommended, but they are not guaranteed. Mom assures me that everything she has baked has turned out beautifully, from savory quinoa cakes, to pancakes, pie crusts, and biscuits. She's only had the cookbook a short while, but is planning on using it extensively."
2,I have tried several recipes and so far I have had a lot of luck. They are better than any other gluten-free recipes I have tried and I have been experimenting for a while. I would have given it 5 stars but for the fact that they use a lot of dairy which I can't have either. I have tried the recipes without them and they have come out very well. I omitted the dried milk powder in the flour mix. I have also substituted rice milk and lemon jiuce for yogurt and for buttermilk and it worked great! Very anxious to try more recipies. I love that they explain the science involved and why things work. Makes it much easier to make substitutions. Great book!
2,"In 2005, I sent an e-mail to the folks at Cooks Illustrated asking them to do some work on bread for Celiacs. Back then, bread was pretty bad for those of us who needed to eat gluten-free. The best recipes used bean flour, which had an off-taste. I had been a big fan of the Cook's Illustrated magazine and knew that if these food scientists put their minds to it, they could come up with fantastic recipes. They politely told me to stick it, as they did work on recipes for people on special diets. I wish they would have listened back then, because if they had, the past nine years would have been a lot better for the millions of us who can't ingest gluten. This book is fantastic. Their pizza dough recipe, for example, tops all. The crust has body and texture and is chewy. Their addition of ingredients like psyllium husk and dried milk powder to the standard flour blends, for scientific reasons, makes a huge difference in body and mouth-feel. This book sets the new standard for gluten-free cookbooks. It's a must-have for anyone with Celiac Disease."
2,"I have only had this cookbook a few months, and have tried a couple recipes. I love reading their tests and the science behind everything! I made their flour blend, which comes out being cheaper than other name brands, for example, theirs comes out about $16 for 5 lbs., vs. that price for 3 lbs. on another brand. I then used it for my usual biscuit recipe, which I have made very nice biscuits with another brand of gluten-free flour before. Well, they did not rise as well, nor brown as well, but they did taste more like a wheat biscuit, and were not at all gritty! But, not flaky. I will have to try the biscuit recipe in the book, but it has several more ingredients.
I LOVED the Coffee Cake recipe (page 56), however! So did the ladies at the meeting I took it too, and unlike it says in the book, it IS still good the next day! It is not as rich and moist as coffee cakes I am used to, but the flavor is amazing, it looks gorgeous, and the crumb is very tender. The topping alone is divine!
Cannot wait to try more recipes!"
2,"My wife is gluten free celiac, and I am now her baker. This book has fabulous tasting gluten free bread and dinners we both can eat and enjoy while keeping our home completely gluten free. I had hoped for years that America's Test Kitchen would do a gluten free book, always believing they would get it right. They got it perfect. We freeze two slices of bread in wax paper and store the entire loaf thus prepared in Jumbo Ziplock Bags. I currently have pizza crusts, cinnamon raisin bread, multi grain bread, and English Muffins in the Freezer. Their Mac and Cheese Casserole recipe has had everyone attending our barbeques requesting the recipe. We have made no unsuccessful recipes from this book to date. It has made our lives so much more tasteful. Thank you ATK."
2,"This book is fantastic. I use it all the time, especially for pie crust, lemon bars, biscuits, and brownies. Even though, they recommend making their own recipe for GF flour mix, I actually use either Pamela's Artisan Gluten Free All Purpose Flour (sold many places, including Whole Foods) or the flour sold online by Simply Gluten Free, and I get great results. (https://simplygluten-free.com/carols-all-purpose-flour)"
2,"I was just diagnosed with Celiac disease about two months ago. When I first got the news I really struggled with it, but the recipes in this cook book made things so much easier. They did a great job explaining gluten free baking and cooking, how it works, the chemistry, and it had great food reviews in there. I think this is a must have for anyone that wants to go gluten free, anyone who's got Celiac, or anyone who is gluten sensitive."
2,"I am convinced their test-kitchen have broken thru the mystery of gluten-free baking. What a difference after years of eating cardboard cakes, pastries...and particularly sad bread. This cookbook is a the secret to good baking...after years of eating bland, and a half-dozen or more other cookbooks whose authors don't have a clue this is the break thru."
2,I now have both of the How Can it be Gluten Free cookbooks from America's Test Kitchen. After reading the second book I went back and purchased this one. I am so pleased with every recipe that I have tried. After being diagnosed with Celiac disease I needed to relearn everything I knew about cooking and baking. These books were the answer.
2,"I cannot state enough how much I have appreciated this book and the second volume. I've been baking gf for 7 years now and this book has taught me so much I didn't know within the past few months. It's amazing having recipes turn out perfectly each time because they are proven to work, you aren't just taking a chance on someone's recipe from a blog like I normally did. I recommend owning both volumes in your house as a staple cookbook."
2,"I am brand new into gluten free baking and after many gummy, gooey, less than desirable attempts of baking and trying different online recipes I was ready to give up! Until, I literally stumbled on a NPR transcript interviewing this book. I tried the pancakes recipe and followed the recipe exactly along with the hints and they turned out sooooo great! Not one was gummy,gooey and they tasted great!!!! You must follow the preheating skillet hint in the book! I am looking forward to making the biscuits on page 193...the idea of being able to have them again and taste great is awesome!!"
2,"This book is so good! I love that it explains why their recipes work, and why certain ingredients make gluten free baking different than baking with wheat and other glutinous grains. It has helped me understand beyond the recipes in the book, because the book teaches techniques, not just recipes! Be adventurous, and control what is in your food!"
2,"I love to cook, and my husband and I have been fans of ALL the America's Test Kitchen cookbooks. I have been gluten free for more than ten years, so when this cookbook came out, it was a no brainer for me to purchase. What I love about America's Test Kitchen is that they explain to you WHY certain ingredients or methods work, and why others will not work. But, I must say, I appreciate it even more with the gluten free cookbook. Gluten free baking is still confusing to me, and now I understand why. It is so different, but now I have explanations as to why certain ingredients will work and others won't work in gluten free. Even better, I have discovered ingredients to use for gluten free baking that I have NEVER thought of before. I love this cook book and will most likely be packing away all of my other gluten free cookbooks now that I have this one."
2,Excellent book ...anything from America's test kitchen is exceptional in flavor and this book delivers also. The Chrispy Chicken Fingers recipe is worth the price of the book IMO. Eating Gluten-free requires that you change the way you cook and so many recipes are complete disasters....I have yet to cook anything from the pages of any book from America's test kitchen that was not delicious. Get it ...you will not be disappointed.
2,"Great book for people who can't have gluten. This book explains what gluten is and the science behind it. It reviews many gluten free products and flour and recommends the products that work the best. I love that each recipe has ""Why this recipe works"" It explains the science behind it. With gluten free, apparently, it is very important how you add ingredients to make sure the recipe comes out correctly. This book explains it all. I have only made a few things, but they have come out tasting like normal items, not dry tasteless gluten free things. Thumbs up for this book."
2,"I purchased this book one year after my husband was diagnosed with Celiacs Disease. I used to love to bake but now that he can't have gluten and we don't keep it in the house, I have only used boxed gluten free baking mixes. Intimidated by gluten free baking maybe. I was eager to get back into baking with this book. I studied the information in it about the flours and what they did for each recipe; the chemistry of them. I learned a lot. I even bought all the flours and made the ATK flour recommended in all of the recipes, using a digital scale to ensure exact measurements. For my first recipe I tried the multigrain sandwich bread. It was not good. Poor texture (dense and grainy) and very bean flavored. The book recommends using Bob's Red Mill brand in its own mix, but then says that using Bob's Red Mill all purpose will leave a bean flavor. Well I don't understand what is so different, since both are Bob's Red Mill. On to the next, I figured maybe it was just that bread and I tried the Cinnamon Raisin bread. At first I thought this was not sweet enough. I tried eating it toasted and then also grilled, Then I added cinnamon sugar and then tried it with a powdered sugar glaze. I think the glaze really helped make it feel like a cinnamon bread I was used to. I should mention that both recommended cook times were off, at least by half hour. I know all ovens vary, but half hour is a lot of time. I'm glad that I checked them and pulled them out early or they would've overcooked. I know that all my variables were correct, proper mixings, proper temperature of water for yeast, let it rise properly, used the recommended pan size.So make sure to keep an eye on them."
2,"A must have if you or a family member has celiac disease. ATK has always been a family go to for recipes, and their gluten free recipes are just as good as their regular recipes. They do a great job of explaining why the gluten recipe works the way it does and how they then duplicate those results with a gluten free recipe. They do a super job of explaining how to approach gluten free cooking vs. non-gluten free cooking."
2,"I'm converted - this beats that old ""gluten-free bible"" rag. ATK out-did themselves with The How Can It Be Gluten Free Cookbook (and they are coming out with a sequel, my dears). This makes ""gluten-free"" taste GOOD and now I can eat breads, cakes, pancakes and pasta again, even given my GI issues. Buying gluten-free products at the stores can be expensive, so go ahead and make it yourself! The little bit of work is worth the effort to get back all the flavor and mouth-feel in your meals. THANK YOU, ATK CHEFS!"
2,"America's Test Kitchen did it again, they have tested and written the ultimate gluten free cookbook. If you follow their recipes everything turns out perfect and is delicious. You will not miss wheat flour products."
2,"America's Test Kitchen lives up to their name. They test all the recipies as well as store bought alternatives and alternative ingreidiants. I have heard interviews with members of The Test Kitchen over the years but this is the first time I bought one of their books. In the interview the authors said their recipie would make a good biscuit. All my previous attempts turned out like greasy rubber. Thanks for the great biscuits. I can also vouche for the sandwich bread and the flourless chocolate cake.

These recipes do take time to make with multiple ingredients and steps but the reasons are explained behind these procedures and the results are as promised. You can serve these to anyone on a gluten free diet as well as family or company. You will not have to suffer through eating an inferior gluten free choice while everyone else eats the good food.

I can't wait to try the pasts. I have to dig out the pasta machine and dust it off first.

Thank you America's Test Kitchen."
2,"I purchased this book just last week and made the lemon pound cake recipe and the gluten free bread. My husband has Celiac Disease and finding good bread is a huge challenge. We make our own GF bread because the commercially produced bread is horrible (and we've tried everything out there, believe me). We have several recipes for gluten free bread but the issue always ends up being that ""gluten free"" taste that you get from using xanthan gum. However, the recipe in this book uses psyllium husk instead and there is no nasty gluten free taste. The bread was amazing! The cake was awesome too!! We had dinner guests and no one could tell it was a gluten free cake.

I usually don't post a lot of reviews, but I do like to read customer reviews prior to buying something. I noticed that most reviews for this book were very positive, but like with anything, there were a couple of negative ones. I had to read them just to see what people disliked. I find it really annoying that people who gave this book poor reviews did so because they didn't think the book was ""healthy"" enough. This is not a diabetic or low carb cookbook. I hate when people skew reviews because of this. People should be reviewing the recipes and giving their opinions on those. As I said in a previous comment, I have several cookbooks that have their share of healthy recipes along with sections on ""treats"" such as cakes and pies. People need to use common sense. You wouldn't condemn the Better Homes & Gardens or Betty Crocker cookbook because of the dessert section, would you? Yes, if you eat pie and cake everyday you are not going to be healthy.

In my opinion, the recipes we've made so far are great and we look forward to trying out more of them."
2,"I have had this book a short time and tried two recipes with great success. The Tamale Pie was outstanding and easy to tweak if you like it a little more spicy ... and we do. Ditto, the Lemon Pound Cake was fabulous. Yes, I had to stock my pantry with lots of never-before needed staples that are a must and found many on Amazon at a decent price ... the rest at my local health food store. We do not have to eat gluten-free but I have found that the less wheat I consume, the better I feel. We have a few friends who do have gluten issues, so it's really nice to be able to cook something they can enjoy when they visit. AMK has done it again. Recipes you can trust!"
2,"This book is excellent for people who have no choice in being gluten free. Some people are not gluten free because its a lifestyle choice. Not everyone is on a diet. This book is way more than just a cook book. It is very informative and a great foundation for someone who is looking to learn to be and to cook gluten free. There are plenty of cookbooks out there for the people who are gluten free out of vanity instead of necessity. It is nearly impossible to find gluten free recipes that are not also no sugar, low calorie, or vegan also. This book makes it a little easier."
2,"I've cooked so many recipes from this book, and every single one has turned out beautifully. (That never happens for me, so I'd say it's far more a testament to the book than to my abilities as a cook/baker!) The directions can be picky/particular, but are worth following in-full at least once or twice (the results should be excellent) before starting to tweak/find shortcuts. For a science-minded cook/baker like myself, the thorough explanations are helpful and handy!"
2,"Many of us have tried gluten free baking, and what we usually get is something ""almost as good as"" the most average gluten-filled recipe. The chefs at America's Test Kitchen stake their reputation of providing the very best information to cook five-star-rated recipes. They have gone all out in this book to not just remove gluten but to develop recipes that make you forget eating gluten-laden foods. This book is a must-have for anyone who wants to add gluten-free to their repertoire of great dishes."
2,"ATK doesn't pretend to try to be everything to everyone. They state right out front that this book was exploring the gluten-free issue only. When you approach the book with that view in mind, you will find a highly useful book. This isn't vegan, paleo, or lactose or egg free. Don't expect that. They recognize people with Celiacs are often lactose intolerant and they do make some suggestions in that area.

This book teaches you why things work and why things don't. It gives you basic recipes to get started while teaching you how to develop your own. Bravo ATK!"
2,"My sister and her children and grandchildren all have celiac disease and I sometimes struggle to prepare tasty gluten free options. This book presents an easy to prepare baking mix that I used to make an almond cake (recipe also in the cookbook). It was gorgeous. Great taste and not at all similar to what is often not very good when baking gluten free. This book is not just a baking cookbook but that is what I will use it for mostly. I like, as found in other America's Test Kitchen books, that explanations are provided for how they tested each recipe and reached the final formula, along with giving optional ingredients that may not be quite as successful, and a discussion of why."
2,"Read this at my library and knew I needed one of our own. With 2 Celiacs at home, and the high cost of GF foods, we are always looking to save pennies. I liked that this cookbook not only truly tested the recipes and showed the difference of several items with different flours, but it gave you helpful hints (ie, when you make muffins you need to OVERMIX, not the traditional undermix, to have them turn out). Mine copy is currently being borrowed by a friend .... I have MULTIPLE gluten free cookbooks, but THIS is the one I recommend. The ONLY one I recommend."
2,"Anything done by Americaâ€™s Test Kitchen is great. This is a wonderful tool for anyone new to Gluten free eating. It gave me all the information needed (+) to make the diet change, The recipes are a huge bonus and well researched."
2,I am so very impressed with this book! ATK spent 2 months just researching the perfect flour blend. I made the tollhouse cookies and they are way better than any standard cookie I've ever made. Excited to try the rest of their recipes.
2,"I bought this cookbook hoping for recipes for ""normal"" food. The 1st 30 pages are devoted to discussing gluten-free products and how ATK rated them, staples, and cooking techniques. Lucky page 13 just might change your life; this is where I found the recipe for ATK gluten free flour blend. The ingredients were straight forward and easily found in my small town in rural western NY. Armed with ambition, I undertook my first recipe: chocolate chip cookies, an American staple. The ingredients were all standard items found in your average kitchen and used the ATK gluten-free flour blend. The only change I made was I didn't line my cookie sheets with parchment paper. The finished product looked good, smelled good, and tasted phenomenal! The only problem is Americas Test Kitchen recommends that the cookies are consumed on the same day that they are made - if you say so! Pizza crust and pie dough are next on the list."
2,"America's Test Kitchen brings out the science and dishes up some innovative tips, tricks, and recipes for reliable and tasty gluten-free cooking. I watch ATK on PBS and get the magazine, so I expected to be impressed... and was totally not disappointed.

The product reviews alone (comparing store-bought GF pasta, bread, etc.) are fantastic. But the mini science lessons about WHY certain ingredients mimic this or that gluten-y quality are invaluable because they empower the home cook to make smart substitutions in the their own recipes. I feel much more confident about going rogue with my own gluten free science experiments now. (MWAHAHAHAHA!!)"
2,"I love ATK and even better they have made a wonderful gf cookbook. So far I have made the sandwich bread (good first run. need more practice), eggplant parm (very good flavor and texture), pizza crust (best gf crust ever), fresh pasta (yay for gf ravioli. Also easier to make than regular fresh pasta), and Brazilian cheese rolls (best item that I've made from the book. I had no idea that they are regularly gf). I really like the recommendations on flours and their storage. Also it is pretty neat that most of the recipes have notes on what was found when they used The King Arthur and Bob's Redmill flour blends instead of the ATK blends. The only reason for one less star than perfect is that the binding on the book is low quality. After about 3 weeks of ownership and six recipes used the book is falling apart."
2,"I love this book. I am a home baker (pretty good in my own opinion), but I have never been very successful with GF baking. Since my husband prefers to be GF, I desire to make things he can eat.

The Buttermilk Waffles and Pancakes are fabulous (I started using dry buttermilk powder).
The Pizza Crust was very nice.
I was not successful with the the Sandwich Bread, but breads have always been difficult for me.
The Applesauce Snack Cake was easy and fun to have around, tasty, not too sweet, etc.
The Brazillian Cheese Rolls are a favorite, super easy and variable.

My husband is a happy camper."
2,"If you are serious about GF baking, then this book is a must have! ATF details the chemistry behind the baking, which finally answers many of the questions I had about why things didn't turn out quite right. I'm in the process of buying the additional ingredients necessary to make their recommended flour mix and start with the recipes in the book. However, I also feel armed to modify the recipes I already had to make them better. As a bonus, ATF also rates store-brand flour, bread and pasta products to help you with shortcuts.

The only downside of this book was the 6pt font--hard on my aging eyes.

Thank you ATF!!!!"
2,"I love this book because it explains step by step process in making the different recipes and also gives valuable insight about the things they had to change vs traditional flour recipes. The most commons treats that you can find in any bakery are here. You can really taste no difference between traditional baked goods and the gluten-free replacements.

Just a piece of advise: gluten-free does not mean fat free nor sugar free.

I'm looking forward to try the second book's recipes that I've already ordered."
2,"My husband has fallen in love with the Brioche bread I make with the recipe from this cookbook. High quality cookbook with a lot of delicious recipes for me to make for my husband, who has Celiacs."
2,"Great information for eating GF and various new techniques to adapt your recipes for it. Have used multie recipes already, and my husband, who doesnt have to eat GF, even loves them. The red velvet cupcakes were a huge hit for his bday."
2,"Having been gluten free for almost 5 years I have tried many cookbooks, many recipes, and created my own. I feel like I have enough background to fairly judge a recipe and or cookbook. This book is totally awesome from stem to stern! My family has many members that have gluten issues, sometimes we sit around and ponder what we would eat if we could and pie is one that is often mentioned. Good pie, pie with a flaky crust that isn't like a cracker. Well, folks this book will return pie to your life, pie crust that is unbelievably fantastic and amazingly easy to make!!! A pie that has a delicate touch, easy to slice and handles like a dream pie. This is the book.
Can't wait to try the english muffins."
2,"I like America's test kitchen, so I expected to like this. I am new to gluten free preparation, but right away found too much potato starch and flour used for my family who can't eat potatoes either.
But I did find one note as I broused through it: hydrate the batter before baking makes all the difference.
Since that seems to be such a big problem in gluten free baking, the tip is worth the price of the book.
I'll keep it and learn what else they discovered in their quest for perfection."
2,"Like 'Joy of Cooking"", this cookbook explains the hows and whys of Gluten-Free cooking. They did a years worth of research with cooks,scientists, and tasters to come up with what works. They have their recipes but because of the information they share about how they got their results, I hope to be able to convert my recipes as well. Super, Great Cook Book, thank you, thank you, America's Test Kitchen! This book will be on the shelf next to ""Joy"". Gluten Free manufacturer's take note: there is a way to get around that sandy gritty texture, and rock like mixes."
2,"I've had this book for at least 2 years and have made many of the baked goods in it. Baking gluten free had previously been tedious and disappointing. Over the years I have purchased many different types of flour for one awful recipie after another. I kept waiting for ATK to figure out gluten free for me and they did! The flour mix recipie is reliable and easy to make with just 5 ingredients. When I want to make something I just reach into the fridge and pull out the flour.

I have made dozens of the cupcakes for my sons' birthdays. They have always been a huge hit with the adults and kids alike. Delicious and decadent! Thank you for getting it right!!"
2,"This is an essential cookbook for anyone who is gluten-free and thought they'd never have a good slice of bread or pizza again. The recipes are easy to follow and the results are SO much better than any pre-made product you can find in the supermarket frozen foods section. By providing the science behind the recipe development, the editors also give you insight that can help in adapting other recipes. They also provide product reviews and recommendations for ingredients such as flour and pasta. Could not recommend this book more highly."
2,"I have been gluten free for over 15 years now, figuring out back then on my own that I had celiac. I have tried different baking flours and have come up with one for cookies and things like that-but I had given up on making good breads and pizza dough-this book is the best-explains why each recipe works, and what they did to get the recipe right-extremely happy with this book-definately met my expectations thank you americas test kitchen"
2,"Not only does this cookbook have some great gluten free recipes, it explains the science of gluten free baking, which I found helpful and very interesting."
2,I am not a wonderful cook. A cookbook must be very clear and easy for me to use. And then it needs to provide great results. This one delivers all points and then some. Almost every recipe my daughter and I have made together have proved to be BIG hits with the family. The food is delicious. The recipes are clear. I don't do any guessing...though sometimes I need to be better about reading the WHOLE recipe through at least once before I start so I don't jump to any incorrect conclusions on my part!! This is our FAVORITE cookbook in the kitchen now!
2,"We were trying to go gluten-free for my grandson who has ADHD. I'm trying to go gluten-less, mostly to eat fewer carbs. This is a terrific cookbook. The instructions are excellent. There is often an explanation of ""Why This Recipe Works"" which helps to explain the science of gluten-free cooking. The ingredients for the gluten-free flour are readily available. My only disappointment is that one must have a pretty hearty stand mixer to make the bread, and I can't afford the investment. Try the cornbread recipe. For me, it's better than anything with wheat flour."
2,"Definitely a good book to add to your gluten free library. Love the section giving advice on what brands to buy for the best taste & texture. It is very helpful. Just wish they had even more foods tested. Haven't tried their flour mixture yet, but I will be as soon as I buy some appropriately sized air-tight containers so I can organize my refrigerator and freezer to accommodate the extra flours.

I recommend this book to anyone who is setting up their gluten free kitchen, and to anyone who is considering starting a gluten free diet."
2,"I have only tried 4 recipes out of this book so far but they are all great! I tried the pizza crust - best gluten free pizza I have had except the one at Wolfgang Puck's Pizza bar but I don't live near one of those :( . The biscuit recipe is awesome!!!! You can tell they really put a lot of work into getting the recipes just right. If you are looking to cook gluten free and have it taste as good or, in most cases, better than it's gluten cousins - this is a must have."
2,"What an excellent cook book!! It has tips on how to cook everything gluten free, plus recipes. Like how to get a pie dough to turn out, or how to get a crumb topping to brown and stay crispy. They explain all the methods they tried, which ones failed and why, and which ones worked and why. It is a wealth of information for cooking gluten free foods! I am overjoyed that I found it! I also pre-ordered the next one coming out in September!"
2,"Before I had to eliminate gluten from my life, America's Test Kitchen cookbooks were some of my favorite resources because of their methodical approach to discovering the best version of each recipe.

This gluten-free-specific cookbook has been the answer to so many of the frustrations that I have experienced. The baked goods have texture that is as close to traditional baked goods as possible, and the taste is superb.

The instructions are clear, specific, and they offer advice for when you can ""cut corners"" and when to stay the course. It is my new go-to resource and my friends are extremely pleased that I'm working through all of the recipes, one by one.

I highly recommend this book for all levels of gluten free cooks. You will learn new tricks and discover new favorite recipes, I'm sure of it!"
2,"It's a dream come true.
No really.
Do you have celiac sprue or are you gluten sensitive? Do you find yourself avoiding analogues of glutenesque products because they taste like *?
This book will make you so happy. Your failed experiments in tortilla-making are OVER. Your family will no longer dread your inspired attempts to make cupcakes (Uh, no thanks, Dad! I'm GOOD!). Pie crusts will, in fact, bow to your new powers. Follow the recipes and don't mess around with them. You will NOT be disappointed.

Thank you America's Test Kitchen. Thank you."
2,"Excellent information that no other Gluten Free cookbook has provided. I have been cooking Gluten free for 3 years (Celiac's) and this is the first place that explains why gluten free baked goods are oily, how to make them rise better, improve texture, decrease grainy-ness. I love this cookbook. Its my go-to for baking. Finally a decent pound cake!! If your on a Gluten free diet you only need one cook book for baked goods, this is the best one I have found so far."
2,So many great recipes and tips for someone just starting out making GF foods. I love how they help you understand how the ingredients do what they do and offer substitutes. My sister has celiacs and bought this for her 1st. This book gives her so many options!
2,"Finally, a bread recipe for GF that is tasty, unlike the expensive ready-made loaves I've thrown away. I love the explanations of why the recipes work. A super cookbook for GF people. Highly recommended."
2,"Started dating a Celiac so all my old baking recipes went out the window. Not only does this book have great, well tested recipes, they also tell you what the philosophy behind the recipe was, what issues they ran into, and how they overcame those issues"
2,"This and Vol 2 are awesome books--- extremely helpful for those of us with celiac. While I saw one reviewer complain that other food allergens were not considered in the book, I want to thank ATK for focusing mainly on gluten. They made the right decision! I am soooo sick of tasteless, insipid production baked goods that exclude everything good like butter, nuts, etc on the premise that people have food allergies by the dozen (and it is sooo much cheaper to omit all the good stuff). People can take lactase for lactose intolerance and sub for other, far less common, food allergens but working around gluten is much more difficult and deserves pinpoint attention. After years of sampling flavorless cardboard baked goods, it is wonderful to have thoroughly tested recipes that actually produce good tasting foods. Thank you ATK!"
2,"I am referring to ""The How Can It Be Gluten Free Cookbook"" as a textbook, as it breaks with traditional GF cookbooks in several important areas. In the past dozen+ years my wife has been diagnosed w/Celiac disease, most of the quality publications have come from Canada and Europe where wheat allergies have been recognized both earlier and more extensively than here in the U.S. While most of the cookbooks have been able to prevent illness by delineating products containing allergens and stressing techniques to combat cross contamination, most of the difficult to replicate foods have had a distinct Sakrete overtone. This text, influenced by as many food scientists as any other publication I've encountered, relies on empirical data analysis sampled from considerably more varied food sources and combinations thereof. Up until this text was released, the closest thing I was able to do in preparing quality GF food was to stock dozens of Red Mill GF products (which are excellent and of extremely high quality) and try to build from their product line. ""The How Can It Be Gluten Free Cookbook"" explores the composition of many GF staples, gives the chemical wherewithal for their functionality, and provides guidance for their use and appropriate substitutions where plausable. The only drawback apparently is that some items specified for making up basic compounds such as a ATK baking mix requires some ingredients not found at your local supermarket, e.g. powdered psyllium seed (available online from Amazon, of course!). If you are not afraid of playing kitchen chemist (Alton Brown fans take note), this is the book for you...."
2,"I've been a fan of ATK for years. I have several of their other cookbooks.

This book has some great recipes, with clear instructions and detail about
their approach toward making Gluten free versions of American classics.

My only thing is that they could be a little more liberal with their use of
spices. Many of the recipes taste OK, but a little on the bland side. I've
learned to double the amount of spices they call for for certain dishes."
2,I bought this for my mom who is supposed to avoid gluten for her auto-immune disease. She loves this cookbook! It has enabled her to get back into cooking delicious meals but with the added bonus of staying gluten free!
2,"If you need to eliminate gluten from your diet or if you want to reduce it from what you eat, this is certainly an ultimate book on the subject. America's Test Kitchens does their usually wonderful job of being exact and explaining just how to cook gluten free. They give detailed explanations as well as the many photographs of the finished recipe using different commercial flours as well as the Test Kitchens own recipe for a gluten free flour. Baking is about science and this book shows you just how to accomplish it gluten free."
2,"I bought this book as a friend had it. It has some great, easy recipes to make anything gluten free. It also explains why things work certain ways and what commercial brands of flour mixes work well and why others do not."
2,"With three out of the five in our family recently diagnosed with celiac, this book has changed my life. Iâ€™m a baker, and these diagnosis have really turned my life around, but ATK walks you thru gf baking, and has their own tested all purpose flour mix. Let me tell you, its phenomenal. Canâ€™t even tell youâ€™re eating gf (which is only slightly terrifying!). Highly recommend!"
2,"This was the best gluten free cookbook I have purchased. I love how they explain why they mix the flour blends. The recipes are wonderful! Many dishes that I had previously made were converted in this cookbook to gluten free.
Also, there are many pictures with many of the recipes..always a plus. The bread recipe is the best one I have tried after at least seven other attempts. The bread has a soft texture and is not mealy like many I have tried. The price of the book was worth it for that recipe alone. Very glad I purchased it."
2,I'm a baker and have had a difficult time finding gluten free recipes that taste really good. This book has given me better insight into how gluten free baking works and I have used the ideas on other recipes or mixes and those ideas have made the food much more tolerable. Happy I purchased the book.
2,"After starting gluten free a few months ago, we searched all over online for GF recipes--most were not very good, lacked flavors. America's Test Kitchen, located near Boston, has teams of expert cooks who do recipe research and development and produce cook books as well as TV programs. This book is full of general information on gluten free cooking and the recipes consistently produce outstanding GF results. A MUST for going gluten free."
2,Tons of great recipes. I loved the options with flours. I would recommend having a scale if you don't already. I used another type of gf flour and measured it with the scale and it turned out great. The cookies were awesome and crunchy. I prefer some of these recipes to those with the gluten. To me that is a big deal.
2,Now this is the cook book I trust. The Editors of America's Test Kitchen have rarely failed to deliver. I bake and cook from 'Cook's Illustarted all the time and love knowing not only that I am making something delicious but also learning about the chemistry in why the recipe works. You get the same feed back in this book. I'm cooking things out of this book for my wife and love seeing the smile on her face while she's finally able to eat a pancake or something else from this wonderful cook book. Bravo America's Test Kitchen!
2,"We have always liked and respected the authors. We recently got the book, but we have not used the recipes yet as we are still in awe over the recipes we are using that came with our new Zojirushi BB-PAC20 that we have used to make absolutely amazing, delicious, gluten free breads."
2,"For those of us with Celiac this explains so well how to cook food and baked goods and have them turn out good. Have made so many bad dishes through the years and still have problems with my baking. I just wish they had gone with a gluten free, dairy free cook book. There is a lot of dairy so am altering recipes but I still love this cook book."
2,"A disclaimer to begin with. I bought this book as a gift for a family member, and I have never looked at it myself. I gave it a four-star rating based on books I have that are written by the America's Test Kitchen Team. They are great cookbooks, so interesting to read, because the scientific reasons for a technique or ingredient are explained in terms that are easily understood by average cooks. The explanations don't insult the intelligence of the reader, but they also don't talk over our heads. Their recipes usually turn out well the first time you make them."
2,"Bought this for my wife who loves to bake, but it of course is hard gluten free. The only comaint she has had is the number of recipes that call for the ready made all purpose flour. Sometimes she prefers to just use the boxed glutino all purpose flour."
2,"Nice book. Great info. Little tear in cover, but otherwise almost perfect. Worth while addition to my gluten free cook book collection!"
2,"So glad this book came out! My husband was diagnosed with celiacs 2 years ago, so I've been cooking/baking gluten-free for him since then. I love the narratives in ATK's other books/magazines and the explanations of why recipes work a certain way; I was very happy to see them produce a gluten free cookbook because I knew it would contain a wealth of information. I was not disappointed. A lot of their initial conclusions/recommendations lined up perfectly with what we've discovered through trial and error over the past years, which gives me great confidence in the rest of the book. It presents a fresh, analytical (but not clinical) approach to gluten free cooking that I find straightforward and appealing. I can't wait to try some of the bread recipes.

Thanks!"
2,"This book has become a main source for dinner ideas.

This is not a cookbook where someone just subs in gluten free flour and writes the book. I have read Cooks Illustrated for 20 years and I know the care that they put in to experimenting with every recipe until they get it right. We have not found one bad recipe yet.

Cheers for Cooks Illustrated!"
2,"Bought as a gift as it comes up frequently as an essential cookbook for GF kitchens. ATK is a trusted source and it was an easy decision to purchase. However, it's a bit dated as there are more recipes out there that do not include additives like xanthum gum, etc. But otherwise, excellent basic GF cookbook to include all categories but will need to supplement with other alternatives."
2,"Now I know why my gluten free baking had been so disappointing. Its not as simple as substituting GF flour for regular flour. This cookbook spells out how to get it right, and the science behind it. The recipes that I have tried so far have turned out perfect! The techniques spelled out in the book can be applied to your own favorite recipes as well. It covers not only baked goods, but comfort foods like fried chicken and meatloaf, and even fresh pasta. This is now my favorite cookbook."
2,"This book is great for Gluten free recipes. Some of the recipes take a lot of time but they are worth it. If you follow the recipes exactly they turn out just like the pictures. I always wanted America's test Kitchen to come out with a Gluten Free cook book. I use a lot of recipes from them, both GF and just plain good recipes that are naturally GF."
2,"This is gonna be a gift. My wife has celiac disease and must eat gluten free. She has seen this book through this cookbook with the assistance of our wonderful inter-library loan system. But, I know she'd feel better and could use it more if she had her own. So, I decided to get this copy for her. Also, this book has an AWESOME cupcake recipe which I hope she'll make again. Soon. :)"
2,New to living gluten free and appreciate good food and cooking and these cookbooks are amazing. Have totally revamped my cooking and lifestyle and these cookbooks really simplifies the process.
2,"After reading the book ""Wheat Belly"" by William Davis, M.D. I decided that a gluten-free diet might improve some of my health issues, while at the same time help to lose a little weight. After 6 months, I am pleased with the results. But this is not a diet so much as a change of eating style because so many delicious foods are so bad for the body. Dr Davis warns against replacing wheat products with manufactured gluten free foods, because they have added sugars, starches, salt etc to these products to make them more palatable, but these are bad. Spurred by my craving for muffins and cookies, I began searching books to make my own GF treats, thinking they would be healthier.
This led to my purchasing ""How Can It Be GF"".This book claims that by following these precise directions, you can cook your own gluten free food that will taste delicious. I have to agree with this, as the various recipes I have tried were successful if not always easy. In fact, if gluten is your only health issue, this book should be great for you. I found it interesting to learn exactly how gluten works in baking, and what must be done to a recipe when it is removed. The down side is that these recipes rely heavily on rice flours and a lot of sugar, so even making them in your own kitchen isn't really healthy. That said, I still think it is a good addition to my library of GF cookbooks."
2,"This is by far the best Gluten free cookbook I have ever gotten. Try the fruit bars or the lemon curd tart, both are spectacular. The only thing I havent loved is the chocolate chip cookies, which were fine just not as amazing as the other recipes I have tried so far. I am super super happy with this book."
2,"I have made 5 different recipes out of this book so far and I must say, the flour mix they came up with and the recipes are off the charts. The chocolate cupcakes, my wife couldn't tell if they were GF or not (I eat GF). The bread blew me away, it actually rose out of my pan and has a crumb that rivals my home baked wheat breads (when I used to do that!). Great buy!"
2,"I'd have bought this book for the pizza crust recipe alone! Wonderful taste, crunchy bottom, soft, chewy top, holds it's shape and cuts with just a pizza cutter. No more cardboard pizza crust for us!"
2,"One or two cornerstone GF cookbooks in our kitchen.. The book does a great job of explaining the effects of different ingredients, which is especially critical for good GF baking. We have wound up using three ""base"" flour blends, including theirs, after reading through this, all home-blended at a fraction of the premix cost with wonderful results."
2,"I have tried only a couple of recipes so far - the pizza crust and the quinoa patties. Both were excellent. The pizza crust was the best GF crust I have eaten. The recipe involves several steps and quite a bit of time, so in the future, I plan to make the crust ahead of time and freeze it till time to use. I am also looking forward to making more recipes from this book."
2,"This is a pretty incredible cookbook! We tried other Pizza crust recipes and they were ok but the crust in here is by far the best! We tried the bread recipe and it is also great! Plus, so much is based on the easy to make and store ""mix"" so it's quick! Love this book! If you are looking for the best gluten-free recipes for your favorite comfort foods, this is the one to spend the money on. I am getting their second cookbook next. I can hardly wait."
2,I heard this reviewed on a PBS station and was prompted to buy it because the individual being interviewed was so frank about how BAD a lot of gluten free products taste! I have tried some of their recipes and have been impressed at the crumb and flavor of the recipes. Definitely recommended for those who are glucose intolerant.
2,"I LOVE THIS book, I understand GF and it was easy to do.
I now have able to even write my own recipes and you would have know idea that, that Chocolate Cake your eating is GF!
This Book is a must for any Kitchen!"
2,Lots of good recipes with easy to understand directions
2,I have tried several of these recipes and they have all been great. In fact my husband has liked these recipes even better than the usual wheat ones and he is an extremely picky eater. I love that the authors explain why they used the ingredients that they did to get the best results. I have recommended this book to several of my friends who have purchased it and have had the same positive results!
2,"America's Test Kitchen did a great job with this one. The brownie recipe is amazing. The blend of flour they produced is cheaper than anything you can find at the store and works better than any I've tried so far. They took a systematic, scientific approach and were honest when their GF recipes fell flat so that they could retool them. Worth the money."
2,"This cookbook is great. I love how detailed it is, and the baked goods I've made so far have turned out better than the non gluten free recipes I've used in the past. I would definitely recommend this book."
2,"I got it for a friend's birthday, she has celiac. She was very excited to get this book. :-)
It is pretty much the definitive cookbook for gluten-free eating, because the test kitchen folks really nailed the cooking science of duplicating traditional recipes in a gluten-free way.
They wouldn't be satisfied until a gluten-free tollhouse choc chip cookie tasted like ""the real thing"" and ditto for bread, biscuits, English muffins, etc."
2,real food not the blah stuff that gluten free can be
2,"just learning to bake my own gf goodies & breads, etc. some stores carry gf blend flour (I asked my Publix about supplying xanth.gum, tapioca flour, and a few other healthy items, and they now have 1/2 an isle strictly for baking gf; me and others are so happy! - never hurts to ask)"
2,"Really like this cookbook & bought one for a friend. She likes it, too. Beautifully illustrated & easy to follow."
2,"I have many other cooks illustrated (Americas test kitchen) cookbooks and the recipes have never failed me. So I ordered this as I am trying to eat gluten free now. The Mac and cheese is wonderful as is the meatloaf. Also made the pesto pasta. So happy to have found this. So glad they wrote this.

Check out this and all the other cookbooks by the company. American classics and the heathy cooking."
2,"Good results when using these recipes. The only downside is that they seem to be very complicated processes that take much longer than other gluten free recipes I've tried. The ATK flour blend is top notch, probably the best blend I've tried. This book is definitely worth having. The muffin recipe is a good one but add a bit more sugar, oatmeal cookies were delicious."
2,"I love to bake and for someone who in the last year discovered an intolerance/sensitivity to gluten, I thought my baking days were over. In addition to breads and other baked goods are recipes for basic everyday recipes that use wheat flour such as fried chicken, meatloaf, pasta, etc. I have already made two of the recipes, Classic Sandwich Bread and Chocolate Chip Cookies and you really can't tell the difference. What I really like about this book is that it tells the reader why the alternative ingredient was used. I plan to use this information as a head start in converting some of my favorite wheat flour recipes. America's Test Kitchen has already done a lot of the trial and error work in developing gluten-free recipes that taste just like the original (like Tollhouse Cookies)!!!"
2,"As with all the America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, recipes are analyzed scientifically,and what works and what doesn't work is explained in plain language. These recipes are especially interesting as they show ways to get gluten free results as tasty as the gluten filled.
This is my gift-book for my friends who have gluten intollerance and Crones disease."
2,"I reach for this time and again. I especially treasure the pie dough and bread recipes, but everything I've tried has been successful. I like all the nerdy tips and explanations for why things work (and why some don't). I've used their ideas in other gluten free recipes with great success! If you can't have gluten, you must have this book."
2,Very useful whether you have just been diagnosed with Celiac or have been eating a gluten free diet for a long time. Explains why certain substitutions for gluten-containing items work well and others are bound to fail. Lots of work went into testing the recipes to make them much easier to follow. Also loaded with product tests to identify the best gluten free brands. Say goodbye to gritty tasteless gluten free foods.
2,"I like everything, appreciate the explanations and research that accompany each recipe, and most of all - the results. Great tasting cakes, with tender texture. All the recipes are great."
2,This book is a life saver. I now actually enjoy eating again. I had gotten to the point I didnâ€™t eat because the food was not desirable.
2,"You can't find a better book for gluten free recipes. Not only does it contain fantastic recipes, but it's a wealth of information on everything gluten free. The recipe for their flour blend is excellent. I used it for the buttermilk waffles and lemon pound cake and the results were fantastic. Will use it for many more recipes in the book. The meatloaf (made with potato flakes) is better than the traditional meatloaf (made with bread) that I've been making for 30 years! I would especially recommend this book to those who are new to the gluten free way of life."
2,"Smart, tasty recipes to replace bread, pasta, and desserts. ATK details every step and explains their decision-making and why they prefer one ingredient over another. Note for WheatBelly readers: ATK is OK with rice and potato flours, and their all-purpose baking mix would not meet with approval from strict Wheat Belly practitioners."
2,Good recipes if you are gluten free. My favorite is the English muffin recipe...
2,"If you are gluten challenged, this book is absolutely vital! America's Test Kitchen has dissected the challenges of gluten free cooking and come up with solutions that will blow your mind! Breads, cakes, muffins, cookies, pancakes, pretty much any wheat flour based food can be successfully duplicated using gluten free flours and additives and ATK tells you how. Also an excellent explanation of WHY gluten does what it does and how ATK scientifically simulates the effects that gluten has on baking while using gluten free products."
2,"Excellent information
."
2,Holy gluten-free goodness! Weâ€™re new to GF and I want to show my daughters that they can still have delicious goodies. I followed the Fudgy Brownies recipe to a T. Best baked good Iâ€™ve ever made... gluten or no gluten!
2,Great book - have made a number of their recipes - the basic gluten free flour recipe was especially useful
2,"I have Celiac, so everything that I make must be gluten-free. I bake gf bread almost every weekend, and the taste, while tolerable, tastes nothing like regular wheat bread. A friend recommended this cook book, so I purchased it. I've got several gf cook books, but only two that I use regularly. I hate the 50 ingredients that are required for every recipe just so that the food is somewhat edible. I spend half the day in the kitchen making 1 or 2 items because gf cooking is labor intensive, and the food still tastes funny. I was told that the recipes in this cook book would taste like the way food used to taste before my diagnosis. I had to buy very expensive ingredients that I do not normally keep on hand for just one of the recipes that I wanted to try. The result was a slightly better taste than my recipe, but not really worth an extra $30 in ingredients. This cook book requires a pretty big commitment on your part to purchase large quantities of expensive gf flours in order to make their specific brand of all-purpose flour. After trying several recipes, the results were okay, but not worth the expense. I would highly recommend this book for somebody who is NEW to the gf lifestyle. The info in this book is fabulous. There are too few recipies in this book that appeal to me. I want regular food, not expensive gourmet dishes, so I was not impressed with their menu or the hard-to-find expensive ingredients. I've already found fantastic gf pasta in my supermarket, and a large chunk of this book deals with making homemade pasta. If you are new to gf cooking - buy this book. The information alone is worth the price, which is why I gave it 4 stars. If you've been cooking gf for a few years and are happy with the results, you might be disappointed in some of the recipes."
2,I have been gluten free 6 years now and really miss white bread and baked goods. The gluten free goods or boxed mixes you get in the stores are usually dry and not a lot of flavor. Every recipe that I have tried in the Test Kitchen cookbook has been great. The rest of my family even eats everything that I make. I mixed my own flour instead of using the flour substitutions.
2,This is the gluten free cooking bible.....everything in it works. I have bought many and gave them out. If you are gluten free....GET THIS BOOK
2,"IMO, best gluten free bread recipe I've tried, using the basic flour mix given in the book."
2,"Made the gluten free classic sandwich bread using ATK's flour recipe for my celiac husband. He says it is better than Udi's. The book gives a great education on why things work and don't work in GF baking, rates the products out there and tips on how to store. Still learning but so encouraged I can improve my husband's life. Thanks ATK!!!"
2,"I could not have requested a better GF cookbook, it's like they read my mind! In true America's Test Kitchen style, you aren't just buying a recipe book with this purchase. You are also buying an education about the HOWs and WHYs of what happens in your recipe, and this is especially important for GF cooking and baking. It could have been titled ""Gluten Free Deconstructed"". I appreciate that they make all the mistakes and figure out all the magic formulas for you in their kitchen and then teach tell you all about it! And not just general tips that will aid you in adapting some of your own recipes, but also tips for each recipe, guaranteeing their success! Each recipe lists the amounts for three different flour blend choices with explanations on how each one changes the outcome of the food you are preparing. All of the recipes in this book are normal every day recipes that normally use flour. A nice change from so called GF cookbooks that are full of recipes that don't call for flour in the first place. I absolutely love and appreciate the product reviews as well. GF stuff is so expensive and when it's beyond gross tasting, it's just such a let down. I was diagnosed with Celiac over two years ago now, and wish that I would have had an awesome reference guide such as this! VERY WELL DONE! I highly recommend this cook book!! Thank you ATK for this master class in making foods that I haven't had in YEARS, accessible and GOOD to eat!"
2,Great cookbook.
2,You can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen. Their GF flour recipe is easy to make and store. The pie crust and waffle recipes are exceptional!
2,Excellent cookbook with tons of recipes and lots of detailed instructions.
2,"At first, I thought it was somewhat intimidating because they often include ingredients we don't keep on hand or have never used, such as psyllium husk. I'm thrilled that our regular go-to GF flour is one of their top 3, though, and so baking from here has been great - the waffles and pancakes are fantastic, if a little labor-intensive. It's worth the extra effort!"
2,"An astounding mix of science, art, and perseverance in figuring out the best means of gluten free cooking and baking. Gets to a level of detail and food chemistry, cooking tips and well tested tricks that the authos say turn gluten free away from tasting like glue. Good reading, and hopefully good eating as this will actually motivate me to bake."
2,"This book has great recipes but the best part is where the authors explain why the recipe works. The book not only gives you recipes you get gluten cooking lessons which will help you develop some of your own recipes. If you need to be gluten free, this is the book to buy. I should know I've already bought enough but wish I'd had this own available several years ago when I started cooking without gluten."
2,We had seen this book on America's Test Kitchen's web site for more than the Amazon price. We decided to get two for our relatives who require a gluten free diet for medical reasons. The recipes look interesting. They really appreciated the gift and liked the recipes they saw and plan on putting the book to good use.
2,"Great recipes, very good food, and great tips on what to bake with, and the outcomes of each different ways of making things. This book gives you lots of recipes and great tips!"
2,"My husband has a sensitivity to wheat and this cookbook has been fantastic. I love the flour blend and it is easy to make, and I have been able to make him things like biscuits and even vanilla cupcakes with vanilla frosting - one of his favorite desserts. There is no getting around the fact that cooking gluten free takes more planning and time, but if you or someone in your family has a gluten or wheat sensitivity, this is a great cookbook. Get it!"
2,"I have learned so much reading this book! I have made moist cakes, breads, and pancakes that taste great and have wonderful textures. This book gave me hope for gluten free baking. I have had great results where prepackaged mixes have failed me. Let the experiments begin!"
2,"This is an excellent cookbook, especially if you are trying your hand at cooking GF. I heard an interview with the authors on NPR and love watching ATK on PBS (yea, that sounds pretty hipster), and ordered this book immediately. The ingredients are attainable and they are super scientific and help you understand, not just make the recipes."
2,This was the first cookbook that I tried with great tasting gf recipes. The gf flour blend is amazing. Most of the recipes are hard to tell they are gf. This is my new favorite cookbook.
2,This book provides great information about gluten free baking with a little science added in. Not only is it filled with good information but the recipes are incredible. I have tried at least 6 or more recipes all with great results and great tastes. One of the best cookbooks I have purchased lately.
2,This is a must have for GF cooking - everything explained with examples of different results from various GF ingredients this book will travel with me.
2,"Leave it to ATK to make great gluten free cooking possible for the everyday cook. They provide great detail on what foods may contain gluten (i.e. Some brands of Baking Powder!), and have reviewed many GF products.

I also have a milk allergy and noted that some reviewers felt that there is too much cheese used in the recipes, I do not find that a problem as many of the recipes have a limited amount of cheese and I simply omit and the dish is still tasty (if there is a lot of cheese, I don't make the recipe). I find this cookbook to be a worthy kitchen companion even with the cheese. I look forward to cooler temperatures outside so I can make their gluten free breads....and they give options to use store bought GF flours or you can use their recipe for a GF flour.

So far, my favorite recipe is the ""Drunken Noodles with Chicken"" p.122.

They didn't rate Barilla Pasta in the book, but they make a great gluten free pasta that is just like 'regular' pasta, I highly recommend It."
2,Great for recipes and for different techniques for gluten free foods! I recommend getting this one as well as part 2!
2,"We own several ""gluten free"" cookbooks and this is by far the best! I especially like the fact that each recipe comes with an explanation on the research done and why the recipe works."
2,"I give this book 5 stars because it arrived very quickly and brand new as I ordered it. I am gluten intolerant, and have been looking for good gluten free cookbooks for about 2 years. This one is the best I have found. It thoroughly explains recipes and the differences between different types of gluten free flours and how they affect the food textures. It is a well done book."
2,I gave the book as a gift. I think they like it.
2,"This book is helpful if you can eat other grains. The cooks are very good about explaining why you need to add certain ingredients to make a recipe work. It does take a lot of ingredients for a recipe, which is the down side. If I make something, it takes me twice as long as it did when I made ""normal"" recipes. However, our 11 yr. old was able to eat carrot cake for her birthday! A huge blessing!"
2,If you are gluten free this is a MUST HAVE book! It explains the scientific reasons why certain things work and don't work when cooking/baking GF. My husband made the Banana Bread recipe and it was delicious. It also give you their flour mix recipe which is easy to make.
2,"It has been a while since I bought this, and have used quite a bit of the recipes in it. Every one worked, and produces the best gluten free I've had. I am not GF, but have a good friend who is, so I try hard to take care to have GF available. They don't have everything you could want, but what is in there is a great springboard to nearly anything you could choose to make."
2,"This book is perfect, and has made dealing with wheat allergy so much more manageable! The recipes not only are easy to follow, there are product recommendations and a well written introduction that helps explain gluten. The book uses products that are easily found, and has it's own flour recipe that far exceeds those I have purchased at the grocery. There are many recipe tips and hints that really work!"
2,"I have been gluten free all my life and have tried many different books and flours. This is a great book. I have been using their flour mix for the last month and LOVE IT.

The only recipes I have tries from this book are the carrot cake and the chocolate chip cookies. My carrot cake was excellent- moist and delicious. The cookies were more cakey that I had hoped, but had good flavor (would recommend nixing the guar gum). I have made waffles, loaf cakes, pancakes, and dinners with the flour and have yet to be disappointed! Definitely worth a try if you are a celiac."
2,"This cookbook is incredible...amazingly detailed research. I have had 100% success with the many recipes that I've tried. I did make the ATK flour blend and follow recipes exactly, which seems to be extremely important when baking gluten-free. We're at sea level so can't speak for the success of the recipes at other altitudes."
2,"My husband has been on a gluten free diet for about a year. We have struggled with finding recipes that taste similar to gluten versions. I am the cooker and baker in the house and was feeling dejected until this book. The drunken noodles are AMAZING and the lemon pound cake tastes like pound cake. I have not tried the bread yet, but suddenly i'm not scared to wasting the ingredients to try and make edible bread."
2,"As usual, America's Test Kitchen delivers."
2,This has been one of the gluten free cookbooks that actually produces a good product. I am happy to have it but because I can't eat eggs many of the recipes don't turn out as well as they could. If Gluten is the only thing that you have to avoid I think this is a great cookbook.
2,"I've only made a few of the recipes so far, but the ones I've made are so much better than any gluten-free mixes or recipes that I have had before. ATK really did their homework and it really shows in the great recipes that they've put together. Very highly recommended for anyone on a GF diet who is tired of the sometimes awful GF products out there."
2,very helpful
2,So far I really like this cook book. My son only cooks from ATK and that's why I ordered it!
2,"The good things about this book:
- The pizza crust is the best gluten free pizza crust you will make. It's fantastic and CHEWY!

- They recommend Bob's Red Mill products in their flour blend. Having 7 years of GF baking experience under my belt, I thought this was odd because BRM tends to have a gritty texture as compared with other brands like Authentic Foods that are finely ground. For me, purchasing Authentic Foods rice flour means a 30 minute drive across town or ordering by mail. I can pick up Bob's Red Mill at the grocery store around the corner and it's inexpensive too! This is a mixed bag, though, because I ONLY use the ATK blend in ATK recipes because it is not finely ground. ATK compensates for the grittiness with extra liquid and resting times for batters. It works well, but using the ATK blend as my all-purpose GF flour would take way more tinkering than I am willing to do to produce good results in non-ATK recipes.

- They have a nice chapter with grain recipes such as Buckwheat Tabbouleh and Curried Millet Pilaf. This is not difficult GF cooking, like baking a good yeast bread, but it's a nice push to think about and learn to cook GF grains besides rice.

- Likewise, the chapter on breads include recipes for naturally gluten free breads, but ones you probably have never made. In addition to corn tortillas from scratch (so easy and a million times better than store bought), there are recipes for Socca (chickpea flatbreads), Arepas, Pupusas, and Brazilian Cheese rolls.

- Everything I have made has worked and tasted good.

The Bad / Odd about this book:
- If you are dealing with food problems besides gluten, this will probably be a difficult book for you to get good use out of. There is powdered milk in their flour blend. ATK suggests substituting soy milk powder and soy milk in their recipes. They give no suggestion for egg substitutions. For butter they suggest vegetable oil, but don't give instructions on how to substitute. And, on some level, this is fine. This is a GF cookbook, not an allergen free cookbook. The issue is that ATK recipes are so fussy that modifying them to cover your particular dietary needs becomes very difficult. For example, the yellow cake recipe calls for 6 oz of white chocolate in the cake batter. It tastes great, but I can't come up with a substitute for the white chocolate that is both dairy and soy free unless I make it myself, and who has time for that?! The pizza recipe calls for almond flour in the crust. Again, brilliant recipe, but how do I make that nut free? I have one child whose only dietary restriction is gluten and another child who currently has to avoid the top 8 allergens (wheat, soy, milk, eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, shell fish, and fish) plus a few more. My solution has been to use this book to make batches of things to freeze for my less-complicated kiddo.
If you are dealing with any food allergy / intolerance besides gluten, you ought to either check this out from the library or grab the kindle version (which is easy to return) before ordering a hard copy.

- I don't get any use out of the sections on quick breads or cookies and I use the section on cakes very little. I get better results using a regular cookbook and subbing in my own flour blend (with finely ground flours) by weight. The two things that I have had a hard time converting are chocolate chip cookies and banana bread. The ATK versions were meh. Not bad, but not special. My family said they liked the banana bread, but it lingered and died a fuzzy death. I was disappointed by the chocolate chip cookies. The wheat ATK recipe from the family cookbook (with the melted butter) is my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. I used to make them all the time. These were touted to be the gluten free version of those, but they fall short. Oh well.

- The recipes are fussy and some are quite time consuming. Not unexpected with ATK. For me this means I grab this book when I know I will have time to cook. I also bake and freeze things. But, unless you have a crust in the freezer, pizza night must be a planned event.

- They have some repeats from other books. I'm neutral on this, although I've included it here in the bad. I don't mind some recycling of content. The stovetop mac n cheese is an important recipe to get into the hands of parents with GF kids because it's just as fast as that box from Trader Joe's but it tastes a million times better.

- As other reviewers have noted, the book contains a lot of ""white flour"" recipes. If you're feeding kids, you are in luck. If you want whole grain bread recipes, better look someplace else.

Even with these issues, I do like the book and use it enough that I pre-ordered the second book."
2,"This book is so informative. The book tells you why the ingredients work and how to make the best gluten free flour there is.The recipes are amazing. We tried the birthday cupcake, red velvet cup cakes, and the chocolate chip cookie and all were awesome. The cupcakes where light and airy with a wonderful taste. The chocolate chip cookies were so good my family didn't think they were really gluten free. There is also bread recipes and pizza dough recipes next on my list for baking. I'm glad we found this recipe book because most store bought gluten free baked goods are horrible. This gluten free recipe book is a must have!"
2,"I can't even begin to express how much I love this cookbook! One flour blend for all the recipes in the book, no strange or difficult to find ingredients (xanthan gum and psyllium husk fiber may sound odd, but are quite common in gluten free cooking and not hard to find any more). I really appreciate that not only are you given recipes that work, the logic and method are explained so that the person baking/cooking can understand *why* they work. Substitutions are given for two of the higher rated commercial blends, and ratings for bread, pasta, and other premade items are given, as well. I've made the pizza crust, dinner rolls, pie crust (which, even if I weren't gluten free, I would make), and a few other things. All of them turned out delicious and were easy to make with easy to follow directions. If you are looking for your first gluten free cookbook, this is a must-have. If you are looking to add to your collection, this is still a must-have."
2,"Although this book is worth it just for the recipes, it is fantastic as a resource for newbies like me to gluten-free baking. American Test Kitchens shares so much with the reader about what they tried, what worked, and what didn't work and why. They also tell you what is necessary for a gluten-free pantry and where and how to store the necessary ingredients. I have now tried many of the recipes and find them SO MUCH BETTER than the commercial GF baked goods that it is well worth the extra time and effort. This is definitely my go to book for gluten free baking!"
2,Cooks Illustrated has done it again. I really do LOVE the explanations and their techniques can help with other recipes from other sources. Their reference pages on grains is superb. I do wish they had included Cup 4 Cup as one of their test flours. Maybe in the future in their on-line as they continue to develop this.
2,"The recipes are the best gluten free recipes I've ever tried. The procedures and products recommended for making each recipe taste, feel and look like the original really do work. I've made biscuits and cookies already and others can't tell the difference between regular and gluten free. I highly recommend this book to anyone needing or wanting to cook/bake gluten free."
2,Tasty recipes for the gluten sensitive!
2,"This cookbook is through in many ways. It has a great variety of recipes, from creative uses of naturally gluten free gains to gf breads and pasta. I am enjoying their recipe for a gluten free blend and it is also helpful to have the option and pointers to use off the shelf gf blends for each recipe. I think this book is great for experienced gf cooks (such as myself with 9 years of gluten free cooking experience and 7 gluten free cook books) and those new to gluten free cooking. Some recipes are time intensive, but worthwhile. I will be giving this as a gift to gf friends."
2,"This book came highly recommended from a co-worker who is gluten free. His wife let me borrow hers and after reading through it, I decided to purchase one for myself. I love how it shows how they came up with their recipes and why they work with the GF flour. Wonderful learning tool!"
2,Lots of good recipes. We've started making our own flour mix and have enjoyed the pizza made with it. The crust calls for psyllium that cost $10.99 at Whole Foods. That really adds a lot to the cost of making our own flour mix even if it is supposed to bake beter.
2,Well worth the price as they really did their homework. Tons of information.
2,"I bought this book for my daughter who does a gluten free diet. She hates reading books but is reading this book all the time, she also rarely bakes but is baking all the time now because of this book. The recipes work and taste great. I love how they explain why the recipe works. There are great pics that show the difference in test batches using different gluten free flours on the market. You can see the textures and read the explanations on why some flours work better than others. Taste is also discussed. You can even make your own gluten free pasta. I've been a fan of their TV show; they know what they were doing. The Gluten Free Cookbook proves it again. It's just an amazing book and highly recommended."
2,"If you want the details of how to gravitate from conventional baking to SUCCESSFUL gluten-free cooking,
this book seems to have it all. The explanations may be a bit tedious at times, but well worth the read if you
want immediately successful results."
2,This book has been life changing for me. Iâ€™ve never been inspired to photograph foods Iâ€™ve prepared until now. Everything scored a 10!
2,Excellent recipes! I bought this book for myself then another for a friend who is also gluten free. I have made 5 or 6 recipes so far and they've been terrific. Especially like recipes for granola bars and breaded chicken that is both crispy and tastes great. Wow! Doesn't happen that often in the gluten free world.
2,This was a gift. My sister has been enjoying the recipes .
2,Must have for gluten free families!! It gives you so much information on brands and why recipes include certain ingredients. Super educational along with easy to make recipes.
2,Our daughter was just recently diagnosed with Celiac and this book appears to have a great number of across the board recipes we will be trying out. I've used several other Test Kitchen recipes and have never been disappointed. Hope I can say the same after trial of several other recipes from this book.
2,"I was looking for a decent chocolate chip cookie recipe, and here it is. Lots of other good things, too. The gluten free flour mix is a nice substitute for regular flour."
2,"I just got all the ingredients for ATK flour and made a loaf of rustic bread. It tasted so much better than any other gluten free bread I have ever tried that we will make it regularly. We also had buttermilk pancakes for breakfast and they were tasty. So far, the book is a very pleasant experience in cooking gluten free."
2,"I am in love with this book. As someone who is trying to make my way over to lowering my gluten intake, this book is very helpful. I was recommended this book by my co-workers who live a gluten free life and they love it! I love that the book explains how and why things work, what cannot be left out and any substitiutions that can be made. I am super excited to have the second book arrive at my house this weekend!"
2,"My husband was delighted to get this. He does the gluten-free cooking for me. He has found this book to be invaluable in helping him make the transition from wheat to non-wheat, and I am the happy recipient!"
2,"I am not kidding--the sandwich bread recipe is to die for. I have been forced to eat GF for a year and hated every minute of it. I have made my own bread for years so store bought bread was never desirable to me. Well, store bought GF bread is even worse! I have tried at least 15 recipes for GF bread and threw most of them in the garbage or out to the birds. There were a few that the birds wouldn't even eat. So for a year I have suffered not having a decent piece of bread until I got his book. I grumbled about all the different ingredients for their all purpose blend but got them and tried the recipe. I almost cried when I tasted it. It was good. In fact, it wasn't just good it was delicious. If you have to eat Gluten Free this book will take you back to the days when you had good food! Just the bread recipe is worth more than the price of this book. Finally, thank you America's Test Kitchen for giving me my bread loving life back!"
2,I got this book as a birthday present and they loved it. They only wished there were more pictures to compare their final outcome to.
2,"I have only tried a few of these recipes, but I am super pleased. Up to now I have not been able to make a chocolate chip cookie that was acceptable - one that was not flat and gritty. This book provides a recipe to make your own gluten free flour. Its better than any of the store bought mixes. The only downside it that it calls for a small quantity of powdered milk, and many recipes call for butter. However, I can attest that powdered goat milk for the powdered milk and grapeseed oil for the butter worked marvelously, the cookies came out awesome. People who can eat wheat will love these and marvel at the caramel like flavor that apparently comes from letting the dough sit for thirty minutes before baking (apparently it causes the sugars to dissolve and thus carmelize better in the oven).

Highly recommend. My only complaint is the physical book. After having it about 2 weeks, the spine came undone. It will be easy to glue it, but surprised it came off so fast...but the content more than makes up for it."
2,"I love America's Test Kitchen cookbooks because they tell you why the recipes work, not just the recipe itself. As someone recently diagnosed with gluten intolerance this cookbook invaluable."
2,gave as a gift and they use it
2,"I love this cookbook. As a newbie to gluten free, this book is great. It is from America's Test Kitchens which is a real plus. They evaluate many of the gluten free products and give great advise for good tasting gf products. Love it! Love it! Love it!"
2,A great guide for anyone interested in the WHYs of gluten free baking without learning a bunch of science. I have made several recipes and all have been successful.
2,"A, true, MUST have for any Celiac. They really did their homework for this one. It is my standard go to cookbook now whereas before I was jumping from one gf cookbook to another. EXCELLENT!!"
2,teaches you more than just recipes. Every interesting
2,"Very informative book, especially regarding gluten free baking. It is very helpful to read the many ingredient alternatives and ""failures"" attempted in pursuit of the best tasting products! The chemistry behind successes is also very interesting!!"
2,This book has some great bread and pie / pizza dough recipes. I am trying the ATK's GF Bread Mix and it works great. Before I bought this book I was unable to make GF bread that actually tasted good. Great pizza recipe also.
2,"This book details the ""why the recipe works"" and details the process they went through to make these conclusions. It certainly helps take the guess work out of gluten free baking."
2,"Excellent book, insightful,uplifting and something to look forward to every day. No the author does not dwell on his survival from cancer like some snarky review said - whenever he talks about it here and there it has meaning and resonates with a lot of people I am sure. I am sure I'll read this book over and over for years to come."
2,great help book
2,"This book has the best GF sandwich bread recipe. Hands down. Also fantastic: blueberry muffins (with slightly reduced sugar), buttermilk pancakes. Miss: cheesy millet (yuck!). I'm still working my way through the book, but I would definitely buy it again."
2,"This is the bible of gluten free cooking and baking. The food science behind gluten free cooking is explained well. The recipes are good (so far) and photographed nicely, which is a plus. I can't say enough good things about this book. Buy it!"
2,At last a Gluten free cookbook that explains the science of gluten free cooking...extremely helpful!
2,I have found this book to be excellent in the detailed instructions in food preparation. Cooking gluten free process is different from the way other foods look in preparation. It has great instructions and pictures! Every recipe I have made has turned out well. The techniques in this book can be very helpful in recipes from other sources. Love it!
2,Tried several gluten free recipes before getting this book and they all turned out so-so. But the recipes I have tried in this book have been really pretty good.
2,Love the explanations as to why each recipe works. Have tried many of the recipes in the book and have found them to be much be much more apt to produce a good to excellent gluten free product.
2,"Thank you, thank you, thank you. 8 years diagnosed with Celiac Disease and I had given up on baking, too many failures, too much money wasted, too many mediocre results . UNTIL I received this cook book. It has changed my life, the pie crust is amazing the thoughtful instructions and ""why it works"" explains all my failures and more! It has also provided the tools to adjust my existing recipes improving them dramatically. The chiapas, lemon bars, and real brownies are amazing! Can't wait to try every recipe!!! This is a must have for any celiac."
2,"Excellent. The first 30-40 pages remind me of a good course at a professional cooking school, very informative. i haven't tried any of the recipes yet."
2,I love the extra tips on how to measure and cook the gluten free way. It is so helpful to see the different brands compared and the end results.
2,I have tried two recipes in this cookbook-the raspberry streusel bars and the sugar cookies. Excellent. Best gluten free desserts I have had since I was diagnosed gluten intolerant.
2,"Able to make gluten free breads etc... that taste like real bread, great kitchen tool if you are gluten free"
2,"I used the gluten-free flour mix to make pancakes and I was amazed that they smelled and tasted just like normal pancakes. I was so ecstatic I bought the book. Most gluten-free products taste so grainy, but this was perfect."
2,Delighted to have such a wide variety of recipes and helpful hints. The opening advice and information is perhaps more important than the great recipes.
2,"Trust the Test Kitchen to really do the homework and come up with recipes that REALLY work. This book contains a recipe for the best pizza crust I have ever tasted, and I can eat wheat. This fantastic crispy crust is better than any wheat crust I have ever had. Thank you America's Test Kitchen!"
2,My family has been gluten free for over a decade now. I am not new to gluten free baking and cooking. This cookbook helped me create the best gluten free biscuits and scones we have had since we learned we had to avoid gluten. The flour combination ATK came up with is the best I have used.
2,The recipes are delicious. You have to a person that likes to cook for this cookbook. Each recipes has quite a few steps to it. This is not for the 30 minute cook.
2,"This was the 1st, also ordered Vol 2. Love them both."
2,America's Test Kitchen brings science to GF cooking! Great stuff.
2,Just made the Oatmeal Cookies. They are great. Not GF great. A Great Cookie for everyone. (except if you are allergic to almonds or eggs.) Just terrific.
2,The biscuits and pizza crust are really good. Everything I've made is good.
2,I bought this for the gluten free pizza receipe and it was great. It is one the few receipes I found without eggs. It comes out just like described crunchy crust and nice chewy consistency. I look forward to trying other receipes.
2,"I absolutely love this cookbook. The recipes are great and everything so far has turned out great! There is only one thing which I don't like and that is the book does not open flat to place on your counter. Almost every cookbook I have from ATK does open flat and I was disappointed when this one didn't. I am going to take it and have the binding shaved and then coil bound. Other than that, I cannot add any more than what has been said in other reviews. Love it!!"
2,"This is the best gluten free cookbook I have ever owned. I love that they give you the science behind how and why the recipes work! I have made my most successful gluten free pizza dough, biscuits, banana bread, cakes and chocolate chip cookies ever from this book. And believe me, I have made many gf attempts at all of these things..."
2,"A family member now requires a gluten free diet and an ad came with Cooks Country magazine so I ordered thru Amazon, slightly cheaper. Information contained is terrific as well as some of the recipes I tried. I enjoy baking but crusts have always presented a challenge, however, the ATK (Americas Test Kitchen) formula for flour is amazing but more expensive than conventional flour but well worth it.. I would highly recommend. A major drawback is the cover separated after using (not abusing) after 10 uses."
2,"The few recipes I've tried have been easy to make and very tasty. All my family is enjoying what I've served them from this book. I highly recommend it to anyone gluten-free, or anyone cooking for a gluten-free eater."
2,"Very useful in learning about gluten free cooking. Every recipe I have tried has worked out well. Really impressed with the lemon pound cake recipe. The only drawback is the lack of alternates for multiple allergies. Many Celiac's have multiple food sensitivities and we frequently struggle to make food without eggs, dairy, and corn (& many others)."
2,Lots of great recipes in this cookbook. Newish to GF and want to try so many of these recipes.
2,Best gluten free recipes ever! Can't tell they are gluten free. Love the cookbook because it tells you why the recipe works and what they tried that didn't work. Take the time to make your own flour...really worth it!
2,Arrived quickly and in good condition. Contains a lot of good information about cooking with gluten-free products and the recipes look delicious. Have only tried one recipe so far. The chocolate chip cookie recipe made cookies that look like regular cookies and taste about 95% as good. The texture is not gritty which is a definite improvement.
2,"Great book, great tv show and great recipes. My daughter is newly diagnosed and really loves this book."
2,This book is well researched and put together by a strong team of food scientists with flavor and health in mind. The recipes are simple and delicious.
2,"Great, proven recipes that were obviously well tested prior to being included in the cook book."
2,"The best resource for GF baking! Have purchased this book for each of my 3 children who are striving for zero gluten and great health!
Thanks to ATK for all their research and awesome actually delicious recipes!!!!"
2,"Haven't used it yet, but love the test kitchen stuff."
2,Great GF cookbook. Best I have been able to find. Their bread recipes are terrific.
2,"The Gluten free bread was a great . We have tried all the recipes, but the one's we did tasted great."
2,"I bought this for a family member who recently became ""gluten free"". I consider this a great resource for all who need to be gluten free!"
2,Fabulous and all you need to live and bake gluten free!
2,"I love to bake and over the past 5 years since we discovered our son needed to eat gluten free, I have experimented with converting my favorite recipes. Some have had more success than others. But this book takes the guess work out of baking. And everything has been tasty and my son's friends could not tell the difference."
2,Well written book with clear explanations on why this process works. I preordered book 2 after testing many of the recipes in this book.
2,"We have had the book for a few weeks now and have tried a number of recipes. So far, everything we have made has turned out fabulous. Highly recommend this book to anyone on a gluten free diet."
2,I gave this as a gift and that person loves it - the guess work is taken out and they could use it right away. Came in excellent condition.
2,"We have made a number of recipes from this, and recommend it highly. It's very detailed; one of the most helpful features is listing the flour quantities to use if you're using their mix, the Bob's Red Mill GF mix, or the King Arthur GF mix. The sandwich bread is great; haven't made anything yet that isn't."
2,This is the book I needed. Finally someone uses objective information to take on gluten free cooking. I will be using this book quite a bit.
2,"The brownie recipe is fabulous, and you wouldn't know the chocolate chip cookies weren't real! This cookbook is so useful in my newly gluten-intolerant lifestyle."
2,"An amazing book with the best recipes ever! If you don't tell anyone they are eating gluten free baked goods, they would never guess."
2,I think the title speaks for itself. Their custom flour mix was easy to create and their biscuits looked and tasted like biscuits :-)
2,My daughter is gluten intolerant. Purchased this for her. She loves the book and we love eating the food! Win win!
2,Perfect! Love this book. Better than hoped for. Fast delivery.
2,I LOVE this cookbook. Itâ€™s so thorough.
2,"Great book. Love the why's, how to's and recipes. Arrived in perfect condition and on time."
2,Nice book
2,"It has very tasty recipes,especially the peanut butter cookies!"
2,"America's Test Kitchen Gluten Free Flour aka ATKGFF is now our go to flour. My wife has been gluten free for 9 years after being extremely sick (lost 50lbs) and being diagnosed with ciliac gene.
I made the coffee cake recipe as a trial and it came out so good people thought I bought it at a bakery. It truly falls in the category ""I can't believe it's gluten free."" I also made the pizza dough which came out great. I have tried many pizza dough recipes from various books and this is by far the best. I just had to get over the idea of spinning the dough over my head."
2,Best cookbook ever if you are gluten free or just trying to go grain free. I tried a few of the recipes and they are excellent!
2,excellent cookbook with lots of information. Especially like where they tell you why certain items do not work on gluten free. Would recommend for anyone who needs to cook gluten free.
2,"Love it, but the spine of my book broke pretty soon after I got it."
2,Awesome book! This book makes it so much easier to be gluten free.
2,GREAT BOOK when getting started on GF Diet.
2,Purchased this cookbook for my sister - She loves it!! Says she's not had a single recipe she and her family didn't love!!
2,"This book rescued my cookies, plain and simple. The brownies are amazing. The carrot cake is moist and delicious. I finally get invited to bring desserts to family pot lucks."
2,Great recipe book for those of us who stay away from gluten. Amazing recipes.
2,best gluten free cookbook I have ever found.
2,The best gluten free book. Helps you understand why your baking did not turn out well.
2,"Very helpful and some excellent recipes. Especially good on the way flours, etc. work together."
2,very happy
2,Got it for Mother's Day. Look forward to settling down and using it. My husband bought it on every high recommendations from a friend.
2,"great cook book, lots of great recipes and helpful information"
2,Love everything that Americas Test Kitchen does so I got this for my daughter who is gluten intolerant and has to cook for a family.
2,"Recipes can be confusing. However, like all the information that describes the different products."
2,"I have so many GF cook books BU""T this one tells you why or why it won't work. LOVE IT, the recipes are tried and true."
2,I ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT FOR A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAS TO BE GLUTEN FREE FOR HER HUSBAND. I'M SURE SHE WILL WELCOME THIS BOOK.
2,"The recipes are spot on, (I've made quite a few) and whether GF cooking is familiar to you or you're brand new, this is an invaluable resource. Structure wise, the book itself is lacking. I wish they had thought to publish in binder form like some of their other books, as mine is falling apart already. Amazon is replacing for me (gotta love Amazon) so my 5 star rating is for the recipes AND for Amazon's fast and easy customer service to fix the issue. The GF baking mix that Is the basis for many of the recipes is fabulous and is easy to mix together. Most baking is more of a science and this is no different, there are steps that need to be adhered to, specific measurements to be paid attention to and perhaps this might intimidate some, but don't let that stop you. Just FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS gwt ich are very clear and concise and easy to do) and you will find much delicious success in your baking. ""Cooking"" gluten free is easy...meat/veg/fruit, etc. Not rocket science, but baking is extremely finicky and now, finally, recipes that truly work. I feel confident in anything I make from this book and most folks don't know it's gluten free unless I say so. If you are vegan, vegetarian, have to watch carbs or sugar then this may not be THE book for you as they are only addressing the gluten issue...so don't order if you're looking for something that deals with other ailments/allergies/conditions. There are many other cookbooks that deal with that as well. And, if you're looking for ""healthy"" recipes, this probably isn't the one for you either. I'm not saying some of the recipes aren't healthy, I'm just saying that's what this cookbook is about. It is making gluten free versions of many gluten laden traditional types of foods that Americans like to eat (cakes, cookies, pasta dishes, etc.) I hope this helps someone in their decision as to whether this book is for them."
2,Very informative Gluten Free Cookbook
2,so far I've only made the flour blend and the recipe for Banana Bread. I was absolutely blown away by the banana bread recipe it was the closest thing to gluten containing banana bread I've ever had. No grit and the recipe was very easy to follow. Also love the recommendations for various gluten free products. Looking forward to trying additional recipes!!!!
2,"As always, America's Test Kitchen does the hard work and hits it out of the park. Their flour recipe is wonderful."
2,The cookbook is well done and has lots of good recipes. Some of the items needed are expensive like psyllium but over all the purchase was a good one. jc
2,I've finally found gluten free bread and baked goods that I actually enjoy eating. Making your own flour blend is a huge money saver as well. As close to life-changing as any product can get.
2,These recipes are tested to perfection. The sandwich bread recipe alone is worth the money! Guaranteed thumbs up!
2,Great cookbook. Just be sure to follow the recommended brands they suggest for each flour if you make the flour blend. Learned that the hard way after mixing up a lot of flour with a white rice flour that was grainy..
2,"So every recipe in here has been developed to be on par taste-wise with their gluten containing counterparts. This is a book amided at perfectionist and could be good for a super motivated beginner since the directions are very good. I have made some of the baked goods and they were delicious. However, the recipes are complex, time-consuming, make a lot of dishes and may require special ingredients-their complexity means only advanced GF bakers will be able to make ingredient substitutions without wrecking the recipes. I will use this for baking things for other people at holidays and whatnot so they don't suspect that it is GF and may even prefer my dish as well as the 1st time I make something so I know what the best tastes like. Since I do not have a kitchen staff of dishwashers and prep cooks I can't see many of these recipes becoming my everyday go to recipes though."
2,I love this book. It was recommended by a friend who is a wonderful cook. I keep asking for her recipes and she finally gave me the name of the Gluten Free Cookbook and I ordered one for myself. Thanks again for all the wonderful recipes for all of us that are gluten intolerant. Ellen
2,We love this book! My husband and I use many of the recipes for our gluten-free bakery and our customers give our baked goods rave reviews! Our Facebook page has a 4.5 star rating with 47 reviews and we've only been open since January 2015 - and most people comment on how good the food is! We can't wait to get Volume 2!
2,"This is a very interesting cookbook. They take the time to explain why certain steps are necessary for the food to taste better than good. It also compares various gf brands of ingredients.
These recipes are as good as regular foods. The chocolate chip cookies are better than regular ones, and the fried chicken is a must try."
2,"So much success on every page, Can always count on America's Test Kitchen. Thank you!"
2,I bought this for a friend who LOVES it.....great recipes!
2,Enjoying trying new recipes. So far all are very well.
2,Got both volumes and love them both. Well worth the money.
2,"NOM! Great recipes, as well as great description of why/how they changed things in recipes. What worked for them, what didn't. That really helps me in modifying my own recipes for GF living."
2,Great ideas. Love the recipes and love the techniques. Great cookbook
2,"This is a well researched and well written book. It is now my go-to book for gluten-free cooking and baking. I recommend it to those who need a definitive book to refer to when cooking and baking. We no longer feel like we miss our favorite foods. This book provides a tasty alternative to so many of our fave dishes, from pizza to coffee cake. Two thumbs way up!"
2,I love the way they explain all their recipes and why they work. Takes all of the trial and error out of it for you. Great book to have on hand.
2,"Great recipes, easy to follow instruction. Wonderful tips on quality gluten free products."
2,"I have been baking and cooking GF for our adult daughter, who was diagnosed within the last year with a rather painful autoimmune disorder termed ankylosing spondylitis. She preferred to approach her nutrition proactively, rather than go the route of only taking medication (which can have serious side effects). Going gluten free for her has been a true God-send because her symptoms became less painful and she has been improved tremendously. When I saw this book, I ordered it immediately and I am so glad that I did.

I am very impressed with the gluten free flour blend recipe, which lends itself wonderfully within recipes in the book as well as with other gf recipes that I have created, and with those that I had obtained via internet, etc. I felt that the recipes would have been highly tested by ATK, and thus my time, energy, and cost of ingredients would be well invested.

Thus far I have made only one recipe that I did not like at all: the crusted pork chops were not satisfying, and IF I should try them again, I will be adding spices to the coating blend. But there are more enjoyable ways to prepare pork chops, so I won't be repeating this recipe.

The Tamale Pie recipe was incredibly good, but be aware that I adjusted left out the jalapeÃ±o pepper (much too ""hot"" for our palate). I substituted about 2 tsps of canned chipotle instead, and for the cheese I used sliced pepperjack. I placed the cheese on TOP of the cornmeal ""crust"" towards the end of baking time. And I used a blend of ground chicken and ground 93% lean beef. It can be made entirely with ground chicken (as well as ground turkey, but I don't especially like this meat). It was very tasty and satisfying. You can adjust the seasoning to suit your palate.

The Pizza Dough recipe was not as nice as another that I've made with the King Arthur Flour GF flour blend recipe that is offered on their website.

The Chocolate Cookies recipe is AMAZING! EVERYONE enjoyed those. Make them and you will be a convert!

The Banana Bread recipe is also a keeper. I used muffin tins though so I could package-and-freeze them.

Be aware that you can adjust the sugar in recipes, reducing a bit (for example: 2/3 instead of 3/4 cup) or using a combo of sugar and Truvia. Make it yourself and save the crazy prices for commercial blends. I also make my own brown sugar. Try that and you will never again buy commercial brown sugars, and won't be caught ""short"" as long as you have molasses and sugar in your pantry. I buy organic coconut palm sugar and raw organic sugar.

The Chicken Pot Pie is a keeper as well. I substitute 2 TBS of the butter with 2 TBS Smart Balance. I leave out the carrots because I don't like the ""sweetness"" that they impart. In place of the heavy cream, I use Fat Free Half 'n Half. A real time saver: Plan to make an oven stuffer and then use the already cooked and flavorful chicken in place of what I consider is the most tedious of steps for cooking the listed 1 1/2 lbs of chicken meat. Personal preference: I add 2 cloves of diced garlic to the sautÃ©ed ingredients of onion, etc. TIME SAVER TIP: I use my mini processor to make sure the onion and garlic are finely chopped (again personal preference and a good step when feeding picky grandsons). I also add freshly ground black pepper and half a can of chick peas (rinsed and drained). The peas had calcium.

The Crispy Chicken Fingers needed help: Added lemon pepper, garlic powder and poultry seasoning to the store bought GF bread crumbs. You can also make GF bread and then make your own bread crumbs. We do not buy commercial GF bread; I make all baked goods myself. GF Panko is another yummy alternative. I buy certain ingredients on Senior Citizen Discount Day at our local Mrs. Green's, such as the GF bread crumbs, the panko, organic parsley/cilantro, and De Boles GF non-cook lasagna pasta. They don't carry the brand recommended by the authors of the cookbook. Our daughter enjoys the veggie lasagna that I prepare for her. I portion out the leftovers and package them for the freezer, giving her a meal that she can count on when arriving late from a meeting.

The Lasagna Recipe can be adjusted to your personal taste and nutritional needs. For example, I use only PART SKIM ricotta and mozzarella. I also add 1% cottage cheese (pulse in food processor along with the ricotta) and nickel-sized ""dots"" of low fat cream cheese. Yummy! And again, Half 'n Half in place of the heavy cream. You can create your own favorite sauce (as long as you don't use anything that contains gluten).

Basically, you can still add favorite spices and herbs wherever you want in any given recipe, if you feel comfortable with your cooking skills. I've been baking and cooking for 44 years, so I am very comfortable with making adjustments. You have to be able to enjoy eating the completed recipes as well as being watchful of dietetic needs (my husband has type 2 diabetes and we both have to monitor our cholesterol levels). And there are copious colorful photographs of each recipe! My one ""problem"" with the book is the text size, but I have eye issues.

I am trying out the homemade pasta recipe this week. I've tried another recipe from another source, and it is great but so much work. I'll see how this book's recipe goes.

Do try the Polenta recipes. We thoroughly enjoy serving chicken cacciatore over polenta. Quite a taste treat, and a welcomed alternative to noodles or rice.

As for the information that ATK offers within the book: ATK includes the rhyme and reason for each of their choices, and included in the book is information on how to use King Arthur Flour company's commercially available GF flour (sold in some markets such as Whole Foods and on the KAF website), and Bob's Red Mill gf flour (available on Amazon, health food stores, and most supermarkets). I have never tried these, as I prefer to use my homemade flour blends that work well with respective recipes.
The advice on which brands to use is a nice feature as well. Also included: Evaluating Commercial Flour Blends, Measuring Ingredient Substitions, what to include in your Gluten Free Pantry, ratings on Sandwich Breads, GF Pastas, the various Grains and How To Cook them. FYI: Bob's Red Mill brown rice flour as well as the white rice flour are quite finely ground, thus not lending a gritty taste. I buy organic whenever possible, especially rice flours due to arsenic in most soils. California brown rice (and Canadian) has much lower incidence of arsenic when compared to the rices grown in soils down south within the USA. Look up and read about prior farming practices and how they impact on the arsenic and other levels within our food chain. Rather enlightening! I've also used King Arthur Brown Rice Flour, which is quite fine, but you have to factor in shipping costs (I generally buy from them when they offer reduced or free ship events). Nuts.com is another good source. Glutensolutions.com charges S/H fee but the prices on Authentic Foods brand of gf flours are really good--- much lower than other sources! Check these sites out and determine what is good for you.

OK, I've written enough. I just hope that you have found this review useful. I have been enjoying the book, and value it as a great addition to my collection of specialized cookbooks. I hope your experiences are equally enjoyable! Bon appetite! Â¡Buen provecho!"
2,"Good book from America's Test Kitchen, really helps you find the ingredients that work best"
2,I bought this as a gift for our gf daughter. She has enjoyed trying the recipes and eating the results.
2,LOVE LOVE LOVE THE PIZZA CRUST RECIPE!!!!! This whole book is great!!!!
2,My daughter was just diagnosed with ceilac's so this book is perfect to get into the gluten free diet.
2,love this book...very helpful
2,i read this book like it is a school book. so much to learn! great info!
2,Good to have this resource. Excellent recipes.
2,Excellent recipes. Fantastic book.
2,this is a great book. i am so glad my husband heard a review of it on nor - i bought it as soon as he told me. no regrets - rave reviews from gluten eaters too!
2,finally they did a GF Cookbook! Understanding why things work makes you a better cook.
2,Best gF book I have found so far.
2,"Great price, quick service -- very practical recipes that work"
2,Great recipes that actually taste good!
2,"The fried chicken was awesome, looking forward to trying a few other recipes."
2,"Thank you America's Test Kitchen! So far we have tried four recipes out of the book and they all are delicious. So great in fact, people are unaware it's gluten free! I will continue to recommend this book."
2,I think the best Gluten Free cookbook I have ever gotten. Very helpful & informative. Good photographs. Can't say enough.
2,"This is the book I have been needing! I went gluten-free a couple years ago, and I've been having trouble with it because I used to love baking, and now I feel like I'm six again because I don't know how to bake without gluten. This book seems to have all the answers. I haven't managed to try all the recipes in the book yet, but I've done several and they're all delicious! I now have a couple brand-new favorite go-to meals. (Macaroni and Cheese, Pasta with Weeknight Meat Sauce)
Not only is the book full of great recipes, and even brand suggestions for the best taste, it explains the science behind why one thing works and another doesn't. This makes it a lot easier to figure out how to convert a wheat-flour recipe to gluten-free."
2,I have enjoyed my ATK cookbook for many years and was happy to discover this gluten free version. It is packed full of great recipes along with the scientific evidence and ingredient source comparisons you come to expect from ATK.
2,Some fantastic recipes here for GF folk.
2,"We had heard America's Test Kitchen discuss this cookbook on NPR, and their chocolate chip cookie recipe needed to be tried!! It did not dissapoint! Cookies were delish and my husband couldn't tell they were GF. Can't wait to try more recipes!"
2,"Was exactly as described, and received very quickly! Thanks!"
2,"Best Gluten Free recipes, ever!!!"
2,Good Book. Lots to read and lots of ideas about Gluten Free bread.
2,"Whether you're celiac, gluton intolerant, or just prefer eating gluton free, this book has good recipes and is an interesting informative read."
2,amazing cookbook!
2,This cookbook is everything it says it is. The cookies come out tasting like cookies (my 6 year old loves them). Every recipe tastes absolutely wonderful. a lot of GF recipes do not taste like the original dish these do.
2,good resource.
2,My daughter in law has just been placed on a strict gluten free diet due to allergies. This book is a good introduction to cooking gluten free. The practical information on shopping and baking was just what we needed.
2,Easy to use and good recipes.
2,Comprehensive with the science behind it. Well done.
2,the very best i could hope for
2,Good source good recipes

2,One of the best books on gluten free we own!
2,Great recipes.
2,Love this book. Has most of my favorite foods. Only thing is i have not mastered the sandwich bread even with following recipe carefully
2,Anything from America's Test Kitchen is fantastic.
2,"Amazing book! Everything comes out exactly as it looks like on the photos. So grateful that these geniuses put their minds to make gluten-free stuff. Ugghh, I just wish they would now make a ""gluten- and sugar-free"" cookbook!!!!"
2,Great cookbook!! I have been baking gluten free for some time and this cookbook really addresses the issues of baking with flours other than wheat. Lots of good tips !
2,Good easy to follow
2,"Great book. I love how it has technical information like 'why this receipe works' along with substitutions for flours. I have come to realise cooking gluten free is a real science and you need to be accurate with your measurements so this cookbook fits the bill. I like that the receipes have really been tested and therefore you have a better chance at success.

The book is set out well with easy to follow instructions and coloured photos of the receipes (helps with motivation). I would really recommend this book for people wanting to understand and cook great gluten free food.

Keep up the good work @ America's Test Kitchen."
2,"This book has hints to make gluten-free recipes turn out exceptionally well. Good research, good pictures, good instructions."
2,great.

2,Everything I have prepared is delicious!
2,"excellent gluten free recipes! gluten free dishes that taste better than ""regular"" food."
2,Bought as a gift; giftee loves it.
2,Expected nothing less than spectacular from these guys. Instructions could sometimes be a little more specific.
2,"I made the pie crust tonight, and it was delicious. I used it for a blueberry crostata that I made frequently before going gluten free, and it was hard to tell the difference. The gluten free crust was flaky, tender, brown and buttery."
2,Every recipe I've tried has been great!
2,This cookbook is great! The desserts don't even taste like gluten free.
2,Exactly what I expected!!
2,"Recipes are well written, advice, alternatives, explainations and suggestins are very helpful"
2,This is a great book.Helps with bakeing great gf bread.
2,I have cooked four recipes and they have all been excellent. The recipes are clear and easy to follow. The information is interesting.
2,"I am new to GF cooking and this is an excellent resource. Every recipe I have tried has turned out perfectly. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for easy, reliable gluten free recipes."
2,"given as gift, seemed to enjoy"
2,Great book!
2,The recipes may seem fussy with a multitude of instructions & precision of measurement but it is worth the bother to follow them. Everything turns out exactly as predicted and tastes great.
2,This is an awesome cookbook that makes gluten free food that is truly edible and often indistinguishable from its gluten-ful brethren.
2,Good source for cooking GF
2,As advertised and expected.
2,Excellent book. I would strongly recommend to anyone with Gluten restrictions.
2,Nice to know. That all of the recipes have been tested. No mess ups. Great variety of recipes.

2,I love this book and all the recipes I have tried so far have been just wonderful!! I cant wait for the second book or maybe a Desserts Only book!
2,My family says the bread recipe is the best gluten free bread ever
2,GREST BOOK. BREAD IS WONDERFUL FROM THIS RECIPE.
2,Excellent quality book. One of the best gluten-free cookbooks I own. Highly recommend.

2,"I like some of the recipes, however, it is somewhat laborious to figure out the flour mixture. And it is very expensive"
2,Great book
2,"Glad I got this. Saved me from buying Cup 4 Cup flour which is expensive. Felt they could have used blanched almond flour a little more when protein was needed, so less than 5 stars."
2,Great gluten free cookbook!
2,"Excellent book ... very informative, with lots of ideas (especially for someone new to this diet)."
2,Gave it to a step daughter who is a wellness coach. She loves it!
2,"My husband has made so many of the recipes. Great cookbook, gluten free or not."
2,"Very worthwhile. Many choices of
Foods. Easy to read. Easy to follow
The recipes."
2,Great book for the baker in me!
2,"I found this book to be very good, the closest to mimicking what is regarded as normal, in that the gluten-free flour blends go. It is the baking I am more interested in."
2,Great book! We already have the flour blend in our cabinet and have tried one recipe. Love the time and effort that was out in to get recipes just right! Excited to try more!
2,Excellent book & great reference for gluten free cooking
2,Cook's Illustrated never disappoints and I love their discussions of why each recipe works.
2,I have alot of friends who are gluten free and this book is excellent in guiding me in gluten free cooking that tastes good. We have pot luck dinners together so I can bring food that is enjoyed by all.
2,The gf people in my life are thrilled to have such tasty food sans gluten
2,Very informative.....especially for those who are new to the gluten free scene. The information regarding the best gluten free brands is nice.
2,It was a gift for a friend who has Celiac disease and she pronounced it just awesome.
2,"Looks very helpful, but have not used it yet."
2,Great gluten free recipes that are delicious
2,verygood
2,I found this to be the best gluten free cookbook I have come across.. explanations of why you do it a certain way was very helpful
2,"I love it and am cooking recipes out of it several times a week. It truly is a blessing for gluten-free people, which I am not, but our son-in-law is. Thanks for a great book."
2,Delicious recipes! Can't wait for volume 2 this fall!
2,Love this cook book.
2,This book has great recipes that have helped me be able to enjoy foods that I haven't had since being gluten free!
2,"The author not only tests the recipes, he explains why they work or don't work. My left brain appreciates this approach to cooking."
2,A great book for gluten free beginners who are looking for gluten free bread recipes as well as other recipes.
2,exceptional information
2,I particularly like the way ATK included alternative measurements for using King Arthur flour. That way I have a choice.
2,ATK never disappoints the cook with it's accurate and extensive information. Made cookies that turned out great.
2,"Finally someone figured out how to do this. Great taste, and well worth the work to cook these.
I can't wait to try more!"
2,I am excited to see and feel the healthy differences physically. The opportunity to be healthier in every way begins now. Thank you for the quick delivery and great financial value.
2,I have a daughter and a granddaughter who are on gluten free diets. Your cookbook has given me hope that gluten free food can actually taste good!
2,"nice color pictures, detailed instructions, heck even my husband was perusing the book and couldn't wait to make some of these recipes. Trying to find decent gluten free recipes is not always easy.

Only one improvement would be if the book was spiral bound so that it would lay flat.."
2,I trust the cooks from AMerica's Test Kitchen............looking forward to cooking more from this book....but so far what I have tried is good.
2,"This book has recipes that really work and it tells why they work! The pizza recipe takes a long time, but it's wonderful!"
2,Pizza and pancakes are the two meals I missed most when we went GF...all is well now in our house.
2,Thanks!
2,"Never thought I would GO gluten free, but these recipes make it easy AND delicious. Love it."
2,We trust this team and refer to this book often.
2,This is the best cookbook for gluten free that I have found. Very informative.
2,Excellent book for cooking gluten free foods and the rationale for why certain ingredients must be included
2,What a great book!!!
2,Lots of great ideas!
2,"Innovative and very helpful. - cant wait to make some pasta!
Thanks
Craig"
2,"This is the bible for the gluten intolerant. Lots of recipes, products and information.This will be in the front of your shelf."
2,good recipes
2,I found this book very helpful. The suggestions and recipes were very good.
2,Best gf book ever.
2,I'm a huge fan of the TV show and I know that they put a lot of hours into testing each recipe. Not only was I excited to get their ratings on store bought items such as pasta and bread but also have a GF flour blend. It's also nice that they give you the option to use their GF blend or use a store bought version. I've been baking up a storm and my husband (not GF) can't tell the difference. They also have regular recipes (e.g. stir fry) which I will try this week.
2,"Easy to follow instructions, great recipes. Very excited about making my own gluten free foods."
2,"well-researched, concise."
2,Gave it as a gift. Tried the banana bread and it was really good. It was a big hit. Thanks.
2,"I would give it four stars except I was so disappointed that all the baked goods are made with rice, which my health letters are warning me can cause cancer and children should have very limited consumption as well as pregnant women. So I will sill have to adjust the flour and will use Manini's rice free.flours."
2,This book is wonderful!! It has helped me so much to cope with going Gluten Free.
2,Lots of information and good ideas!
2,"Part cookbook, part science project. My motto- Always the experiment, never the control."
2,AMAZING
2,"The best thing about the book, I think, is the breads, rolls, and other pastries it details how to cook. I have others that mostly have recipes for main dishes. I have not yet made anything but I will know where to look when I want to."
2,"Worth it for the few key items. Most of the basic recipes are just that, basic, and should already be known. But the handful of ingredient recipes (for lack of a better phrase) like flours, doughs, etc are worth the price of admission. If you're familiar with ATK, then you'll be familiar with the layout, tone, style of this book.

2,really quite good gluten free recipes.
2,"This cookbook had some good reciptes for gluten free items. It is worth looking at, if you want to cook gluten free."
2,The recipes are easy to follow and taste great!!
2,Great book. Exceeded expectations.
2,great book - quck shipping - as described
2,awesome! .... very new to forced to be gluten free due to health VERY HELPFUL
2,So clearly written. Written for my kind of cooking!
2,This is a gift for a Gluten Free Friend
2,This is an outstanding book. I wish I had purchased it sooner! It explains how to cook to make Gluten Free foods taste better
2,lots of valuable information and tips
2,Bought this for two nieces one who has to eat gluten free due to health reasons and the other who chooses to. I saw this book at a friends home and she said she had purchased through amazon. I'm sure that my nieces with enjoy the book and use it all the time.
2,"I was so excited to get this cookbook as I am a fan of the American Test Kitchen. I am overall happy with it. It has a picture as well as a ""why it works"" section for each recipe. The ""why it works"" part explains why the ingredients chosen are so important. The recipes are ones that any family can use. I haven't tried any recipes yet as I just got the book recently. I'll let you know how they go."
2,"I have a ton of gluten free cookbooks, so I was hesitant to buy another one, but apparently, I'm up for punishment, because I caved in and bought this one. Am I glad I did. Lots of good recipes with ingredients I can actually FIND in my local grocery store and that aren't found in some obscure health food store in the corner of the state. The recipes themselves are for real food, but with lots of information to back up the testing and alternatives.

This is absolutely one gluten-free cookbook that should be in your kitchen."
2,wonderful source of GF recips
2,Recipes taste so amazing!
2,Essential for any GF cooking
2,"Great ideas that open up a brave new world, which is not so much new as it is a change in viewpoint with exciting options. With no loss of taste or variety."
2,"Recipes are very good - make many of them over and over again! If you are GF, this is the book to buy!"
2,I was disappointed that their gluten flour mix used rice flour.
2,Looked great. I am gluten free and I gave it for a gift.
2,Wonderful new approach with good scientific reasons for the various flour mixes
2,"I am quite excited to get this,there were several to choose from. I think i choose the ""right"" one,as it is from the American Test Kitchen! I have not had a chance to try any of the recipes yet,but i have brosed throughand i love the way they explain their recipes. I think it would be a great choice for anyone ""newly"" diagnosed as Gluten Sensitive or has Celiacs disease. At this point...to be continued. :-)"
2,"Still have to try out a few recipes, but it looks good so far."
2,I gave this as a gift to a Doctor and his family.
2,Great cookbook. I'm delighted to be baking again.
2,Great book. Still trying recipes.
2,Interesting!
2,Good book
2,Very satisfied with my purchase !!!

2,The instructions and results are PHENOMENAL!!!!!!!!
2,Very thorough for gluten-free cooks. Now I can actually bake bread again!
2,"Just what I have been waiting for in cookbooks.

2,The How can it be gluten free cookbook arrived right on time. This is a very good book for those needing gluten free books
2,Made the cornbread recipe and it was perfect. Looking for to trying the rest of the recipes.
2,"I have been gluten-free for three years and the information and recipes in this book helps me understand why most gluten free bread was unpalatable. The ratings, explanations and recipes are worth the price of the book and more. 5 stars for sure!"
2,"A good book with lots of explanations and information as well as good recipes for those with Celiac's Disease.

A. Lee"
2,I use this book often and have recommended it to many friends.
2,"We loved getting a great deal on this book--we've tried so many recipes since my daughter went gluten-free a year ago, and it's such a relief to have a book that contains recipes that will turn out great, every time."
2,I purchased this cookbook for my sister who is a celiac patient. She received it last Saturday and was really pleased with it! She learned lots from its contents and was completely happy with the gift!
2,It is a lot more than a recipe book. It has detailed product ratings and explanations for the various GF flours other products required for GF cooking. Thanks for putting this book on the market. I am going to tell all my GF friends about it.
2,Great recipes. The yellow cake recipe was delicious!
2,Gift for son-in-law on Father's Day and he was VERY pleased and is anxious to start. Gluten Free can be taste free!
2,this book was ordered as a gift. One corner of the cover arrived bent. This has never happened to me when ordering a book before.
2,"I bought this as a gift, so I can't personally vouch for it yet."
2,A gift for my niece. She will be happy with it.
2,Gift
2,Have yet to try it but reads well
2,I liked this book. I made several of the recipes.
2,"My wife is glutarded which has left our house with terrible tasting gluten free products trying to emulate the wonderful tastes, textures and smells of gluten products. This book is the first cookbook we have found where things come out tasting like their gluten counter parts. This book has brought flavor back into our home."
2,my wife was very excited about this cookbook and found quite a range of recipes. She is very happy with it
2,"This is perfect for what it is: a book for Celiac-types to enjoy the things they are used to, by Cooks Illustrated. I'll break that description down for you, so you really understand. This isn't a book for people who have chosen the gluten free lifestyle just for the health of it. The flours they use are the most basic and have the least nutrition. The blend is like a canvas you can use in many different applications, and therefore is as basic as can be. Also, if you love following CI recipes, then you will have no problem with this book. If you aren't used to the precise, fussy, almost manic nature of Cooks Illustrated recipes, then you have some adjusting to do. We like to say that CI recipes require you to stand on your head while you pour the hand expressed milk of Siberian mountain goats into a crystal bowl at just the right temperature and angle. Let's face it: the recipes can be fussy. For pancakes, you will be folding whipped egg whites into the batter. For yeast bread, you will be creating a foil collar for the pan - you'll need a stapler! For flourless chocolate cake, you must begin preparations a full day before you actually want to serve the cake. What I have found with all CI recipes is that you need a stocked kitchen. If you don't, and you want to keep using their recipes, you soon will have a stocked kitchen. What you lose in the minutiae of it all, you usually gain from a foolproof and flawless product.

I've been using this as my primary cookbook since my husband was diagnosed, for over a year now. I've used it for all of our birthday celebrations, so I've made the carrot cake, the yellow cake, the chocolate cake and the flourless. They all came out just fine, looking like celebration cakes and tasting pretty good on the first day. They really suffer from dryness the longer they exist (except the flourless). So freeze asap. I've really used the heck out of this book, and I'm just starting to branch out and use the flour blend on its own.

The flour blend is gold if you want to try a conventional recipe with a flour substitution. I've had success with every quick bread I've attempted, as long as I apply the half hour wait rule (let your batter rest a half hour to reduce grittiness). I also use the flour blend for every roux I make.

And for those who will purchase and use this book, if you want to add a ""better"" flour to the blend, I've had 100% success replacing the brown rice flour with sprouted sorghum as they have similar weight. Good luck. It isn't easy being clean."
2,"After being diagnosed with a wheat intolerance, I have adjusted using a variety of gluten free flours, and starches. I have always thought I was a pretty good gluten free baker. However, there have been plenty of dry, gritty muffins and cakes. Then there is the elusive biscuit. For years I have tried different flours, fats, more milk, less milk, and even putting them in little tart tins to keep them from spreading all over to no avail. I had given up on ever having a decent biscuit again.

Then I got this book as a Christmas gift, and I was enthralled. I love that the authors explain the science behind the recipes. I can understand why all my attempts failed. This holiday season, using this books recipe, I had the most amazing biscuits with a light butter crumb and golden top. It was an absolute delight to break it in half and spread it with a bit of jam, and munch it down while sipping on coffee. Now it is not the same as a wheat biscuit, so there will never be an apple to apple comparison. Yet, it is a wonderful biscuit.

I have since made scrumptious blueberry muffins and I look forward to further baking. If you like the science behind what works and why, and baking up fabulous foods, this book is a must have on your bookshelf"
2,"My daughter and daughter-in-law are both gluten free. My husband has consistent digestion issues, so I thought I would see what America's Test Kitchen came up with.
I have made a corn bread that was delicious and created a dressing or stuffing out of gluten free bread last Thanksgiving, but I really wanted to learn the ins and outs for cooking gluten free.
What I really liked about this book was the test kitchen's own gluten free flour recipe. Plus they reviewed Bob's Red Mill and King Arthur flour mixture for gluten free. Then beside each recipe they explain how to adjust the recipe depending on the flour you are using.
I was impressed by this book and will put it on my wish list. I checked this book from my local library."
2,These folks have done the experimentation (I use that word because they have the detail oriented minds of scientists) to solve the serious problem that removing gluten causes in so many recipes. Great waffles? CHECK. Great pancakes? CHECK. So many great dinners. This book has been used so much in the few months we've had it that the binding is failing. Don't Care. What's on the pages is life changing. (or really UNchanging. Those who have lost the ability to include gluten in their diet will know what I mean. This should be the first cookbook you buy after diagnosis.
2,"I bought this book because I have recently learned I have a gluten allergy and I need to be gluten (mostly) free. I was looking for something that had high standards... and I found it! What I love about this cookbook is it's basically comparing the result to the Standard American Diet. So far everything I've made has come out really well and I've been very happy with the results. Another big plus, if you have any of the other cookbooks from America's Test Kitchen, you can interchange their gluten free techniques with their other recipes. For instance, I have the Slow Cooker Revolution cookbook where they use panades. This book describes an alternate technique using potato flakes, and because they are so thorough and describe in detail how it works, you can easily substitute the gluten free panade technique in their non-gluten free recipes.

My favorite things about this book: 1) The sandwich bread recipe, 2) The Jovial pasta recommendation (that stuff is awesome!), 3) the interchangeability with other ATK books, and 4) the inclusion of international foods that are traditionally gluten-free (corn tortillas, Brazilian cheese buns, etc..)

As I mentioned above, the sandwich bread recipe is fantastic! However, they have you do a whole fancy foil collar thing which is such a hassle. Instead, I use a Pain de Mie pan and bake for 2 hours. I tent the top with foil after an hour to keep it from over browning, but you can also bake it with the lid on for a more square loaf. After 1.5 hours, I turn off the heat and let it sit in the oven for the additional 30 minutes. When I tried it with the ATK flour mix, it was pretty good but had a Rice Dream aftertaste to it. I like Rice Dream so I thought it was pretty nice. I tried it again replacing all of the rice flour with sprouted brown rice flour and it was less Rice Dreamy and more like the 50/50 sprouted whole wheat/white flour sandwich loaf I used to be so fond of. I didn't have to adjust anything and used the same proportions of everything else. If you have issues with oats, I'd try replacing them with Sorghum flour (assuming you don't have issues with that).

Note that many of the gluten-free baked goods do not keep well for more than a day. I'm currently experimenting with freezing the end results. They have information on storage for most things but for many of the baked goods, they don't really tell you if you can freeze the final product or not. For instance, I'd like to make the pasta ahead of time, is it better to cook the pasta and then freeze it or can I freeze the uncooked, rolled out dough until I'm ready to cook it?

My biggest issue is I feel the book is slightly incomplete with regards to key cooking techniques. For example, they don't really address the roux issue. The Baked Macaroni and Cheese recipe talks about rouxs but claims corn starch does a sufficient job of thickening in that case. I'm really not a huge fan of cornstarch and I've found rice flour makes an excellent roux substitute, I've had no trouble substituting it 1:1 for the amount of cornstarch. I would have liked to see that they experimented with making rouxs with different flours. I was also disappointed in their choice to use vegetable oil as a water-free fat source in many of their baking options. Like in their pound cake, they use vegetable oil, but clarified butter could have been a viable substitute without sacrificing as much of the butter flavor. Clarified butter and lard are both typically used in other baking applications where a water-free fat source is desired without sacrificing flavor. Light olive oil would be an ok choice as well.

All of that being said, they do a great job of documenting how the different ingredients work so it opens things up for your own experimentation in the event you have dietary preferences that differ from what is presented. I personally am not a fan of the high amount of white rice flour and before I had to eliminate gluten from my diet I preferred sprouted whole wheat. I've been experimenting with replacing the flour mix with a higher ration of sprouted brown rice flour. For some recipes it works to replace 100% of the rice flour with it, otherwise for lighter crumb things like cupcakes, 50% is pretty good. Sprouted brown rice flour is softer and less grainy than traditional brown rice flour. As well the nutrients are more bio-available. I also use raw honey and sucanat in place of the refined sugar options.

So, to summarize:

What this book is:
- Recipes that cater to the Standard American Diet made with All Purpose White Flour and refined sugar
- Recipes that actually taste good enough that non-GF people can also eat them without complaint
- Lab tested techniques for mimicking the properties of gluten in various applications

What this book is NOT:
- This is not a low carb cookbook.
- Other than gluten (as the title indicates), this is not an *insert food sensitivity here* cookbook. If you have a reaction to any gluten-free foods (corn, oats, etc), you'll have to do your own experimentation to substitute.
- This is not a *insert the latest snake oil diet fad here* cookbook, so don't complain if it doesn't cater to your current dietary fancy or promise to cure you of all your ails."
2,"This book saved my sanity!
I'm not one for fad diets or worrying too much about specific foods or ingredients in my diet, but recently had to go gluten-free by doctor's orders, due to some health issues. My sister sent me this book as a gift and it has been a lifesaver!
After trying a few store bought ""gluten-free"" baked goods, I had decided that gluten-free stuff was completely unpalatable and figured I'd just have to forget about ever eating anything like cake or muffins again...until I used this book. This book gave me hope for still being able to feel like I can eat a lot of the foods that I'm used to.
I love the very scientific, methodical approach they use in refining their recipes. This book is a great educational tool in learning about what gluten is, what its function is in different types of recipes, and how to make various substitutions yourself. I love how they describe the process they went through in developing each recipe, the problems they encountered, and what they did to address those problems. I feel like they give all the tools necessary for someone who wants to learn how to develop or alter their own recipes. If you're willing to take some time to sit and read what they have, you'll learn a lot of useful information!
I've tried several of the recipes so far and have been very impressed. Most of them, I don't think someone would even know they were gluten-free if you didn't tell them. The chocolate cake was delicious (I'm so excited to still be able to eat chocolate cake!) and the muffins were too.
The book gives a lot of tips on things like storing or reheating the foods from these recipes as well, since gluten-free foods tend to react different from others.
I feel like this book is a ""must-have"" for anyone wanting to learn to cook their own gluten-free food that actual tastes like regular food! However, it's only designed for gluten-free. If you have other restrictions, like dairy-free, or egg-free, etc. it may not work very well for you."
2,"Bottom line if you love cooking in general and need to eat gluten free this is a great tool to have on hand. I have bought and or checked out of the library a LOT of gf cookbooks and this is by far, my favorite. Yes, you do actually have to cook to use this book. A lot of the recipes are quite involved, but the results are fantastic. These are not recipes that are '30 minutes or less' or recipes that use convenience foods. I have been steadily working my way through the cookbook. Every single recipe has turned out great. If you've been gf for awhile you know the odds of that happening are way out there. No longer do you have to wait for the moon to be rising over Capricorn and the wind blowing from the east, just right to make GOOD gf food! Well worth the cover price or do like I did, and check it out of the library to test it out ,this book is awesome. Love it, it has been a long hockey puck, gooey pancake, deflated bread road for us, but books like this one, that actually explain the science behind gf cooking are indispensable in my opinion."
2,"Let's start with first things first. I don't look at gluten free bread recipes or any type of bread only for the nutrients it provides. Not saying that nutritious bread is not important, but too many years gluten intolerant people and wheat/grain sensitive people did not have bread at all...or nothing that you looked forward to eating. Sandwiches made of rice cakes and lettuce leaves just didn't cut it. So to all the reviewers who start out mentioning disappointment that the recipe in this book for sandwich bread is not nutritious enough, how about admitting that at least this is a very flavorful, taste-good BREAD that makes a great sandwich. So add egg salad, cheese, peanut butter, and roast BEEF....and voila....you got your protein. What's so great about this bread is that it's pretty easy to make, doesn't 'pour' into the pan, and makes a high enough loaf to accomodate a 'normal' sized sandwich. I've made the bread three times since getting the book a couple of weeks ago and it came out almost perfectly (what is perfect?), was easy to slice, made great sandwiches and that's all I ask. This is the best I've ever found and I love it. Now maybe the technique can be improved upon and things will get even better. But for now I'm grateful, will keep on making and enjoying this bread and look forward to testing all the other recipes also. I notice none of the less enthusiastic reviewers offered any better suggestions....or none that I read. I'll try to read all 400 plus and maybe learn about something as good or better."
2,"This is my go-to gluten free cookbook after 10 years of eating gluten free! Cooking great food is a point of pride for me. I feel like an ambassador to the gluten eating world with an ambition to show that gluten free CAN be tasty, sometimes more tasty than glutenful food. To that end, I've been inventing my own baking recipes for years because most of the commercially available recipes were really not very good. The recipes in this ATK book are so good, I have replaced several of my own inventions, including my famous chocolate cupcakes, with the ATK recipes.

My favorites are the meatballs, chocolate cupcakes, white chocolate cupcakes, pumpkin bread, fried chicken, and apple pie. Plus, the ATK flour mix exchanges well in other recipes.

I made a few modifications to some of the recipes. In the fried chicken, I used GF corn flakes instead of cornmeal to bring out the cruchiness. In some of the sweet breads, I added in xanthan gum to help hold everything together. It changes the texture a little bit, but it ensures no one eats his bread with a spoon."
2,"With 3 Celiac's in the family this is our Bible. I have not found better recipes for staples anywhere. The pizza, pie crust, flax bread, buckwheat pancakes, chocolate chip cookies, cinnamon raisin bread, apple cake, are some of our favorites. The chocolate and white cakes are some of the best we have tried. There was only one recipe we didn't like, the Cheddar Cheese Bread, and that is saying a lot...we are a picky bunch. The dinner rolls are more like a biscuit in density but they are amazing. I would buy this book just for those. It has lots of great suggestions and brand advice for those who are new to GF but not so much so that it over powers the book. The meal recipes aren't the most original, you can probably find those for free just searching the internet. But for baked goods, this is the only thing you need. I do use their ATK flour mix and like it much better than the store bought versions. Try this book you won't regret it, and the rolls...they are amazing!"
2,"Love this cookbook and very highly recommend it. Between my sister and I who both have Celiacs we have made about a dozen recipes so far and have only had one flop. If you are dying for good pancakes this is where you will find them. We really use this book more for the basic recipes and have little use for the grain salads and entree recipes for the most part but may try some of those out eventually. Can't wait for their next GF Cookbook this fall.

Yellow Layer Cake, everyone thought it tasted cornmealy, there was no corn in it, no one at the party liked it.. I have had better luck with cakes by taking a gluten recipe ( a couple of Martha Stewart's) and replacing the flour with a good starchy blend like Trader Joe's or Jule's."
2,"Thatâ€™s the main thing about this book â€“ there are all sorts of gluten free recipes out there, but many rely on mixes that are pricey and often really not that delicious.

As usual, Americaâ€™s Test Kitchen (ATK) has exhaustively researched what does and doesnâ€™t work -- this time, in the interest of best approximating the flavor of real, gluten-filled favorites using gluten-free ingredients. Thereâ€™s also a well-curated selection of traditional gluten-free â€œstarchâ€ recipes such as risotto and Asian standards featuring rice or buckwheat noodles.

Itâ€™s fairly obvious that this book is aimed squarely at the gluten-intolerant, and as such will disappoint its share of low-carb/paleo/anti-GMO/anti-grain types who really are trying to shift the balance of their diets to heavy veggies, moderate protein/fruits and light on the carbohydrates. Still, even if it's just a philosophical aversion to wheat that keeps you from enjoying the odd carb-y treat â€“ say, fruit-filled crepes â€“ thereâ€™s an amazing recipe here for you. (I took out the sugar and added a bit more of the ATK gluten-free flour blend to make them savory spinach crepes for a recent dinner.)

About that flour blend: Iâ€™ve tried a few. Havenâ€™t tried King Arthur yet, but between various gluten-free baking mixes and several gluten-free baked products Iâ€™ve tried, I was under the impression that itâ€™s better just to give the stuff up, as the logical substitutions can range from artificial-tasting to downright nasty. ATKâ€™s rice-based blend is exactly the revelation Iâ€™d hoped for here.

The one disappointment in this book is that the use of nut flours, such as almond or coconut, is at a minimum. These flours are rich in protein and â€œgood oilsâ€, and I canâ€™t guess whether ATK found them wanting in one quality or another for the bulk of their recipes, or just really got involved in testing the possibilities with their one, carefully proportioned blend. Perhaps itâ€™s even concerns about multiple food sensitivities that keep these recipes mainly on the rice-corn-quinoa-potato-tapioca side of the spectrum. Still, Iâ€™d love to see ATK do a second â€œagainst the grainâ€ take with fewer desserts and a bit more carb consciousness.

Which â€“ I well realize â€“ would be a different sort of cookbook."
2,"Haven't we all been waiting for ATK's version of this?? You can always trust their OCD to exhaustively research the chemistry behind cooking in general and how GF differs. I think it's fair to say white bread is the Holy Grail of gluten-free cooking, and the basis of a number of sweet recipes that rely on a certain kind of flavor profile that allows other flavors to shine. (Cinnamon rolls and kuchens come to mind) So I'm happy that they even tried to come up with something white that's more nutritious than the typical GF white which is EVERY BAD THING their testers say it is! I chuckled when I read their remark that we all have a stack of GF cookbooks, yet we're searching for another one. Why? Because most seem to be written out of need by a non-chef, non-food chemist who came up with recipes they can live with, but we all try them and go, ""Whaaa...?"" Bread recipes that taste like I milled my Birkenstocks into flour to make them! I was also disappointed in ATK's ""multigrain"" bread, but you know what's great? ATK actually tackled the GF cooking issue at all. Those of us at this awhile know there are more flavorful flours you can add, and I bet ATK's revised edition of this cookbook will have that info. Maybe they'll try some other grains next time, maybe on a tv episode. For now, it is enough that you and I can take the science from ATK's basic recipes and successfully tinker with them, something every ATK fan already does with all their recipes. Am I right?

As for a cookbook that addresses multiple food allergies, I can recommend with caution one titled The Healthy Gluten-Free Life by Tammy Credicott. This one eliminates dairy, eggs and soy in addition to wheat. (we have that in our household) She uses coconut, which is not a nut and is often tolerated by people with life-threatening nut allergies. Her book also begins with the way ingredients behave in the recipe. I think her recipes have a lot of ingredients, and you should try them only if you can buy bulk just what you need of the more expensive ones. But she explains why she does it and what can and can't substitute. Here is my only caution: There is NO WAY her white bread is as white as her photo with a full cup of teff flour in it! It is a delicious bread but it is brown.

As for ATK, I'm giving it 5 stars and I haven't even finished the first recipe yet. (White sandwich bread is rising as we speak.) Why? Because someone who bakes and cooks a lot can tell when something looks like it'll work or not before we try it. And I like that there aren't a million ingredients in each recipe so you aren't heavily invested financially in something that you may not like. I'm sure I'll tweak their recipes and so will you. But you know you can trust what you start with if you follow it carefully. Cooking is about equal parts art and science---GF cooking is 1/4 art and MOSTLY science. Thanks, ATK for enduring all those duds you had to make and eat in order to deliver this book to us!"
2,"This is not my first American Test Kitchen(ATK)cookbook and in general their attention to detail is unique. ATK goes to great pains to create the best version of any recipe, and if more information is of interest, they also provide helpful tips, substitutions, step-by-step photographs and an explanation of why a recipe works. So, although it is not mandatory to do anything beyond read the recipe, if desired, the user can learn a great deal about every step in the process. This is how ATK construct their cookbooks. The chemical reactions necessary when attempting to replicate the behavior of gluten, particularly in baking, require precision and analysis.

This is a basic Gluten-Free cookbook, not centered on baking, but since that is often the most difficult area to achieve satisfactory results, I focused on that part of the cookbook. So, at high-altitude - another baking challenge-- I tested two recipes. Note that recipes in most categories are included, and even if kept pretty basic, it is possible to use this book to cover most meals.

First, although not technically baking, but close - I prepared Buttermilk Waffles. I used the provided conversion measurements for the Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free (GF) all-purpose flour I had on hand, which luckily is one of the brands the ATK staff provided conversion measurements for from the GF mix custom developed for use with this cookbook.

The substitution recipe for buttermilk, which I did not have on-hand, also included in the book, called for one half cup milk and one and a quarter cup yogurt to replace the one and three-quarters cup of buttermilk in the recipe. This substitution worked perfectly. I made the waffles in a four square Belgian waffle maker KRUPS 654-75 Waffle Chef 4-Slice Belgian Waffle Maker with Nonstick Plates LED Indicator Lights and Stainless Steel Housing, Silver.

My usual recipe for that iron uses slightly less than one half cup of batter per square, and five minutes cook time. I changed nothing except switching to the batter from the ATK cookbook and the result was perfect. I tend to prefer Belgian waffles with a crispy exterior and this GF version came out of the iron just that way although after about five minutes they began to slightly soften, so they should be eaten quickly.

The flavor was fine although slightly bland and a bit salty even though I used unsalted butter and carefully measured the salt. The texture was a bit heavier than what I achieve with my non-GF batter, but no one would ever have known the waffles were GF. A really excellent result, but note that the recipe only made nine individual waffle squares although it contains half a stick of butter and three eggs. Normally I would have substituted to make it a little healthier, but the precision that went into every decision with the recipes precludes further experimentation. Still, it produced a really good waffle.

Next I prepared the Lemon Pound Cake. I changed nothing and the result was perfect with a finely textured crumb and a very lemony taste. I was tempted to make some adjustments for high altitude - things I normally do when baking, but decided to leave the recipe alone. No change was needed - the loaf baked beautifully, and like the waffles, no one would ever know it was a GF dessert. Note: most pound cakes are inherently pretty indulgent, and this one is no exception. One single 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 inch loaf pan required four eggs, one stick of butter and four ounces of cream cheese.

Regarding the construction of the book itself - it is a paperback and it is reluctant to lay open on the kitchen counter top, so a cookbook holder is helpful. It appears there is at least one photograph for every recipe, and often more than one. The ink color is mercifully black, which helps in reading the very small font size - I estimate it to be 9 point. The paper quality is good and a small spill, if wiped-up quickly, won't damage the page.

The results for the two recipes I prepared were exceptional which gives me confidence to try more. I plan on making the Nutella Tort and Chocolate Chip Cookies but decided against the pizza crust recipe because it must be partially baked before adding toppings and I did not want to bother. I will update if I encounter any problems, but as it stands, I am impressed."
2,"This is such an amazing cookbook. I have been gluten free because of a wheat allergy, for about 2 years. It has been a challenge to find things to bake/make that are not rubbery or super expensive. One of my favorite parts is in the beginning of the book gives a ""how to make your own GF flour"" recipe and it's EASY and wonderful. I have a grain mill, and have no problems milling my own rice to make this flour. It's wonderful that you can make extra and freeze it and then always have GF flour on hand at a much more affordable rate.
I was amazed at how awesome the waffles, crepes and cupcakes were. I made the cupcakes for a scout graduation ceremony to have a GF option on hand. They were red velvet and I had people coming up to me and asking for the recipe and was told twice, they were the BEST GF cupcakes ever. They were truly quite good. I love reading the backgrounds of how the recipes were developed, things like the orginal recipe called for two eggs but it made the GF version too dense etc. Then it showed how they had evolved and developed the recipes. I have not made the GF bread yet, but I know it will be amazing. I plan to make it this summer. THANK YOU for this incredible cookbook. I truly love it. I recently took it on vacation so i could read recipes on the car ride. Just saw there is a part two to this book, and I plan to obtain that too. Thank you America's Test Kitchen!"
2,"Finally! Gluten free recipes written with reason and science and not just a bunch of thrown together substitutions.
I was diagnosed with celiac 12 years ago. Until this cookbook came out I was doing the painstakingly slow method of converting my family recipes to gf via trial and error. Needless to say its been very frustrating and expensive.
While this cookbook has a lot of recipes that I would consider ""fluff"" food, mostly because of the white rice flour base, there are many segments explaining the why's and how's of baking gf that I was only subconsciously aware of through my experiences. I really enjoyed the buckwheat pancakes and the lemon bars. Now that Autumn is here I plan to make the cranberry nut muffins (before this cookbook came out I was planing on doing a gf version of this original ""Cook's Illustrated recipe because it uses pecan flour and not a lot of wheat flour) and the gingerbread cake.
Using their advice for successful cookie baking, I was able to convert a Cook's Country recipe for butterscotch cookies with one try! (Cut the butter by ~1/3, let dough rest to fully hydrate, add ~1/2 tsp xanthan gum, use a whole egg for added protein and not just a yolk etc).
I notice many reviewers complained about the non-nutritive nature of the flour blend. I can't eat white rice flour based baked goods every day and expect to be healthy, but if I'm occasionally going to eat chocolate cake, then I'll eat some and enjoy it. I never was a believer that putting whole grain flour into a cookie or a cake was going to magically transform it into a fountain of health. Nothing will change the fact that desserts are just that, an occasional treat and indulgence.
I do love my whole grain gluten free flours and miss the nutty, toasty flavor of whole wheat bread and rolls, I was disappointed to see a lack of recipes using whole grain gf flours until I saw on the Cook's Illustrated blog that they are developing the next gluten free cookbook dedicated to whole grain gluten free flours. I can't wait to pre-order the next one!"
2,"I don't even know where to begin this review of The How Can It Be Gluten Free Cookbook from the America's Test Kitchen gang. The thing that puts this above all the others is how they explain how they came up with the recipes and the issues they had with different ingredients including many of the available gluten free flours. One thing, in particular, I never understood until I received this book was the purpose of xanthan gum and how to use it properly (helps bind the recipe together). Before I even get to the recipes (extremely comprehensive), I want to note that I really appreciated how they took the time to test and review prepackaged gluten free products available in supermarkets (like bread, flour, and pasta, for example) and provide detailed information on taste, quality, ingredients, and their general assessment of each (usually correct). Also, they took the time to create an easy to mix blend of flour that seems to be a step above the available blends on the market, although King Arthur Gluten Free Flour seems to come closest to the ATK blend. They even show the differences by baking the same cupcake recipe with three different flours. Right now I'm using King Arthur flour but when I run out, I'll be making my own ATK blend.

Now, the recipes. This book has everything one could want from pancakes, breads, muffins, and pasta dishes to rice dishes, salads, meat and fowl preparation, and best of all, the dessert chapter. I've made several of the items in this cookbook including some of the pasta dishes. One thing I have found is that gluten free pasta has a harder, chewier texture than regular pasta but if the sauces are good and flavorful as the sauces are in this book, the texture of the pasta is virtually undetectable. I've made both the basil pesto and the putanesca recipes and they were outstanding. I also made the baked macaroni and cheese - also very outstanding.

Most of the recipes I've tried came from the dessert section and everything is amazing. I've served the lemon pound cake and the pignoli cookies to guests and didn't say they were gluten free and no one noticed. I am planning to try the pie crust next and later the bread (which, I'm always afraid of trying).

The only thing I would like to see from them going forward is a simple recipe for gluten free bread machine bread. That would be wonderful.

If you only get one gluten free cookbook, this really should be the one. It's extensive and educational and I am at a point where I feel like any recipe I try will be fantastic. The ATK folks really do know what they're doing. I have several other cookbooks by them and all are very high quality, comprehensive, and include real dishes people love.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
2,"I have to start this review by saying that I am a big fan of the America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated line of cookbooks. I appreciate the amount of testing they do to come up with the recipes they feel are the best. So I was glad that they tackled gluten-free cooking.

I normally think only of baking when I think about gluten, but there are a lot of recipes that use bread crumbs for coating fried chicken or chicken finger or the panade (bread & milk mixture) in meatloaf to keep it moist and tender. This cookbook has a chapter on the basics of gluten-free cooking; breakfast food recipes (pancakes, muffins, banana bread, cereals); recipes using different kinds of grain; pasta; comfort food (fried chicken, meatloaf, etc.); yeast breads, savory loaves & pizza; cookies and bars; pies, fruit desserts and tarts; and cakes.

The introductory chapter had evaluations of five widely available commercial gluten-free flour blends as well as the recipe for the America's Test Kitchen (ATK) flour blend used in the baking recipes. The ATK blend is primarily white and brown rice flour, potato starch and tapioca starch. For people who want to use a commercial GF flour blend, the recipes give substitution quantities for the King Arthur and Bob's Red Mill brand GF flour blends.

In addition, the intro chapter rated GF sandwich breads and pasta.

In addition to using the ATK blend, the recipes use slightly different mixing techniques than their wheat flour counterparts. For example, when making chocolate chip cookies, I would normally cream the butter and sugar, but the GF recipe calls for melting the butter and then letting the finished dough ""rest"" for 30 minutes to give the starches in their flour blend time to hydrate. Other recipes are made the same way as their wheat flour versions. The steps to make the banana bread recipe are just like the one I use from my other ATK cookbook (except this one doesn't use the sliced bananas on top).

I never realized how much more expensive gluten-free baking is. I went to the co-op with it's bulk bins to get the various ingredients for making the ATK flour blend and the xanthan gum called for in several recipes. It cost more than $15 for one batch (42 ounces) of the flour blend. Xanthan gum is around $30 a pound so unless you will be doing a lot of baking, try to find somewhere that sells just the amount you need and not have to buy the 8 oz. bag from Bob's Red Mill.
I thought the chapter on grains was unnecessary -- these are recipes one can find in other kinds of cookbooks.

This cookbook has a good variety of recipes for GF baked goods, along with a recipe for pasta dough and pizza dough. In the comfort foods chapter, there is a recipe for meatloaf, spaghetti & meatballs, eggplant parmesan, fried chicken, chicken fingers, and cornbread stuffing.

I didn't think the chapter on recipes for rice and other grains was strictly necessary as these grains are already gluten free and no changes were necessary.

I think this would be a good cookbook for someone who either can't tolerate wheat or gluten or who just wants to avoid it."
2,"After my adult son decided to eat only gluten free foods, he tried to convince me that I should do the same. But I resisted for 2 reasons: I didn't think gluten was a problem for me and cooking gluten free recipes seemed like it would be difficult. This book has completely changed my mind.

I especially like the fact that my family's favorite recipes can be adapted to gluten free versions without sacrificing taste. In fact, they actually like the fried chicken in this cookbook better than my old version! And the special Gluten Free Flour Blend is a winner. It has clearly been thoroughly tested to get ideal results.

I also appreciate the fact that the authors don't try to focus on foods which are already gluten free and throw a ton of recipes for them into this book. I've actually owned gluten free cookbooks which did that and it seemed a cheat. Who needs basic recipes for vegetables, chicken and beef? They are already gluten free! The authors do include some recipes for meats which normally have breading and tweak them. That's fine by me.

I was especially skeptical about whether foods like pizza and bread could actually taste good without gluten. But they can -and do. Another unexpected plus in ditching the gluten? Weight loss. My son lost 30 pounds without even trying and that was a good thing because he wanted to lose weight. I had equally good results, dropping some extra pounds and I feel healthier than ever."
2,"This is one of the best gluten free cookbooks (Volume 2 is the other) I've used. I cannot eat gluten or corn so my bread choices are very limited - their classic sandwich bread is awesome - it's similar to the homemade wheat bread I remember. My husband (who is not gluten- or corn-free) agrees. The Millet-Cherry Almond and blueberry muffins are awesome also. Their baked goods do not have the crumbly, dry, sometimes pasty/gummy texture of a lot of gluten free recipes. I've also tried many of their other recipes and I haven't hit one I don't like. I baked the sugar cookies for my church's Christmas cookie walk and they were a hit. I have to do some substitutions because I can't have corn but can use most of the recipes. I'm so glad they came out with this one!"
2,"I don't know about you but I want to serve more gluten free meals. I don't believe that anyone in our family has an intolerance for gluten, but I do think the American diet is a little gluten heavy.

There are two reasons I haven't implemented my plan previously. The first reason is simple and not really a huge contributing factor. Truth is, I'm an little timid to get started. I've always cooked and baked with flour and the idea of ruminating off into new, unexplored territory is a little intimidating. The second reason though is the biggest problem. And that is that when I stand up and wander about the kitchen, thinking about what to make for dinner, my mind goes blank and I can't think of something gluten free to make. (Stupid I know, but I'm being honest.) THAT'S WHY I LOVE this book from American's Test Kitchen. It's there to give me ideas for every meal, and it serves to give me 'idiot proof' instructions that give me confidence.

WHAT YOU GET -- Ingredients and what not
****************************************
At the beginning of the book there is a section about what Flour actually does in cooking --think Alton Brown science approach-- and then there is a discussion of what the Kitchen folk had to look for to overcome the lack of flour stickiness.

You don't need to read the above material but I thought it was interesting. What I do suggest you read is the section on EVALUATING COMMERCIAL FLOUR BLENDS. On this page they compare Bob's GF Baking Flour with King Arthurs's, Pamela's and others.

THEN they give their own formula. And using White Rice flour, brown rice flour, potato and tapioca starch with a little nonfat milk powder --we can make our own blend.

What's really cool is that they then show us a muffin made with their GF flour mix and King Arthur's and Bob's. They don't look the same.

From there they compare other ingredients and even store bought bread. I appreciated this a lot.

WHAT YOU GET -- Recipes
****************************************
THE GOOD
I love The American's Test Kitchen recipes. They start off with a section about ""Why This Recipe Works"". I like this because it helps me figure out if it's a recipe I want to try right away.

Then there's the instructions. They are VERY thorough. Though I've cooked for decades, when I try something new I prefer to be 'over-taught' rather than to have to guess what a procedure should feel like.

The Variations that they offer are great. If I see something that my kids aren't crazy about, I'll look there for substitution ideas.

Finally, I like the Smart Shopping tips. This are suggestions for what to look for quinoa, for example, or rice. If there is a name brand they like, they aren't hesitant to use it.

THE NOT SO GOOD
My husband and I are currently on a diet. And what I never noticed before is that there are no calorie estimates. I know I can calculate them, but I never noticed that the Test Kitchen doesn't include an estimate. It would be good to have a vague idea so that I could easily eliminate items that are high calorie.

~~

I really like this cookbook. It has recipes for all occasions and it has a lot of advice on what to buy and how to prepare. The color photos of the finished foods are scrumptious, and I love that there are variations for all the recipes so that if I want to substitutions I don't have to wrack my brain.

The only downside I've found to this book is that there are no calorie estimates. Obviously not a problem for most folks, but if you are on a diet, it makes for a little extra work."
2,"Best gluten free chocolate cupcakes I've ever had! Tonight I made the pasta dough and it was hard to work with, but delicious! Well worth the effort. Looking forward to trying a lot more! The recipes are easy to follow and I love all the information they give you on why it works. I'd definitely recommend it!

Update: the multi grain bread is the best gluten free bread I've ever had and makes a fantastic French toast. Also, the chocolate chip cookies are amazing! Brought them to a kids party yesterday and they went fast!

I use a food sale to weigh out the flours into a ziplock bag and shake it up to combine. It's very simple to weigh it all out, so don't be put off by the list of ingredients. It is well worth the effort! I actually bagged up all the dry ingredients to make another batch of cookies next week for a birthday party. I keep the flours in the freezer."
2,"If you are going gluten-free to follow a diet like paleo, this cookbook is not for you. The chefs at ATC are attempting to replicate some classics that rely on white flour so don't expect that the recipes are ""healthier"" in some way. That being said, I think they are pretty successful in creating recipes that closely mimic those with gluten. It is a typical ATC book - heavy on the details, but the recipes work. They provide a ""recipe"" for a flour blend that they use for the recipes (which is nice considering how pricey gluten-free flour mixes are!) but also provide info on how the recipe will work with a couple of other blends. The waffles and buttermilk pancake recipes in this book were great - I think the pancakes were the best I have ever made. I also love the mac and cheese recipe in here. The pizza crust recipe is also really good as are the chocolate chip cookies, granola, and granola bar recipes. The banana bread recipe was time consuming and I didn't feel like it was quite worth the effort, so I will keep looking there. Overall if you want to make traditional recipes as gluten free this is a great book."
2,"I may be the best, or the worst, person to review this book.

I love cooking and enjoy the America's Test Kitchen approach. I have no gluten allergies to speak of, nor do any of the members of my immediate family. However, I'm a big fan of ""moderation in everything,"" so I'm interested in what it takes to reduce the massive amounts of gluten that we consume.

Rather than simply substituting gluten free flours for the wheat flours in recipes, the team at America's Test Kitchen examined several different types of recipes and identified the purpose of gluten in each of them. From there, they devised different gluten-free solutions that provided the same or similar properties. Some recipes don't contain gluten in their common preparation anyway, and are included in the book to remind us that some options are available without any additional work :)

I suggest everyone read the first 30 pages (The Basics of Gluten Free Cooking) straight through. There is quite a bit of good information and general guidance in those pages, and the information presented here is utilized in the recipes. This first section discusses different gluten free ingredients like almond flour, xanthan gum and tapioca starch as well as some common classes of products (bread, noodles, grains). Each recipe has a ""Why This Recipe Works"" section that explains the role gluten plays in the original recipe and how their implementation provides similar results -- from a scientific perspective -- and having this foundation helps understand what they're taking about in those sections.

In reality, many of their recipes are really two recipes in one because most recipes that contain flour are written using a store-bought gluten-free flour mixture, or their custom mix which is created from fairly common ingredients. Believe it or not, each store-bought gluten-free flour mixture behaves differently, so you have to be careful not just in your selection, but with measurement as well: just about none of them are a cup-for-cup replacements.

I learned a lot by reading this book and have bookmarked many recipes for my family to try.

I particularly enjoyed the ""Recipe Lab"" sections that discuss specific problems and how the team developed solutions to those problems. As an example, how do you create a coffee cake when the gluten free cake batter collapses under the weight of the topping? Part of the answer is to wait until the cake has cooked and can maintain its structure..."
2,"This cookbook starts out with in-depth discussion of why gluten is used in various ways when cooking, and the mechanisms behind why it works in the way it does. It also explains why it is so hard to replace it in your cooking, and why a one to one replacement with some other type of flour does not really work. I found it really helpful to understand the mechanics behind gluten replacement, and why their recipes worked.

It also had straightforward reviews of various gluten-free products, which were the best, and which were utter failures. The comparisons included exact descriptions of the strengths and shortcomings of each product. The flour replacement discussion included pictures of various goods made with the products, which made the differences easy to understand.

The recipes are heavy geared toward comfort foods, baking, breaded items, and dessert recipes, which is understandable to me as a Celiac. I don't need recipes for salad or grilled chicken; those type of foods are simple to adapt for a gluten free diet. What is very difficult, and America's Test Kitchen has done a heroic job of working out, is how to make decent breads, pasta, pie crusts, desserts, meat coatings, etc.

The recipes also go very in-depth into the actual techniques of making each product, crucial as it can be very different from the way you'd normally process the same items made with wheat flour. One example of this that stands out to me is making the top crust for a pot pie, and par-baking it on a sheet, then placing it on the pie for a short period of finish baking it all together. It had never occurred to me to try this, and it was a revelation!

I highly recommend this book, and must say that to get the utmost value from it, you should sit down and read the first chapters before moving on to tackling the recipes, as the new understanding it gives you will greatly increase your chances of not only successfully cooking from their recipes, but of being able to convert your own favorites to a gluten free version."
2,"I'm not gluten free myself, but in the course of my business, I do cook for a lot of people with special diets, including gluten free, and I'm always looking for good all around recipes that won't make me feel like I'm punishing my other guests. Consequently, there are a lot if gf cookbooks in my library--including a few stinkers. What I like about this cookbook is that they don't waste a bunch of space including recipes that are inherently gluten free already. Instead, the concentrate on producing the best gluten free version of recipes that you would normally only be able to pull off with wheat.

Add to that the always-reliable, well-tested, reproducible America's Test Kitchen recipes, with excellent product and tool reviews, and this is a fine addition to any gluten free cooking library.

Anyone can swap out store-bought gf flour in their standard recipes and get a passable if lackluster approximation, but but the Test Kitchen cooks figure out what's lacking & fix it. The book even starts with a little science behind each of the common uses for wheat flour, and the pitfalls you encounter when replacing them (which helped me understand both by successful and failed gf attempts). It continues with all those mysterious substitutes, thickeners & binders. And of course, their recipe for all-purpose, gluten-free flour (no super-exotic ingredients and WAY cheaper than store bought blends. Recipes are tested with their blend and the top 2 commercial blends (bob's & king arthur)

Recipes include everything from sandwich breads to cakes, pie crust, cookies, fried chicken and pork chops, and pasta. The recipes I've tried have been easy to follow and successful."
2,"I've tried a bunch of recipes from this book, and everything works. The breads are amazing, so much better than any store bought GF bread, and better than any regular store bought sliced bread I had before celiac. We keep a sliced loaf in the freezer at all times. Putting a square of parchment paper between each slice before putting the loaf in the freezer keeps the slices from sticking together and makes it easy to pull out and thaw one or two slices at a time.

The coffee cake and pound cake recipes are so good that people can't tell they're gluten free. Haven't tried the mac and cheese yet, but am really looking forward to it.

I like that their flour blend is composed of things my local grocery store carries. If I run out of something in the middle of a recipe, I don't have to go far to restock."
2,"I'm not sure if I love this book enough to buy it because only 8 recipes really speak to me. Today I made the Gingerbread Cake using their suggested flour made from white rice flour, brown rice flour, potato starch, tapioca starch and nonfat milk. Because I have quite a collection of non-gluten flours I had everything on hand except the dry milk, others who are just getting their feet wet in gluten-free baking may find the ingredients daunting but the mix made an excellent cake, baked in a bundt pan as ATK recommends. Light, high-rising, moist, not heavy at all as some GF cakes can be.

If gluten-free is your only intolerance this would be a good book to start with. However I have other food intolerances (luckily milk is not one) so many of the recipes are useless for me. Other reviewers pointed out they cannot tolerate milk so if you are one too don't buy this book because the flour recipe always has dry milk and is necessary.

One dissatisfaction I have is that the authors really hype Bob's Red Mills products. They are fine but certainly not the only good GF choices. I understand they want to suggest products easily found in stores but it's pretty easy to order from other manufacturers on Amazon. In fact most of my GF flours are not Bob's.

I'll try a few more recipes from the book before deciding to buy (my copy came from the library.)"
2,"This is the kind of thing that America's Test Kitchen excels at, and I'm somewhat surprised they didn't make it a Best Recipe book. This book is a mixture of the obvious baking recipes with dishes like Pad Thai and shepherd's pie that are either easily converted to gluten-free or never needed gluten-containing products in the first place.

There's a lot of corn and rice in here, as well as evaluations of various kinds of gluten-free flour; ATK provides their own, plus recommendations for King Arthur Flour and Bob's Red Mill's products, along with extensive use of cornstarch, tapioca, and potato starch when flour protein isn't needed. It also goes into some detail on binders to replace gluten, including xanthan gum and psyllium.

But the best thing about it is what it doesn't do -- it doesn't pander to the fad dieters. It doesn't obsess over GMOs or throw fits over nutritional pseudoscience. (Another reviewer pointed out a lack of nutritional information, which is important for diabetics; this is actually a serious enough omission for a book about a medical diet to dock a star.) As with many ATK books, it's a must-read for people interested in kitchen science, and you might even find a few gems, like the skillet cornbread I once recommended to a friend of mine with celiac."
2,"I finally broke down and purchase everything needed for the ATK Flour blend recipe in this book. I made the pull-apart rolls as my ""litmus test"" and OH MY GOODNESS!! They seemed a little dense (have to cook them a little longer next time) but when I bit into it, I think the heavens opened up and I was transported to eating a sweet gluten roll from years ago. I'm ready to make all the bread products now! I've made a few other recipes that if you follow the notes and the recipe as noted, you will be very happy with the results. My picky daughter LOVED the rolls and everything else I've made from this cook book. THANK YOU AMERICA'S TEST KITCHEN for thinking of us gluten free people!! :)"
2,"I am so grateful for this book. Diagnosed last year with gluten intolerance I began trying all the gluten-free products. Most were inedible. Finally, just worked out menus that were safe and good but they did not include all the tasty favorites of mine. Purchased 11 gluten free cookbooks and was not happy with any of them. When Cooks Illustrated announced their release of this book I had to think really hard about buying another cookbook for the shelf. Best decision I could have made. I have donated all the others. This is the only GF cookbook I need. I am a happy baker again and eating delicious meals. I especially love the cornbread recipe which makes the best cornbread I have ever eaten (toasting the cornmeal brings out the flavor). The hands down prize is the GF flour recipe which is fantastic. I can make gravy, cakes and biscuits again. Thank you Cooks Illustrated!!"
2,"This is the best book I've ever read on Gluten Free cooking.
This is much more than a recipe book, this is a comprehensive study of gluten free cooking. In order to have successful gluten free recipes, you have to understand the science behind gluten free cooking, and this book clearly and easily lays this out. Our family has multiple food allergies: Gluten, dairy protein, soy, and peanut/tree nut. Prior to reading this book I was trying to make food that all of us could eat, and the results weren't always the best. Now that I understand how each of these ingredients work in the recipes I have been coming up with some really tasty gluten/dairy/soy/nut free treats that are moist, not crumbly, and taste great. Understanding how eggs, fat, and protein are essential in GF cooking has made that possible.
Also, the authors give very helpful tips in making substitutions in the recipes easy to do, and the comparison of available gluten free products is very helpful.
I have not tried the master recipe as it requires either dairy or soy, but I have been able to adapt the recipes using my other GF flours.
I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who cooks gluten free."
2,"Like most America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, this book not only gives your recipes, it also explains why the recipe contains the ingredients that it does and why other ingredients were not used. This information is: (1) often fascinating and (2) practical, because it helps you avoid the ""mistakes"" America's Test Kitchen has already made.

I need pictures in a cookbook to inspire me, and this book meets that need. The photos in this book were in color and were appealing.

The book discusses various pre-mixed gluten-free products on the market and compares them. It candidly gives preferences and the reasons behind those preferences. This information alone will save you real money and disappointment.

The book does not ""over-sale"" its recipes. It tells the reader which recipes are really good and which are merely good enough.

I recommend this book to anyone who lives gluten-free."
2,"Want the short review? Very impressed....very, very impressed! Definitely worth every penny!

Want a review that's a wee bit longer? Then here it is......................Considering that this is coming from one of the best ""companies"" out there, I was not disappointed in the contents of this gluten-free (GF) cookbook; their name is the golden hint. Christopher Kimball and company have been presenting the best in science and taste for cooking and baking for many years. This latest foray into GF cooking/ baking has made for confident baking as the specifics of using GF flours can be a real challenge for anyone, let alone finding the taste factor. This book has made the effort of trial and error, as well having answered the questions involved in finding palatable GF food. If you have the desire to read the specifics of this GF science, the information is here, otherwise you can go directly to the recipes and move along.

Now, just to qualify this, I have to say that I also attended a presentation during the book tour for this newest offering, with ATK's very own Jack Bishop. (I don't know him, I don't own stock in the company, but I trust Chris Kimball). I was impressed with everything because the science in this part of food life, has really taken off but where does one start? Who can you trust to have real knowledge? For those who are celiac's, just a puff of wheat in their food can make the difference between having a meal and visiting the ER......no kidding.

This is a rather heavy book of recipes and education and information. There are 328 total book pages, with recipes that have accompanying color (mostly) photo's of everything. There are 9 chapters that are specific to the cooking/baking recipes but there are 13 chapters in all, ranging from the ""Welcome"" to ""The Basics of GF Cooking"" to ""Conversions and Equivalents"" to ""Weight-to-Volume Equivalencies"" meaning the ratio of using other GF flours. They discuss how they developed the flour blends and proportions, the science and art behind it, using other ingredients that help to balance out taste and function (such as binders, substitutes, etc), and the ratings of how they determined the flavor value; all this neatly tucked in between the book covers.

Here are some tidbits of information that Jack Bishop made:

Depending on the company from which you purchase your GF flour, you need to SCALE everything (meaning you need to use a measuring scale) as the weights vary and will greatly affect the flavor and taste and density of the food. Both the companies and the weights are given.

It took 2 months of testing, retesting, and more retesting to find the perfect flour blend, all in the hallowed halls of America's Test Kitchen. I greatly suggest to just stick with their flour blend as the ingredients are easy to find, in both health food stores and gratefully, in more mainstream grocery chains.

In using ""binders"", xanthum gum if good for cookies, and psyllium is best for bread (think in the line of Metamucil!) but that guar gum is less desirable for GF baking.

Having said all this, Mr. Bishop did say that the response to this book was so great, that they are in the process of working on a GF book dedicated to all baking. He said that desserts tend to be most difficult for GF/Celiacs to deal with as most desserts are made with varying wheat flours, and just the thought of being able to have just an Ã©clair or slice of ""real"" cake, would be a joy for many people (even for those who choose a GF diet).

I have made many recipes from this book, including making some for others who had no idea that it was GF; I was never disappointed nor did I receive any complaints (actually, with the recipes that were baked, there were rave reviews, and have since passed along this book to others). I truly salute the folks at America's Test Kitchen for their diligence and hardwork; both my abdomen and I thank you!"
2,"I have nicknamed this book my ""gluten free bible"".... Every recipe I've tried from this book or it's sequel has come out amazingly, in the four years I've been using it. The trick is to follow the recipe exactly because the writers really have perfected them. I swear the food tastes better than the classic gluten filled version, most of the time.

I reccomend this book to any new gluten-free friends I make."
2,"As someone following the Mediterranean diet, and also avoiding glutens, I found this to be a treasure. American's Test Kitchen is a great resource. They experiment with many variations of a recipe, determining what works best. I love that they explain why they do what they do. It lets easily apply that info to other, similar, recipes.

This book basically offers 2 types of recipes. Those using whole grains (which is why I love it) and those using a gluten-free flour mix (either the one ATK developed or a commercial mix). Since I largely avoid rice, and the ATK flour mix is mainly rice flour, I haven't used those recipes.

Oh, but the whole grain recipes are wonderful. First, the book starts out explaining about a wide variety of gluten-free grains. Then we learn a vast variety of ways to use them. This is the best resource I have found for gluten-free, whole grain recipes. Highly recommended to anyone following the Mediterranean diet and a great introduction to whole grains for those who would like to add them to their diet!"
2,"I have both volumes 1 & 2 and swear by them. Gluten-free living is not for those with a passing curiosity. It's a necessity and lots of work for the rest of us and we have to make so many things from scratch because wheat flour is cheap and works for everything from breads to thickeners to derivatives used in many favorite packaged and canned foods. ATK has made all the mistakes and explains why theirs failed or succeeded - I like that. So far, all other books fall short of what true gluten-free baked goods taste, perform and feel like when you bite into them. All gluten-free breads fall short performing like their gluten-containing cousins. It's simply science. But, ATK has nailed their flour blends performance, taste and texture."
2,"This book is EXCELLENT for treats.
I just made the pumpkin bread and it is honestly the best pumpkin bread I've ever made. Beats any coffeeshop hands down!
We've made several of the breakfast recipes (waffles, pancakes, muffins) and have really enjoyed them. The waffles are especially crispy and light, which is so nice.
The reviews of different blends and flours and other necessities are great, and the science tidbits (for instance, what xanthan gum does) are very nice. As someone who has always enjoyed baking, it's really a learning tool for me, and I appreciate that these bits are included in the book.
However, as a family that has made the journey into real, more whole, foods over the course of the past several years, I have to say this book is going to be a go-to only for special occasions. The recipes may be tasty (which is awesome for a birthday cake, or a special breakfast when you want a little more of that ""coffeeshop"" feel) but they really aren't terribly nutritious. The blend bakes up beautifully, but is largely white rice flour.
It is also importnant to note that the authors were looking to accomplish only a single goal, to remove gluten. So this book will not work well for anoyone who needs to remove multiple foods (there is a lot of dairy, and plenty of eggs.)
Some of the recipes can be a bit tedious, though they are very well written, easy to follow and well photographed. There are some things that might be tough for beginners in the kitchen.
All in all, I really like this book a lot, but I just can't give it the full 5-star score. The nutrition just seems lacking a little too much. Its a great addition to my cookbook shelf and its a great place to learn a bit more about gluten free baking, but it's not a great everday cookbook."
2,"I rarely write reviews. No time! But I had to for this book. I can only write about the recipes Iâ€™ve tried so, if you try anything at all, the buttermilk pancakes are AMAZING! Fluffy and light and sooo good. BUT... trust me on this: use Bobâ€™s red mill 1-1 Baking mix. I tried the recipe with this the very first time. Loved them. Then I tried their own ATK blend. Awful! Tried it twice thinking I made them wrong. Not good, totally flat. Tried again with Bobâ€™s Red Mill 1-1 and AMAZING again! Sticking to this flour.
I made the lemon pound cake with ATK blend and that is amazing also sooooo good!! Havenâ€™t tried Bobs Red Mill with this particular recipe but I will! Chocolate chip cookies and peanut butter cookies are great also. Iâ€™m going to keep trying!"
2,"So pleased that this gluten free cookbook is out. I love the explanations and guidelines that this cookbook offers. Impressed with their trials and pictures of how things turn out with varied ""flours"". Such a ""gift"" for those of us that must be gluten free! I've purchased other Gluten Free cookbooks and this is undoubtedly my favorite! Looking forward to America's Test Kitchen putting out future gluten free cookbooks. Many things that I want to try first, in this cookbook. Great ease of use and so understandable. I'm not a ""fancy"" cookbook user and this one fits the bill for me. It seems like so many GF recipes and cookbooks also go vegetarian and dairy free. That wasn't what I was looking for so quite pleased that this one primarily deals with the gluten issue and leaves the rest alone. This could be one's ""only"" cookbook and would please everyone with it's selections...be they gluten free or not."
2,"I went gluten-free several months ago, and it was a challenge to say the least. I wish this book had been out then, but I'm still very glad it's out now! I had already picked up a few GF cookbooks but when this one became available through Vine, I grabbed it. I didn't realize it was from America's Test Kitchen until I got it. My confidence in the book shot straight through the roof; I know how serious they are about testing their recipes, as a former neighbor was one of their at-home test chefs.

I was not disappointed. The book begins with a very well-written explanation of what gluten is and how it works, and why most gluten-free products are dry, grainy and just plain unpalatable. They tested numerous existing recipes with various GF flours already on the market, and although they liked King Arthur's all-purpose GF flour and Bob's Red Mill, neither were perfect for every type of recipe. So they created their own blend and tested each recipe with all three flours, tweaking repeatedly as they went.

They also tasted and tested several GF pastas and breads. I have tried a few of the ones they tested and completely agreed with their assessments. I hadn't found a brown rice pasta I liked and have been using the new Mueller's and Barilla brands (which are not discussed in the book, since they just came out and the book was likely already at press), but they use white rice flour. I'm hypoglycemic and would prefer brown rice. Now I have a new brand to try. They also discuss in detail various product substitutes and how different ingredients impact a recipe. With this information, I feel well-prepared to try to tweak some of my favorite recipes to make them gluten-free.

Here's what's really amazing: for EACH recipe, they describe it in detail, explain why it works, talk about substitutions, and give you step-by-step instructions. Some recipes take up four pages, but you'll never have to guess what you're doing. You will have complete confidence that the recipe will work out, because they were so thoroughly tested and because they walk you through it (I had mostly stopped buying cookbooks because I preferred to read reviews for recipes online, but with ATK, you know they've already gone through numerous modifications to make them just right). They didn't include too many main dishes, particularly meat or chicken dishes, because many of them are GF to begin with, and if you need to swap regular flour for GF flour in your own recipes, they have tips for that. So they focused on baked goods, side dishes, breakfast, and other items that those of us who avoid gluten normally can't eat (or have suffered through icky GF versions of).

I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is THE gluten-free cookbook to buy, period. If you're just starting out, getting a guide to help you navigate the GF diet would be wise (I borrowed the Complete Idiots guide from a neighbor and found it so useful, I'll be buying the new edition). But once you're ready to start cooking GF from scratch, this is the book you want. I've been glad to find ready-made GF packaged goods for easy risottos and flavored quinoa blends, but this book is the first one that makes me excited to truly cook gluten-free.

My only complaint? No French bread/baguette recipe. Perhaps that's asking too much, for there to be a quality GF baguette recipe, but I figure if anyone could do it, America's Test Kitchen could. So I'm bummed not to have one, as I love baking baguettes from scratch. Something to keep in mind for the Web site, ATK folks??? Please?! Don't make me cheat!!"
2,"I've just begun to cook from this cookbook. The banana bread is to die for! The recipe appears to have many steps when you read it through, but after making it a few times it isn't that complicated. I have a gluten sensitivity but my husband does not. I think he eats more of this banana bread than I do. I have made it with 3 different GF flour mixes and they all seem to work well.

I plan on trying the English muffin recipe next. I also like to read about the science and history behind a recipe, so this cookbook is a real winner."
2,"I have a gluten intolerance and have established a gluten free diet for a number of years. In that same period, I began to take an interest in cooking. Having established a gluten free diet can be troubling for anyone who enjoys baked goods as the overwhelming majority of such recipes require flour. Finding alternatives can also be difficult. Many cookbooks offer recipes that substitute the wheat-based flours for flours based on coconut or some combination of ground nuts. While these recipes can often by tasty and fulfilling, they offer something that is different from the recipes we have come to know and love.

The How Can It Be Gluten Free Cookbook offers a scientific look into how wheat-based flour works and how to find alternatives ingredients and cooking techniques to recreate the foods of the past in a form that is nearly identical to its glutinous counterparts. I was never aware of how many caveats there were to trying 1-1 replacements of gluten free flour with wheat flour in traditional recipes, but this book underscores the variance and provides solutions to overcoming them. The results are nothing short of miraculous. I have made around 15-20 recipes in this book and have been disappointed with virtually none of them.

Many of the recipes in here are taken directly from other America's Test Kitchen cookbooks or their Cooks Illustrated magazine and adjusted to make them work with gluten-free flour substitutes. But they have done a fine job with the adaptation. My only complaint is that I wish it were bigger! Perhaps a volume 2 will be released in the near future. This is truly a must buy for anyone on a gluten free diet who wants to perfect the art of gluten-free cooking/baking."
2,"I'm fairly new to gluten-free (GF) cooking and baking, although I've checked out several GF cookbooks from the library the last couple of years. I recently entered the world of GF baking with Nosh on This: Gluten-Free Baking from a Jewish-American Kitchen, which served as an excellent primer for why GF flours and doughs react differently than their gluten-containing counterparts. I also learned how to create my own GF all-purpose mix using the recommended Authentic Foods Superfine White Rice Flour - 3lb and Authentic Foods Gluten Free Brown Rice Flour Superfine -- 3 lbs; I was surprised to see that Authentic Foods was not one of the reviewed/featured flour brands in the America's Test Kitchen book as they have received many excellent reviews from GF bakers. Naturally, I jumped at the chance of reviewing the ""How Can It Be Gluten-Free Cookbook"" as I am a fan of America's Test Kitchen and was looking for ideas for more gluten-free vegetarian dishes (The Gluten-Free Vegetarian Kitchen: Delicious and Nutritious Wheat-Free, Gluten-Free Dishes is also a great book).

The book starts off with brief overviews of the science of gluten, strategies for replacing wheat flour, a handy baking troubleshooting guide, choosing (or making) a GF all-purpose blend, a taste test of commercial GF flour blends, ATK's recipe for their all-purpose blend (unlike ""Nosh on This,"" ATK uses the addition of nonfat milk powder to aid in browning, along with potato and tapioca starch), how to measure GF flours (they recommend weighing rather than volume), the use of binders, substitutions, and the gluten-free pantry, including reviews of commercial GF sandwich bread (seven of the eight received ""recommended with reservations"" or ""not recommended"") and gluten-free pastas; not surprisingly, the corn spaghetti and pasta scored the lowest. I liked their tip that rice noodles should NOT be cooked according to package instructions as they will fall apart; instead, it is recommended to soak them under very hot tap water for 20-45 minutes depending on the type of noodle. And be careful when purchasing soba, as not all soba is 100% buckwheat but may contain a mix of flours (I use Eden Foods - Buckwheat Soba Pasta - 8 oz.). I also appreciated the in-depth guide (with photos) on the various types of whole grains, including rice as well as buckwheat, oat groats, millet and quinoa. Several methods are given for cooking grains: the pasta method, absorption method, and pilaf method. A chart explains which cooking methods are suited to which grains.

Beginning with breakfast, you'll find fluffy GF pancakes, waffles, crepes, quick breads, muffins, and coffee cake. I loved their quick method for steel-cut oats; because of the long cooking time, I never make them on weekdays, but here you boil the water, add the oats and let sit overnight. The next morning, you add additional liquid (milk, water, or juice depending on the variation) and reheat for 5-6 minutes. I tried several of the grain salads, including the wild rice pilaf with pecans and cranberries and the oat berry pilaf with walnuts and gorgonzola. I really enjoyed the blend of flavors and textures, especially the oat berry pilaf. I want to try the quinoa patties with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes at a later date as those also look promising.

Huge bonus points for including a chapter on making fresh GF pasta; this is the first GF cookbook I've seen that actually walks you through the steps, run the dough through your pasta machine and cut/shape your dough. I wasn't as impressed with the small variety of pasta sauces to go with commercial GF pasta (ATK's top pick was Jovial Brand) and would recommend Italian Classics (Best Recipe) instead. I loved the Asian-inspired noodle dishes like soba noodles with roasted eggplant and spicy basil noodles with crispy tofu.

The breads chapter makes the curious omission of not mentioning that gluten-free bread pans do exist; King Arthur Flour sells one made by USA Pan that is essentially a USA Pans 9 x 4 x 4 Inch Pullman, Aluminized Steel with Americoat minus lid. Gluten-free loaves need more support while baking, so a tall, narrow pan is better suited to this than a traditional loaf pan. Instead, ATK recommends the fussy process of making a foil collar similar to a souffle. I was pleased to see more international influences in the form of Soca (chickpea crepes from Southern France), arepas, pupusas, and pao de queijo.

The desserts chapters deserve special mention for their inclusion of elegant tarts (Nutella, Lemon, Rustic Walnut), gratins, pavlovas, and cakes. At the very back is a conversions and equivalencies chart and a weight-to-volume equivalencies for GF flours.

Overall, ""How Can It Be Gluten-Free"" sticks to ATK's standard format of lavishly illustrated product reviews, an ample description of why a given recipe works (and the food science behind it), and several variations for most dishes. I did find that there were far fewer bakeware recommendations (like the curious omission of the gluten-free loaf pan, or their take on whether silicone bakeware would work well for GF muffins, etc.). Each baked good comes with a handy chart with substitution instructions for commercial GF blends by Bob's Red Mill GF All-Purpose Blend and King Arthur Gluten-Free Multi-Purpose Flour, which is very handy if that's all you have on hand and time is short. There are plenty of variations (and international influences) to keep you happily experimenting for weeks (or months) to come. This is certainly a book I will find myself using on a regular basis, particularly for the many great meatless options, and a worthy addition to your gluten-free kitchen."
2,"As a long-time fan of ATK & their cookbooks & magazines, I was excited when this book was published. I couldn't wait to see if I could finally make a gluten free bread that would be worthy of being called bread (and please my non-gfree hubby who sacrifices daily for my food restrictions).

The first recipe I tackled, however, was the Shepherd's Pie. It was absolutely perfect - so delicious my 4-year old grand daughter asked for seconds, which was near on to miraculous.

Next up was the Carrot Cake for Easter. There was a very high bar to reach with this one, as my younger sister makes the best Carrot Cake I've ever tasted, but not GFree. I sat down with her and reviews the recipe and she nodded her head a lot, but suggested the addition of some crushed pineapple. I didn't eat the cake to be over moist or over sweet, so while I added 1/2 cup of partially drained crushed pineapple, I cut 3/8 cup of oil & 2 oz of sugar. I dare anyone to tell the differed between my sister's cake and mine. My brother-in-law, who eschews all things gluten free, ate 3 pieces!

I finally got to my true goal - the Multigrain bread. I admit I had to go out and buy a couple of ingredients that, amazingly, are not stocked in the ""flour refrigerator"" (psyllium his powder & mighty tasty hot cereal). My husband commented to me that the bread seemed to be a lot of work. I laughed and told him he had obviously never made bread. This bread is easy and relatively quick (compared to a yeasted gluten bread). Best of all, it is delicious! It's moist, airy crunchy and my husband said that if I hadn't told him he wouldn't have known it was gfree. It has held up nicely (wrapped as instructed) for 3 days, slices beautifully, has a lovely crust with a tender crumb. Really great bread. We will be premixing batches of the dry ingredients to make it a bit quicker to make loaves in the future.

Thank you, America's Test Kitchen, for doing the research and hard work so I can make great food so easily.

P.S. How about a gluten free French Bread recipe?"
2,"I have used this cookbook more than I have ever used any other cookbook, ever. More than The Moosewood Restaurant cookbook in those years after I first graduated from college and had no idea how to cook anything. More than The Family Dinner which helps me figure out what in the heck to make for our family when I run out of inspiration (or my kids decide they're sick of my go-tos).

We have made the apple crumble (several times), the cornbread, the peanut butter cookies, the chocolate cake (several times) and the icing. I'm making the bell pepper quinoa salad this week. It's just that everything you make tastes so great. There are no clunkers. I have never been that much of a Cook's Illustrated fan before -- I'm more of a ""eyeball it"" kind of a cook and thus far, not much of a baker. This book makes baking fan because everything you make tastes great.

I will say it's more of a baking cookbook. There are not a ton of dinner options, although there are some good-looking pastas and a couple of casseroles. I think I'll try tamale pie next, it's getting to be that kind of weather."
2,"American Test kitchen has developed a new way to cook without gluten, reinventing the rules so your food will actually taste good. Included are recipes (with pictures showing you various steps of the process) for such things as lasagna, pasta, cakes and breads.

Their recipe relies on white rice, brown rice, potato starch, tapioca starch, and non fat milk.

For the curious, here is the recipe, but buy the book:

24 ounces (4 1/2 cups plus 1/3 cup) white rice flour
7 1/2 ounces (1 2/3 cups) brown rice flour
7 ounces (1 1/3 cups) potato starch
3 ounces (3/4 cup) tapioca starch
3/4 ounce (3 tablespoons) nonfat milk powder

Book is 336 pages with 118 recipes"
2,"I got this book somewhere else because I didn't know Amazon had it. It was written in 2014 so it is very up to date. Almost every recipe is my favorite. Best muffins and waffles and pie crusts. Also they review several gluten free products on the market right now and the types of flours, such as which store bought breads are best. They also have made up their own flour mix to use in the recipes in the book and I just stick to that since so many recipe's in the book turn out so well. I do a lot of my own baking so I know how this compares to other things I bake."
2,"The people at ATK have done it again! This is a terrific cookbook/manual of Gluten free cooking and most of the recipes are excellent! I have been trying out the recipes for a little over a month now and have had mostly successes!

My previous resource for GF cooking and flour blend was the book 'Cooking for Isaiah'Cooking for Isaiah: Gluten-Free & Dairy-Free Recipes for Easy Delicious Meals 1st (first) Edition by Nardone, Silvana published by Readers Digest (2010) Hardcover
The similarities between the ATK blend and the Nardone blend are pretty big but the ATK flour blend includes dry milk powder which really does make a difference. Yes, this means the recipes are not dairy free but people with Celiac need to avoid gluten, not dairy and not nuts and not soy! This book makes no claim to be allergy friendly and if you are looking for allergy sensitive recipes this is not the right resource for you.

The first section of the book is a hefty resource on eating gluten free and some excellent comparisons of GF staples like pasta. I discovered Jovial pasta from this book and could not be happier! The book also lists the preferred brands for the ingredients. As with all ATK books, each recipe has a preface explaining their research process and what worked and what didn't as they perfected the recipes. Oddly enough, I found these highly entertaining since I stumbled and flopped many a time in my first year of GF cooking and it was nice to read that I was not alone!

The recipes that were sincerely the best GF ones I have used were: Pancakes, waffles, cookies, and Pizza. The chocolate chip cookie recipe here reproduces the tender chewy consistency that is so hard with GF cooking where, more often than not, my cookies seem to turn into puddles of melted sugar!

My attempt at the socca (chickpea pancake) did not work out well and neither did the dinner rolls. I will be trying again with fresher yeast but I found that the yeast breads (including pizza) were fairly dense with this recipe. GF cooking is difficult and the slightest tweak can cause problems with baking so I will be giving the failed recipes another chance

An important detail for me is that the some of the recipes in the book are much more time consuming than the one in the Nadrone book (cooking for Isaiah). Yes, the extra effort produces a pizza crust that is more like a regular pizza but my son doesn't mind the more cracker like consistency of GF crusts and I doubt I will put in 50 minutes of baking time for two crusts when I can make a quicker version instead. This sacrifice of time for quality is also in the pancake recipe where you whip the egg whites and fold them in gently at the end to make them fluffier. I must say, though, that I my child thought these were the best pancakes he had eaten since going GF so this is a recipe I will repeat.

Cooking GF is a challenge since it is so very different from regular cooking and I wish I had a well laid out book like this one when I was starting out in GF cooking. While not all the recipes are perfect (which cookbook is?), many of them are real gems and will help make Celiac disease a little easier to live with for my child."
2,"This book goes into great detail as to why a person who is gluten intolerant must eat differently. Fortunately, no one in my family has this problem. I wanted to get the cookbook to try and cut out some of the gluten in our diets. I've read, and heard, that even if you don't suffer from celiac disease or gluten intolerance eating gluten free is a way of eating with health benefits. I have not been able to try any recipes yet. The list of ingredients you need in order to cook gluten free seems to be many and hard to find in some areas. Also, switching to gluten free is a bit pricey. I will be trying out a few of the recipes when I can afford it. But I do want to stress, this is a very in depth and informative book on cooking gluten free!"
2,"This is one of the best gf cookbooks I have! I use their basic flour mixture and use it for all of my baking. My favorites are: Pumpkin Pie (pie dough) recipe, stovetop mac n cheese (I make this when we go camping too) and sugar cookies recipe. I make these all the time and nobody in my family knows they are gf."
2,"This has been one of the BEST purchases in learning how to bake Gluten-Free. I so appreciate the descriptions and differences that the Test Kitchen gives using the various options for ""flours and gums."" Personally, I am not a test baker. I want to turn out a good product each time I am in the kitchen. Unfortunately that has kept me from trying to convert some of my favorite recipes. This book has given me some much needed guidance so that I feel more prepared to try to convert old family favorites into items I can once again enjoy."
2,"How do they make Gluten Free food taste so good? I bought this book for my sister who can't eat gluten. Now I'm cooking recipes from this cookbook and love it (I can eat gluten, but these recipes are good). The instructions are very clear and they even explain why certain steps are used when baking gluten free. I love the education that I gain while learning to cook without gluten. This is a great gift for anyone who is new to the gluten-free world."
2,"Made the tart crust for a friend - last minute - followed directions closely and threw together ingredients for pine nut and honey filling (not in book, inspired from elsewhere) - literally no time to test the success of crust or tart - ran out door with tart in tow - everyone was amazed that it was gluten free - devoured instantly with compliments and requests for recipes the next day ----

Have also made breads and other recipes from this book. Highly recommended. Best gluten free recipes I have found after years and years of searching."
2,"Leave it to America's Test Kitchen to Do Gluten as it needed to be done. If you have thought about trying a gluten-free life, this book will make it as easy as it can be. So... not ""you'll never miss it"" but you will have loads of delicious recipes to fall back on. (PS: Terry Gross on NPR's ""Fresh Air"" interviewed the authors on her program on March 20, 2014. Look for the podcast on her website.)

Others have commented on the ingredients. I was relieved to see that they don't use nut flours much. I was very happy that they tell you what would happen if you substituted either King Arthur GF Flour or Bob's Red Mill GF All Purpose, mainly because I have a shelf full of the latter to use up, and I am cautious about eating a lot of rice flour.

I've tried the english muffins (excellent, chewy) the recipe yielded about 1200g of dough, so I could have made a dozen easily. You don't need rings to shape them, meaning you can make big ones if you want to (burger buns!). I made the sandwich bread next. Same recipe as the english muffins. Well, the best bread I've made so far, very like Rudi's Flax and Fiber loaf. Somewhat dry and a bit cardboard-y so I sliced it thin but on the other hand it holds up to fillings well.

NOTE: The book warns to use an 8x4 pan rather than 9x5, but the dough (ingredients carefully measured by weight)filled the 8x4 pan to the top, so I put it into a 9x5 ""cloaked it"" with a dusting of sweet rice flour (how else am I going to get rid of it?) and let it rise above the top of the pan before baking. The loaf came out high and rounded and lovely.

The bread has an unidentifiable-to-me smell, which is a bother, but I'd keep using it and maybe make some changes (less sugar, more salt, for a start).

Oh, and you will probably need to have a really good mixer to make the bread, it is a large recipe and gets quite stiff by the time it is mixed.

I also made the blueberry muffins and thought it was one of the poorest recipes I've tried from any source. I threw the last one out, I just couldn't eat it. Very grainy rice texture. I only use Pamela's bread mix for muffins, and love it. Soft and almost wheaty.

I was excited by the unusual: the pupusas and arepas which are latin american specialties, tabbouleh, millet cereal, and good old biscuits, which I'm going to try next (hoping to turn them into scones) because I haven't had one in years.

A very useful book, with enough detail for anyone new to gf baking to follow."
2,"This book goes far beyond just good recipes. As is typical with America's Test Kitchen, they have spent a year evaluating different recipes and trying lots of options to create the best possible result. I especially enjoy reading about the science behind the recipes, but you don't have to do that if you don't want. Rest assured, each recipe will be fabulous if you follow the instructions. They do use a lot of eggs and dairy products, which I am also not able to eat, so I have to make some additional adjustments, but things are still MUCH better than recipes where people just exchange a gluten free flour. THANK YOU!"
2,"This cookbook is awesome! If you, like us, are avoiding gluten for any number of reasons - this is the cookbook you need. My kids have been all over this since we got it. Cupcakes and cake have been the hardest to adjust to missing at birthdays for my kids - now they don't have to miss it! My 12 yr old made the cupcakes immediately and the results were wonderful. Light and delicious. I don't recommend the cream cheese frosting they have in this book - there are better ones out there. I haven't tried the bread recipes yet, because I have one we love that is simple for me, but if they're anything like other America's Test Kitchen recipes - I won't be disappointed.
Thanks America's Test Kitchen!"
2,"I got this book primarily for the baked goods recipes and was not disappointed. Truly delicious gluten-free desserts that taste like the ""real"" thing. No weird after-taste, etc. Just plain delicious baked goods. The only downside is that the recipes require a pretty sizable investment in a variety of different flours, some available only at ""gourmet"" stores (ala Whole Foods or the like). I spent more than $20 just on the ingredients to make the ATK flour blend, plus purchasing xanthan gum. Besides that minor quibble (hey, the flour blend does work, so I can't really complain), the recipes have been great!"
2,"Thank you ATK! We have been waiting for a cookbook like this for a long time. Not only do they have a gluten free flour mix that works, the recipes work as well! We made chocolate chip cookies from scratch (AND at high altitude) and they tasted exactly like the ones we used to make with all-purpose (wheat) flour. The chocolate chip cookies actually stayed soft for 2 full days. I can't say exactly how long they would stay soft because they are already gone! We also made the gluten free waffles this morning. Soooo good! If you have been struggling to find recipes that taste like the wheat version you remember, this cookbook is for you. It will really make you ask, ""How can it be gluten free???"" My family thanks ATK for all of their hard work to bring us food we can enjoy again!

I also did the math on the America's Test Kitchen Gluten Free Flour blend that they share with you on page 13. It is roughly $2.07 a pound (according to current Amazon pricing for the individual GF flours). That is less than half the price of the premixed flours that you buy at the grocery store. Plus, it tastes better!

The down-to-earth explanations and directions are very helpful. We can't wait to try the next recipe!"
2,"Wish it had more recipes, but overall it's a winner. I like the fact that they provide reasons why certain ingredients are in the recipe ( eg. milk powder for browning, oat flour for additional protein, etc.) This is more than a cookbook.It's a study in the art and science of food prep. I learned a lot from reading the ""support"" information and I hope others will take the time to read through it as well . Helpful info for those of us wanting to revise our home recipes to make them GF.

I have made several recipes and all have turned out beautifully. Big fan of the sandwich bread---now if someone can just figure out a way to preserve its' freshness without having to freeze it. Yes, a new project for ATK."
2,"I can't say enough about this cookbook. I have always loved Cook's Illustrated and now that they have moved into gluten free, I am so impressed. I tried almost every cookie recipe as soon as I got the book and I have nothing but praise for all of them. I served the cookies to friends and they couldn't believe that they were gluten free. I have been gluten free for more than 10 years and of all the cookbooks I have collected over the years, this and Annaliese Roberts Gluten Free Classics are my favorites. This makes a great gift for a gluten free friend."
2,"FYI, BOB'S RED MILL, now has ""BOB'S RED MILL, Gluten Free 1 TO 1 Baking Flour"", I just made a ""test pie crust"", and it has perfect texture, and taste. This product is fairly expensive, but there is no soybean in it, therefore, no after taste this book, repeatedly, mentioned, so if you want a great result, use this flour. I am Lactose Intolerant, too, so I am not able to use all the recipes, but many I can adapt. This is a very good book."
2,"This is a wonderful book that provides explanations of flours, starches, pastas, etc. used for gluten free. It rates specific name brand products and provides a variety of recipes. One of the better books that I have found in understanding and how to cook/bake gluten free. I would readily recommend it."
2,"A good guide although, a lot of starches are used and have not gotten the flavors I had hoped for. I make up the basic mix and then use it in conjunction with my own gf mix. The textures probably aren't the same but the flavor is better. If you follow it TO THE LETTER it will come out as they predict. A bit of a science project but every GF home needs this book."
2,This is the best gluten free cookbook and consistent with the high quality of everything America's Test Kitchen does. The flour mixture works great. We made bread in both a breadmaker and by hand. Both breads were good but the handmade bread was fairly easy and amazing. You can't buy gluten free bread this good. Can't wait to try more recipes!
2,"I like the explanation as to why certain ingredients are used or why certain methods are employed, that allows me to adjust the recipes I have made for years to be gluten free. I like their recipes as well but I've been most happy learning how the ingredients work together. If you are just looking for a good book of recipes this will be great for you too."
2,"Wow! I bought this book last week, purchased the flours this morning, and just made the basic bread recipe. It was wonderful and brought fresh baked bread back into our lives. I haven't tried any other recipes yet but was so excited that I had to review the book right away ."
2,"So far, I've tried 4 recipes from this book. I highly recommend the Gluten Free Lemon Pound cake. You do have to follow the detailed instructions, but the authors give you the reasoning behind their methods. My fiancÃ© could not tell that the chocolate chip cookies were gluten-free (except that I should have added nuts to the recipe. Next time. :). I will continue to try different recipes as the need arises, and I'm expecting great results when I do."
2,I loved every page of this book.. Devoured it in one sitting. If you like to understand the how and why of successful gluten free baking you must have this book.. I love Cooks Illustrated magazine and this book is up to the standards of that publication. I have it on my Kindle and will soon order a paper copy. The comfort food recipes look really good and I will soon try them all. Have just ordered all the ingredients to make the ATK recommended flour mix.
2,"Another informative, practical and entertaining cookbook from America's Test Kitchen. What I love about these specialty volumes is that they are almost all in full-colour rather than the monochromatic form their magazines are published in.

This Gluten-Free guide:
Pros:
+ Introduction that explains what Gluten-Free is
+ Simple and easy to understand substitutions with everyday recipes such as lasagna and crumb cake
+ Use of store bought and commonly available Gluten-Free mixes and ingredients.
+ Reviews and side-by-side comparisons on the results in sample recipes of these same widely available Gluten-Free mixes.
+ Recommends which one of the widely available mixes to use with which recipe for the best results
+ America's Test Kitchen also developed and tested their own Gluten-Free ""flour"" blend which is also really good.
+ This book does not favour its own blend over others. It compares them on equal footing and does not hesitate to recommend other mixes over its own if that's what gives the best results for a specific recipe.

Cons:
- The majority of the recipes do use Gluten-Free ingredients that are ok for those merely looking to practice a Gluten-reduced diet but is not compatible for those that are diagnosed Celiac. Examples are recipes that feature Gluten-Free oats whcih are suitable for those that are merely sensitive but would cause severe distress for those diagnosed Celiac due to cross-sensitivity. Another example would be chocolate and cocoa powder which may be certified Gluten-Free but can still irritate a Celiac.
- There are a large number of recipes devoted to baked goods and the use of gluten-Free pastas.

Overall a very practical, easy to follow and understand book by America's test kitchen. Perfect for those wanting to practice a Gluten-reduced diet for health reasons but is not suitable for someone who has actually been diagnosed Celiac."
2,"I have made all the breads in the book and they are great. The best is the cinnamon raisin bread. I have also made the chocolate chip cookies, lemon pound cake, pie crust (which, as it is with all GF pie crusts, difficult to handle), and some more items. I l love this book so much that I am getting rid of my other cookbooks that ask for a flour mix to be made. One thing though, if you are lactose intolerant, do not buy the book as the flour blend asks for powdered milk. Some of the recipes call for additional powdered milk as well. Just so you know."
2,"Not as much a collection of recipes that happen to not have gluten, But a lot of recipes that replace gluten foods: breads, pie crusts, etc.

I showed to 2 people I know with gluten allergies, and they are both planning on getting copies."
2,"My 17 year old daughter was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease after struggling with symptoms that doctors couldn't explain. She loves to bake and had wanted to become a pastry chef. Fortunately, I found this cookbook. I already owned countless America's Test Kitchen products, including Cooks Illustrated and Cooks Country. Every recipe in this book has turned out well for me. We gobbled a batch of the chewy sugar cookies yesterday. I'm so very thankful to this company and hope they produce many, many more cookbooks for people that must be gluten-free."
2,"When I ordered this book I was quite excited. A gluten free cookbook that seemed to have some real thought behind it and new ideas. The one recipe I was particularly looking forward too was for the sandwich bread. I have been a diagnosed coeliac for 17 years and a good bread for some one who is required to be gluten free is hard to find. Granted, with the increased awareness and popularity of the gluten free diet the options are getting better. Imagine my disappointment when I reached this recipe in the book, and one of the ingredients is oat flour! Yes you can purchase wheat free oat flour, but a warning to many coeliacs out there, especially newly diagnosed, many coeliacs react to oats as well due to the similarity of the protein structures in oats and wheat. I am excited by trying many of the recipes in the book as they are different to many recipes that just substitute gluten free flour for regular flour.

Great cook book for those are choosing to be gluten free, rather than those required to be gluten free due to the addition of oats in several of the recipes."
2,"The recipes were largely for pasta and other recipes that are fairly easy modify. That said, the few recipes I have tried were enjoyable. I particularly enjoyed pasta carbonara. There are better gluten free cookbooks available, but this is not the best."
2,"A beautiful book aesthetically and while I haven't tried the recipes, I appreciate the first chapter filled with so much information about GF eating in general. I am gluten-sensitive, and it has gotten more pronounced as time goes on, so I knew I had to officially get away from all food items that were not working for me. I was shown this book by a relative and bought it on title alone. I have been disappointed with may of the substitute flours and the huge expense of purchasing ready-made GF items, so this looked like a win-win. SO excited to try some of the recipes this
Spring!"
2,I made the cornbread stuffing for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful. Next year I might freeze the cornbread sheets after baking to make the preparation easier. I have also made the pad Thai and it was great.
2,"Amazing cookbook!!! I got this as a gift a month after being diagnosed gluten intolerant and was hesitant at first. All the googled recipes I had tried and store bought substitutes had left me feeling hungry none them tasted right and it didn't help that I suck at cooking. Well now I am nice and full the recipes are great and easy, even my foodie fiance is impressed, and I don't feel limited on food anymore it is great. Can't wait to get volume 2 yay"
2,Best book on the subject we have found. Additionally They test different products and give you their take. The developed their own baking blend- we have been using it and it has been great! Had awesome apple pie crust for Thanksgiving
2,I don't understand why people are giving this book bad reviews for nutrition. It's a cook book for gluten free baking not a health or nutrition book. Some of us rarely indulge in processed sugary treats but when we do then flavor is the most important factor. If you fall into this group you will love this book. I can make any recipe in this book and I know it will turn out well enough for me to serve my guests or take to a potluck etc. If you are looking for a nutrition/healthy cookbook look elsewhere. I'm glad ATK made this cookbook as its given me back my joy for baking.
2,"Haven't tried the recipes yet but trust the cooks at the Test Kitchen. They sound delicious. Great pictures too. Have to start collecting the ingredients. Only afraid it will be fattening because I'll want to eat all of it. Thank you ""Cooks""! Now all I need is a GF recipe for Norwegian Yulekage and I can get through this GF challenge. As a person with celiac disease, I can't thank you enough. Applause Applause Applause. Joan"
2,Lots of great gluten free recipes. Well worth it. Thanks for sharing! I also enjoyed some Italian gluten free recipes for the gluten free beginner You'd Never Know it's Gluten Free: 27 Simple and Delicious Recipes from the Italian Mama's Kitchen
2,"Over the past several years, I have struggled with gluten issues and a fair amount of denial. As such, I'd had problems eating healthy and especially enjoying foods. While I have only had this a few days, it has really peaked my interested and shown me at least a little bit of light. I found this book does a good job of adapting familiar foods to your needs. While much of it seems like the same old foods, they are foods I can get away with eating now! The book also seems well written and laid out, with many photos and descriptive recipes."
2,There is something for everyone here. A generous range of recipes from vegetarian to those for meat-eaters. A welcome addition to the gluten-free cookbook library.
2,"Pizza recipe works great. The information is informative. The goal of the book is only to have recipes the previously require wheat flour. If you want meat and vegetable recipes, this is not the right book for you."
2,"This is THE BEST gluten free cookbook I have found. The recipes are actually good and easy to follow. The full-color photographs are excellent. This book is very well organized in sections such as desserts, breads, etc. If you need a gluten free cookbook, go straight for this one FIRST. It is the best!"
2,Just want to add my 2 cents. The Almond Cake is divine! Even I can't believe it is gluten free. And no dairy. Not everything I have made from this book has been great but this is a real winner.
2,I have not made any of the recipes out of the book however this book has taught me a lot about gluten and the right way to substitute ingredients to make them taste good. There are so many gross gluten free products out there and I had no idea where to start to make some of my own products. Good educational value and I am sure that once I test the recipes that they will be good as I do like the America's test Kitchen recipes for the most part.
2,"This is my first cookbook since discovering my gluten sensitivity. I'm not much of a cook, so I was a little frightened, but was pleasantly surprised! The directions are very clear with lots of pictures (I NEED pictures) so you know what you are doing is correct. Love it! Ps. Try the baked mac and cheese it's amazing!"
2,The Sandwich bread recipe is the best GF one we've tried so far. Can't wait to try the Multigrain one!
2,"Great cookbook. I have made a number of things from this cookbook, some multiple times. This cookbook not only has frequently desired dishes that people on a gluten free diet long to have but it also explains why each recipe works - very helpful. I have recommended it many times."
2,Excellent cookbook even if it wasn't gluten free; lots of pictures; very good explanations and detailsâ€¦it doesn't assume you know everything about cooking/baking and I appreciate that. Uses own gluten free flour mix (no almond flour) but has all the recipes for your fav foods. The english muffins were excellent; lots of work but well worth it! Buy it if you want some of your old time fav recipes that are gluten free. The wheat belly guy would not approve but sometimes you just have to eat what you like.
2,"Foodie meets Gluten Free. I have been a big fan of America's Test Kitchen for several years (pre-Gluten Free) and everything comes out with the exact taste and texture described if you follow their instructions exactly. The recipes are thoroughly tested so no more experiments which is the name of the game in gluten free baking/cooking. Nothing ever works the way it should or tastes quite right. This book is the answer to being to make your pre-GF diet favorites with nearly the same texture. I have already made the Blueberry Muffins, English Muffins, and drunken noodles (a little spicy if serving kids) and they are EXCELLENT! Thank you ATK so much for doing the copious amounts of work that must have went into creating this book. It is very much appreciated"
2,"great, thorough book! Very detailed about how the recipes were developed. Meant to give it 4 stars, not one!"
2,I really liked how simple the book and recipes were to follow. I would recommend it for anyone truly interested in kickstarting a gluten free diet.
2,"Judging from the reviews, it seems there are roughly three types of people buying this book.

1. People who are eating gluten-free for the health benefits.

Seriously? Hie thee to a nutritionist. The myth that gf versions of wheat-based products are some how ""healthier"" has been debunked time and time again by reputable doctors and professionals, especially when compared to whole grain versions of those same products. Which is not to say there isn't some benefit to cutting wheat from one's diet entirely -- by simply NOT EATING cake or pasta. But if you're really buying a recipe book which mainly contains things like chocolate cake and apple pie, only to be disappointed in the lack of nutritional value... I don't think you get how food works.

2. People with multiple allergies or special diet requirements, which include but are not limited to avoiding gluten.

I feel for you. (As long as this is a real deal and not one of those fad diets because you read an article claiming eggs were the spawn of the devil. Then I have no pity.) I do! Living in a body that mistakes any trace of wheat for poison is bad enough; I can't imagine having even FEWER options. But again: I'm unsure as to why you thought this book in particular would be helpful. This is mainly basic, comfort-eating American foodstuffs -- you'd be much better off adapting to the diet of countries or cultures which naturally gravitate away from the things that hurt you. (Before anyone gets smart: yes, this is exactly what I did myself following my diagnosis, because sub-par gf options were just a painful reminder of previous deliciousness.) Which is not to say there aren't specialty blogs or books with recipes for whatever you crave, or that the people at America's Test Kitchen didn't do their best to talk about substitutions. But sure, a cookbook that only claims to be free of gluten might not be the answer to your multiple dietary needs.

3. Celiacs or the gluten-intolerant, who sometimes just want a slice of bread that doesn't feel like punishment.

We've all been there. Cooked pasta that crunches like cereal, or dissolves into unspeakable gloop. Biscuits that could easily absorb the oil from tanker spills. Bread that would pass Monty Python's patented 'Is It A Witch?' test with flying colors.

It's not that we can't live without these things, and many of us do. But it can sometimes bewilder that, despite living in an age where we shoot people into space and pour our entire lives into our phones, there are precious few gluten-free substitutes that AREN'T actively terrible. I'm not even asking for great or indistinguishable from the ""real"" stuff -- it really, truly takes effort to find gluten-free versions that share any similarity of taste or texture with the food we once loved. What's the deal? Is wheat MAGIC?

... not quite, but, as the lovely, dedicated, and smart people at America's Test Kitchen explain in this book, wheat does command its own particular science. (Which might even be worse.) They take you through it in various foodstuff forms: what happens to pasta in boiling water without the protection of wheat protein, how non-wheat starches have a hard time absorbing the butter in baked goods, and why I couldn't find a decent yellow cake recipe for love or money. They tick off the usual problems with gluten-free food, even the stuff you make at home: too dry? too greasy? too dense? falls apart at the first touch? is the outside burnt to a crisp while the center remains gooey and uncooked? (I would never, ever have believed that last was possible... until the Great Cupcake Abomination of '12, in which dozens of baked goods lost their lives, and ultimately for naught.) They can tell you why and -- miracle of miracles! -- suggest how to modify your current recipes to fix it.

For me, this is why the book's a treasure. It's not just the recipes, although I've had great results so far and I'm sure will continue to do so as I work through the rest. You could even argue this book has value DESPITE the recipes, as (another thing you can easily glean from reviews) many gf peeps already have firm loyalties to a particular blog, brand, or procedure, and find ATK's to be too basic, even limited. I think it's worth noting that ATK took the most general and accessible approach possible: limiting their experiments with store-bought flour blends to two most well-known brands, and sticking to recipes that require a standard, if slightly adjusted, flour blend in the first place. (My favorite gf brownies use nothing but almond pulp.) It's very likely that, if you enjoy cooking and you've been gluten-free for a considerable length of time, you've already collected a few recipes you find preferable to the alternatives offered in ""How Can It Be Gluten Free.""

No, the real value of this book is its sheer thoroughness. Step by step -- misstep by misstep -- ATK walks you through their process, including a Why This Recipe Works section for each recipe and several multi-page spreads on general topics. It's an absolute treasure trove of information for those of us who DON'T have state-of-the-art kitchens and a bevvy of professionals at our disposal. It's impossible to catalogue every tidbit I took away, even on my first read-through. A good example might be the difference between their yellow cake and birthday cupcakes: no difference, except don't whip the egg whites in the latter, because it creates a dome effect which makes icing a pain. If this kind of attention to detail is not your thing -- if you're just looking for a book that tells you what to do, so you can do it and be done -- by all means, pass this one by.

However, some of us want more than good recipes. Some of us want to know WHY recipes work or fail, or why it came out beautifully that time we forgot the mixed batter on the counter because Game of Thrones was on, and it's never tasted as good since. It's the old giving a fish versus teaching how to fish -- ""How Can It Be Gluten Free"" puts the knowledge, and therefore power, into the hands of its reader. It's more than the recipes it offers. It's going to be my personal Rosetta Stone for any gluten-free recipes I encounter from now on, or when experimenting in making my own. I'm even planning on using its insights to adjust a few store-bought mixes, for when I've only got enough energy to turn on the oven.

So if you're in the first or second group, this book probably won't knock your socks off. But if you're my brethren of the third, and you enjoy cooking: this is an exhaustively-documented, beautifully-photographed, and near-encyclopedic tome on the ins, outs, arounds, and abouts of cooking and baking without that magical gluten ingredient.

Who needs it? We've got science on our side."
2,"We are newbies to GF cooking and I am so glad that ATK has take this on. Prior to going GF we were huge ATK fans already so we knew we could rely on them for tried and true recipes. I have tried a couple recipes and have not been disappointed. Honestly, even just the intro was hugely helpful- discusses various GF cooking ingredients, rates them and offers advice on storage. Well worth the money for me."
2,"I love this book!!! lots of photos, and tons of research done on everything from products to why a recipe works. Lots of great tips too! this is by Americas Test Kitchen and Cooks magazine folks which I think are excellent!!!"
2,"Very, very good. Gives many good ideas for gluten free bakery. You will not be disappointed to have this book ."
2,Got to go Gluten free so the more I find out the better it will be.
2,"If you or someone in your family suffer from any form of Celiac Disease (intolerance of the gluten found within wheat, rye, kamut and barley) this publication will serve your needs very well by offering excellent advice for cooking, recipes and dietary alternatives."
2,"Though gluten intolerance has been getting more than its ten minutes of fame in the media over the last couple of years, it is important to get the facts straight first. Severe gluten intolerance is known as â€œCeliac Disease (CD)â€ and can be very debilitating in its most severe form. However, CD is still very rare! In fact, though the numbers of legitimate cases being reported to the CDC have increased over the last 20 years, it has strictly been a numerical gain based on increasing populations, not an increase in percentage. Both the FDA & AMA have presented current studies which indicate severe CD is being over diagnosed by many practitioners. Unfortunately, far too many are also pre-maturely jumping to conclusions, climbing aboard bandwagons and unjustifiably linking this condition to faddish diet and personal health plans. As always, unscrupulous individuals and businesses will hype the legitimate need/demand in an effort to expand the market and increase their profits. Beware!

Now, regarding this book â€¦ if you or someone in your family does, in fact, have severe CD (intolerance of the gluten found within wheat, rye, kamut and barley) this publication will serve your needs very well by offering excellent advice for cooking, recipes and dietary alternatives."
1,"I like the recipes that I have tried. Some are a bit fussy--the banana bread recipe tells you to cook the bananas in a pan on the stove before stirring them into the batter! But Cook's Illustrated is that way... I was disappointed in the quality of the book. The cover detached from the body of the book in a matter of months.

The cornbread stuffing is one of my family's favorite recipes from this book."
1,"I had high hopes for this based on past experiences with ATF cookbooks, but so far it has been hit or miss. I made bisucits last night, following directions exactly. They weren't light and fluffy but they were not bad. The cornbread is barely ok - it doesn't raise very well and it is super corny (haha). The ingredients for their own ATF gluten-free flour are not cheap - but then again none of the commercial blends are cheap either."
1,"This book offers detailed instructions on gluten-free cooking. The test group has tested each recipe extensively, so the results can be extraordinary. I have two caveats, however: 1) Some of the recipes are very detailed and take a long time to prepare. Your investment in excellent results and your time commitment will determine how helpful the book is, and 2) I would find the book more helpful if it were published with a ring binding so that it would lie flat."
1,"I usually love cook books from America's Test Kitchen and Cooks Illustrated. I appreciate the instructions on technique, the step-by-step photos, the tips on best brands. But I'm disappointed in this book because it omits a huge range of gluten free flours and while the recipes come up with techniques for handling many challenges of gf baking, the several I've tested add plenty of materials, prep and hassle time for only marginally better results than I was already able to achieve without.

The biggest disappointment was the complete lack of recipes for other essential gf flours like, almond, sorghum, millet, and garbanzo/fava. The books editors focus mainly on their own rice, tapioca blend, and use two store bought blend variations, King Arthur and Bob's Red Mill All purpose (which I also use.) From my own experience sorghum mixes with rice or almond flour can produce a blend that has more depth of whole grain flavor and is closer to wheat in texture.

For people who bake all their own gf products, the effort is time consuming enough. Yet the recipe for basic sandwich bread, for example, has long rise times and added steps like building a foil collar around the pan so the bread raises higher. Ideally, one has bread pans with no handle lips so the foil collars can be properly attached. Mine don't but the dough really didn't seem to rise that much more anyway. The pizza instructions require an act of faith. The dough requires enough water to make a thickish batter which one spreads out with a spatula (sticky situation) then par bakes for an hour to drive the water out. This all before you even add the toppings and do the final baking, thus defeating the purpose of a quick pizza meal unless you spend an afternoon par baking crusts in advance and freezing them.

For people who are new to gf baking this is a good starter book. But try a few other gf cookbooks to experience a world of wonderful gf flours."
1,"Contains many recipes. It is thoroughly researched and well presented, unfortunately, for my preference, it is mostly about desserts and breads and has precious little about main course entries. It's a good one especially for baking and dessert making but not what I had hoped for in terms of entries."
1,"Good information about cooking skills for GF, why things work/don't work, and choice of flours, blends, pastas but very heavy use of sugar and dairy in recipes. Excellent bread recipes if you like using white rice flour or any rice flour. I've adapted several of the bread/muffin/pancake recipes to use a blend of almond, potato, and pea flour instead of rice flour with good results."
1,There were great reviews for this book when I bought it but I was disappointed at how much work is involved making the recipes. I didn't realize I needed several types of flour to make each recipe. Being gluten free is tough enough: I need simpler solutions.
1,"IMO they didn't experiment enough with different grain blends like Miller and sorghum, which add a nice texture. I learned a lot and like it but never reach for it because I'm not a fan of the flour blends they suggest."
1,Good book for gluten free baking just to man ingredients for each recipe as for as I am concerned.
1,Didn't add much to the party for me
1,"Like most gluten free recipe books, this one has many recipes for sweets than anything else. I wanted one for good bread,everyday sandwich bread as well as sourdough bread, and yes there are good recipes for bread if you like cake bread."
1,Not my favorite cook book
1,"great recipes, mostly bread type foods"
1,The recipes all look great and I've bought the ingredients but the preparation seems daunting - perhaps too detailed to the point where I'm afraid if I make one wrong step it will be a disaster.
1,"I am very disappointed by this cookbook. I am not new to gluten-free baking, but was hoping to find some more advanced recipes to add to my family's diet. Unfortunately, I've had great difficulty replicating these recipes, even when following them exactly. They seem unnecessarily complicated and don't turn out well. Many of the things I have made are grainy and tasteless. The recipes I have found online or experimented with myself are much better."
1,"There are no nutrient values given for any of the recipes. Considering this is ATK, I had definitely expected that.

Also, disappointed to find that there are NO recipes using coconut flour or almond meal in place of regular flour even in part.
I am going to be giving this away... To me it's just another cookbook."
1,I was expecting a lot more from this book . a lot of the information was redundant because if you are gluten intolerant you 've already worked most of this out .For someone who 's just starting out on gluten free it is probably just what they need I liked the bread recipes though . They do work better than most others .
1,Little hard to navigate.
1,"Overall I've had better luck with other GF cookbooks. There are other GF cookbooks that are more sophisticated. I was disappointed with the cake recipe here because it uses white chocolate as a key ingredient. This is not good from a nutrition standpoint but also for people who can't or don't want to eat chocolate with every cake. I'm looking for more nutritious recipes that do not rely on sugar or chocolate to mask their underlying weakness. Plus I didn't like their bread recipe that uses a weird ingredient that can only be found online. But having said that, I did like the cookie recipes - especially the oatmeal one. I also liked the intro section to GF cooking but some of their food recommendations are off -- for example, I tried their pick for the top spaghetti brand and found it is just so-so, IMHO."
1,"With 8 celiac's in the family I'm very familiar with the diet and with the complexity of gluten free baking. This book gets an A+ for only having one flour mix instead of the more common 4 or 5 mixes in other books I have. On the other hand I give them a C for not making the mix dairy free. While I don't have celiac, I am lactose intolerant and my MIL and son are both celiac and lactose intolerant. I've made the pizza dough and it's only ok. As good as the best I've made, better than the ready made that my dh gets at the local pizzeria. They recommend a pasta that is not easily available and when I looked for it here on Amazon it was a great deal more expensive than what they quote.
The recipes that I haven't tried look ok, except that too many of them have dairy. My big complaint is how they measure ingredients. They sell weighing the flour ingredients with a digital scale, which I totally agree with. I've been weighing baking ingredients for years, using the metric button on my digital scale., but they don't use metric and for everything else they use volume. Really? It's confusing and inaccurate. I made the almond cake, which was quite good, but the weight of the packages was not the same as measuring it out. I made the brownies too, which were very good."
1,"Most of the ingredients you have to get are way too expensive, so this book was not good for my uses."
1,"Very good recipes, all tried, true, and tested! One of the better gluton free recipe books. Many choices for many different dishes."
1,To excpensive to make and not like store boght
1,Should have listened to another post. I am also dairy intolerant and these recipes use mega dairy. Sour Cream for a pie crust? Really? I do better with my other resources. I was hopeful as cooks illustrated does have a great reputation.
1,Didn't care forthis boook very much. Too much sugar!
1,"There are so many ingredients I cannot eat, egga, dairy, sugar, etc so it really is not helpful for me to cook from...Too many unhealthful things for me."
1,"I made the chocolate cake and it was a complete flop. It didnâ€™t rise (no surprise, I could tell before I put it in the oven that there wasnâ€™t enough xanthum gum and there was way too much moisture). I got much better results from using the regular test kitchen cake recipe and just using a gluten free flour instead of a gluten one. This cake was such a disaster that Iâ€™m not going to throw good money after bad and attempt anything else from this book when there are so many good recipes out there. These books are going straight to half price books (but if you see them there donâ€™t buy them)."
1,"If you want to avoid gluten and you love white bread, you'll love this cookbook. I have non-celiac gluten sensitivity, but, even before I identified this condition, I didn't eat white bread. My husband and I love reading Cook's magazine. (We think of it as ""food porn"" because of the emphasis on sensory gratification in the writing of the articles.) Even so, it never occurred to me that their starting point for recipes would be an attempt to mimic the blandness of white-flour recipes. For decades GF diets relied on rice flour, but now there are so many alternatives that not only have flavor but some nutrition as well. ATK dismissed sorghum flour for ""its earthy flavor that made these blends taste more like whole-wheat flour.""

Okay, given this bias, did they at least come up with a decent multigrain bread for those of us who prefer this style? No, not really. The best they could do is a ""multigrain sandwich bread"" using their white-flour blend but adding a small amount of a hot-cereal product. It's as if they chose to ignore most of the GF product advances of the past 5-10 years. Faced with a need to add protein to their flour blend (to provide structure, not nutrition), they added milk powder or powdered egg whites. This eliminates a whole subgroup of folks who have issues with dairy as well as gluten. Why not try other flours, such as almond, coconut, millet, amaranth, etc.?

I think that some of the scientific discussions might prove useful, but when I want to make satisfying breads, I'm not going to start with white rice flour as the default. I am sorely disappointed in the narrow focus of the ATK's experiments with gluten-free cooking. Generally I prefer Carol Fenster's recent cookbooks using a sorghum flour blend, but I also look for recipes online and in other cookbooks that combine high-protein and high-fiber flours."
1,Ok book but nothing exciting here.
1,"Ok, it is a cookbook and does deal with gluten free cooking. However, this is a little too technical. I don't care why a recipe works and i don't want to make a gluten free flour from scratch. I much prefer a cookbook that just says, use gluten free flour ( any brand) or use corn starch . etc. i don't need to know all the in and outs all i want is some ideas for gluten free meals and baking.a"
1,"I am not too fond of ATK Gluten Free Cook Book because he uses white rice flour & potato starch plus oat flour etc. I follow Dr. William Davis in Lose the Wheat, Lose the Wheat Cook Book.which has improved my cholesterol levels & helped me lose weight.. This is my personal opinion. ATK Cook Book does list his favorites in pastas, etc He does not like any pastas made from corn. My favorite pastas are made from corn & imported from Italy. However When I was not Gluten Free, Paleo, low cabbohydrate etc. I liked his regular cookbook."
1,"Haven't had much of a chance to try recipes yet, but after browsing through, looks like it will be fine."
1,Very disappointed in product
1,"I have made a few of the recipes and have come to the conclusion that trying to use one blend for every recipe was a mistake. I know it makes it easier but it just doesn't work. I think I would have liked a flour more customized to the recipe rather than spend time on fussy steps that most people don't have time for, like simmering the canned pumpkin with the spices and melting the cream cheese into it for pumpkin bread. I jumped through those and other hoops that didn't seem worth the end results for the time they took. I would rather have mixed up 2 or 3 different flour blends to get good results. One glaring example of the blend not working would be the buttermilk biscuits. The heavy-on-the-white-rice flour blend made for a very odd-tasting biscuit. They were very determined to create the one perfect all-purpose gluten-free blend, but I don't think it exists. One thing I would say they got right was having you weigh your flour rather than measure it in a cup. That is the best way to measure flour and will give you the best results."
1,"A tragic waste of trees. When I heard the authors of this thing describe, in a radio interview, how they had developed their recipes I immediately bought a copy thinking that, at last, I could start making really good GF foods. Then I tried a sampling of their recipes, all of which ended up in my compost pile. The authors go into great detail about the differences between wheat flour and gluten free (GF) flours and how GF flours don't absorb fats and liquids the way wheat flour does. You'd think that this wisdom would be reflected in their recipes. Take a look at the recipe for shortbread cookies. The fat to GF flour ratio is higher than the traditional wheat flour-based recipe. A greasy mess! Their taste testers are also suspect in my opinion. Their highest-rated GF pastas are low on my list (yeah, I'm Italian and got to know good pasta before discovering my gluten sensitivity). While none of the GF pastas can stand up to wheat based pasta, there are GF pastas that are better and less expensive than those recommended by ATK.

My recommendation is don't waste your money on this thing. There are GF recipes available on the internet. Not only are they better recipes...they're free!"
1,"Save your money! This book was given to me as a gift and I'm glad I didn't shell out one cent for it. I have tried three recipes - the sandwich bread, rolls and piecrust. The sandwich bread tasted better than Udi's, by a bit. But the amount of time, effort, and cost didn't make it worth it. I will just have to accept that there are no good substitutes for wheat bread and live without. The photos of all products make them look like they would taste good, but that is wrong, wrong, wrong to assume. The rolls didn't taste good and crumbled - I questioned why there was no xanthum gum in the recipe but followed it to the letter. It took them two hours to even expand a little, and they never got to ""double"" in the rising process. Definitely not worth the effort. Then, just a few days ago, I made the pie crust for pumpkin pie to take to an early Thanksgiving potluck. The crust was so hard it couldn't be cut. ( For forty years I have made excellent, flaky pie crust with wheat flour so it wasn't a new experience for me) I ended up making another pie (thankfully, I had pumpkin on hand) two hours before leaving for the potluck, using almond meal as the main ingredient as that pie crust has always turned out to be highly edible. I won't be trying any more recipes. There are other books out there with good recipes and flour mixes. And for there to be so many recipes for foods that never contain gluten appears to be a ploy to add to the book so the price can be justified. I gave two stars instead of one because the bread tasted ok. Just wasn't worth the effort."
1,"Very complicated instructions, long ingredient lists with outcomes that are just okay. Many, many pages on extensive ""Why it works"" and steps they took that didn't work, what they tried that was okay, and what worked best. Too detailed - you'd think they reinvented boiling water. Then after all that, too many other things that can affect outcome aren't addressed. Humidity, altitude, and calling for ingredients that can be all over the place. For example the Florentine cookies call for 1/4 cup of ""orange marmalade"" which is fine, but do you know how many orange marmalades are on the market and how they differ in ingredients/consistency? I don't particularly care to make homemade foods with unnatural ingredients like potato flakes or milk powder. Which brings me to another disappointment, I also have intolerance to corn and most people with gluten intolerance also have dairy, egg or corn issues. Adding options to omit or replace those common inflammatory ingredients would have been nice.
The step by step photos are fine but because of the detail, a recipe can go for pages. A typical cookie recipe is 3 pages long! In the ""why it works"" part of a pasta recipe it explains ""Combine the dry ingredients on low speed, then add the eggs and oil and mix on medium-low until the dough comes together in a rough ball, about 10 seconds"". then again on the same page in the recipe: ""Pulse brown rice flour, tapioca starch, xanthan gum, and salt in food processor until combined. Add eggs and oil and process until dough forms and clears sides of bowl, about 10 seconds"". I'm overwhelmed with redundancy. Recipes don't even start until page 30 of the book because of all the analysis of appeal and evaluation and such of gluten free flour blends!

Lots of treats in here to get the newly GF person through junk food withdrawals but I don't think a person cooking GF for more than a year or two will learn anything new from this entry level book. An experienced GF cook likely has healthier, better tasting recipes than those found here. None of the blends include other tastier options for flour like amaranth or millet, or something with more depth than a rice flour base which is chalky tasting.
There are better Gluten Free cookbooks out there."
1,Arrived today. I am very disappointed. The print is very light and not easy to read. The recipes also do not list any nutritional information. For the Celiac diabetics it is essential. I will return it.
1,"No game changer here; bait and switch?

I made the mistake of buying the Kindle version, only to find recipe after recipe that yes, are gluten free, but at the enormous cost of my health. These recipes appear to be on par with junk food, nutritionally. What a shame, they could have used *real, whole nutritious, and actually healthy food* and hit one out of the park. Instead, people will end up trading one sickness for many others. So sad.

No nutritional info? No wonder. The publishers aren't going to highlight how nutritionally devoid these recipes are; that would be like waving a giant red flag: Here, come have your serving of high blood sugar, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, neurological disorders, and a whole host of other issues that begin in the gut. What happened to that old fashioned but effective adage, ""Junk in, junk out."" Applies here."
1,"I really LOVE ATK books and the science they apply to cooking. Many of my best GF recipes are adapted from the Test Kitchen books I own. So, while I would give this book 5 Stars there are reasons to give it 1 star. I've been testing and tasting my way through the book. It is starting to be spattered and worn -- a good sign.

The 5 Star recipe is the Cinnamon-Raisin Bread. It, like many of the recipes, has a very different preparation. Not difficult, but once mastered this is hands down the best Cinnamon-Raisin Bread GF, or not. It has a hard and crispy crust and a real chew, not cardboard. I soak the Golden Raisins overnight in Orange Juice or Grand Marnier. They just melt into wonderful when baked in the bread.

The pizza crust is supurb. However, it does take a long time to make with the rising time. The muffins are great. The rolls and biscuits are finally perfected. I like the book.

But, I'm also disappointed in the content. There seem to be many recipes that are gluten free already. How many non-gluten salads need to be in this book? Since I have many ATK books I spotted a few recycled non-GF recipes --- bad form. The book feels light-weight when it could have become a bible for GF cooking. I would like to see ATK incorporate GF changes into their TV show, and their regular books. Now that woud be perfect."
1,I want to cancel the Kindle order on How Can it Be gluten Free cookbook. I ordered the book instead.
