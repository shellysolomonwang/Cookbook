Every day, over 200 million Americans consume food products made of wheat. As a result, over 100 million of them experience some form of adverse health effect, ranging from minor rashes and high blood sugar to the unattractive stomach bulges that preventive cardiologist William Davis calls ""wheat bellies."" According to Davis, that excess fat has nothing to do with gluttony, sloth, or too much butter: It's due to the whole grain wraps we eat for lunch.

After witnessing over 2,000 patients regain their health after giving up wheat, Davis reached the disturbing conclusion that wheat is the single largest contributor to the nationwide obesity epidemic—and its elimination is key to dramatic weight loss and optimal health. In Wheat Belly, Davis exposes the harmful effects of what is actually a product of genetic tinkering and agribusiness being sold to the American public as ""wheat""—and provides readers with a user-friendly, step-by-step plan to navigate a new, wheat-free lifestyle.

Informed by cutting-edge science and nutrition, along with case studies from men and women who have experienced life-changing transformations in their health after waving goodbye to wheat, Wheat Belly is an illuminating look at what is truly making Americans sick and an action plan to clear our plates of this seemingly benign ingredient.",3272,"Review
“Fascinating, compelling, and more than a little entertaining, Wheat Belly may be the most important health book of the year.” —Dana Carpender, author of 500 Low-Carb Recipes

“Dr Davis' comprehensive, readable and witty book reveals that wheat, far from being the staff of life, is in fact the stuff of nightmares. Take his advice to lose wheat from your diet and you'll likely be paid back many times over in the form of a slimmer, healthier body and a better functioning brain.” —Dr. John Briffa BSc MB BS nutritional physician and author of Waist Disposal

Thug Kitchen started their wildly popular website to inspire people to eat some goddamn vegetables and adopt a healthier lifestyle. Beloved by Gwyneth Paltrow ('This might be my favorite thing ever') and with half a million Facebook fans and counting, Thug Kitchen wants to show everyone how to take charge of their plates and cook up some real f*cking food.

Yeah, plenty of blogs and cookbooks preach about how to eat more kale, why ginger fights inflammation, and how to cook with microgreens and nettles. But they are dull or pretentious as hell—and most people can't afford the hype.

Thug Kitchen lives in the real world. In their first cookbook, they're throwing down more than 100 recipes for their best-loved meals, snacks and sides for beginning cooks to home chefs. (Roasted Beer and Lime Cauliflower Tacos? Pumpkin Chili? Grilled Peach Salsa? Believe that sh*t.) Plus they're going to arm you with all the info and techniques you need to shop on a budget and go and kick a bunch of ass on your own.

This book is an invitation to everyone who wants to do better to elevate their kitchen game. No more ketchup and pizza counting as vegetables. No more drive-thru lines. No more avoiding the produce corner of the supermarket. Sh*t is about to get real.

“Dear reader, I love Thug Kitchen's cooking. As hilariously foul-mouthed as these motherf*ckers are, I really like their passion for eating the right food, for cutting to the chase, and for knocking up good, nutritious food from scratch. Their message is simple--stop relying on the microwave, stop relying on processed crap. Whoever you are and wherever you are, get down to the markets and supermarkets, use your budget to pick up some fresh ingredients, and get cooking. So, Thug Kitchen, good luck, and keep doing what you're doing.” —Jamie Oliver

Stroganoff originated in Russia as a beef dish served in a rich sour cream sauce. And though there are many versions of the original recipe, I prefer this plant-based one, made with rich porcini mushrooms and lots of fresh herbs.

2 large shallots, peeled and minced
4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
2 teaspoons minced thyme
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon minced rosemary
1 pound portobello mushrooms, stemmed and cut into large pieces

Most of us have heard of gluten—a protein found in wheat that causes widespread inflammation in the body. Americans spend billions of dollars on gluten-free diets in an effort to protect their health. But what if we’ve been missing the root of the problem? In The Plant Paradox, renowned cardiologist Dr. Steven Gundry reveals that gluten is just one variety of a common, and highly toxic, plant-based protein called lectin. Lectins are found not only in grains like wheat but also in the “gluten-free” foods most of us commonly regard as healthy, including many fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and conventional dairy products. These proteins, which are found in the seeds, grains, skins, rinds, and leaves of plants, are designed by nature to protect them from predators (including humans). Once ingested, they incite a kind of chemical warfare in our bodies, causing inflammatory reactions that can lead to weight gain and serious health conditions.
At his waitlist-only clinics in California, Dr. Gundry has successfully treated tens of thousands of patients suffering from autoimmune disorders, diabetes, leaky gut syndrome, heart disease, and neurodegenerative diseases with a protocol that detoxes the cells, repairs the gut, and nourishes the body. Now, in The Plant Paradox, he shares this clinically proven program with readers around the world.
The simple (and daunting) fact is, lectins are everywhere. Thankfully, Dr. Gundry offers simple hacks we easily can employ to avoid them, including:
Peel your veggies. Most of the lectins are contained in the skin and seeds of plants; simply peeling and de-seeding vegetables (like tomatoes and peppers) reduces their lectin content.
Shop for fruit in season. Fruit contain fewer lectins when ripe, so eating apples, berries, and other lectin-containing fruits at the peak of ripeness helps minimize your lectin consumption.
Swap your brown rice for white. Whole grains and seeds with hard outer coatings are designed by nature to cause digestive distress—and are full of lectins.
With a full list of lectin-containing foods and simple substitutes for each, a step-by-step detox and eating plan, and delicious lectin-free recipes, The Plant Paradox illuminates the hidden dangers lurking in your salad bowl—and shows you how to eat whole foods in a whole new way.",268,"Review
“The Plant Paradox offers a true paradigm shift in the way we think about food. Whether you’re paleo, gluten-free, low-carb or plant-based, Dr. Gundry’s profound insights and practical advice will help reverse both autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease.” (Terry Wahls, MD, author of The Wahls Protocol: A Radical New Way to Treat All Chronic Autoimmune Conditions Using Paleo Principles)

“Once in a generation a doctor and a book comes along that completely changes the way we think about food and our health. Dr. Gundry is that physician and The Plant Paradox is that book. Following his advice, like I do personally, is life changing.” (Tony Robbins, author of the New York Times bestseller Unshakable)

“It is rare that a book on health and nutrition introduces truly novel concepts, and rarer still that it backs them up with solid scientific data and clinical proof of validity―but The Plant Paradox does just that. We all owe Dr. Gundry a debt of gratitude for his insight and dedication to a new level of superb health.” (Dale Bredesen, MD, Professor of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine; Founding President, Buck Institute; and author of The End of Alzheimer's)

“A fresh, learned perspective on eating healthy, The Plant Paradox is profound, clear, and convincing. Much more than just another dietary fad, Dr. Gundry’s scientifically proven approach to restoring a healthy microbiome will reorient your approach to food.” (Kirkus Reviews)

“If you have ‘tried everything’ or you or a family member are still troubled by stubborn pounds, autoimmune disease, or even heart disease, you owe to yourself to read this book. The Plant Paradox is going to dramatically improve lives, it’s that simple.” (Jonathan Carp, MD)

“Fellow panelist Dr. Steven Gundry, author of The Plant Paradox–which argues that certain fruits, vegetables, nuts, and beans are harmful to the body–promised the crowd they would feel better if they wean themselves off their medicine cabinets. Swallowing just one Aleve, he declared, is like “swallowing a hand-grenade.”” (Rina Raphael, )

“He famously helped Gwyneth Paltrow rethink her eating habits, so it was no surprise to see heart surgeon Steven Gundry, MD, onstage at the Goop conferenceover the weekend. And along with admitting that he usually skips breakfast—which is crazy when you think there are coffee-avocado smoothies to be had—the renowned doctor also talked gut health. (We’re listening…)” (Nisha Gopalan, Well + Good)

“Dr. Gundry is a true trailblazer, always at the forefront of scientific knowledge. shows the world what pioneer thinking is about and is a must-read book for anyone interested in being as healthy as nature has designed them to be.” (Alejandro Junger MDbestselling author of and )

“ elegantly explains how plants defend themselves from being consumed by humans, and how eating the wrong ones at the wrong times immeasurably hurts our health. An eye-opening read.” (Mehmet Oz, MD, Professor of Surgery, New York Presbyterian/Columbia University)

After years of living in Los Angeles, I made a pit stop in my hometown in Oklahoma on the way to a new, exciting life in Chicago. It was during my stay at home that I met Marlboro Man, a mysterious cowboy with steely blue eyes and a muscular, work-honed body. A strict vegetarian, I fell hard and fast, and before I knew it we were married and living on his ranch in the middle of nowhere, taking care of animals, and managing a brood of four young children. I had no idea how I'd wound up there, but I knew it was exactly where I belonged.
The Pioneer Woman Cooks is a homespun collection of photography, rural stories, and scrumptious recipes that have defined my experience in the country. I share many of the delicious cowboy-tested recipes I've learned to make during my years as an accidental ranch wife—including Rib-Eye Steak with Whiskey Cream Sauce, Lasagna, Fried Chicken, Patsy's Blackberry Cobbler, and Cinnamon Rolls—not to mention several ""cowgirl-friendly"" dishes, such as Sherried Tomato Soup, Olive Cheese Bread, and CrÈme BrÛlÉe. I show my recipes in full color, step-by-step detail, so it's as easy as pie to follow along.
You'll also find colorful images of rural life: cows, horses, country kids, and plenty of chaps-wearing cowboys.
I hope you get a kick out of this book of mine. I hope it makes you smile. I hope the recipes bring you recognition, accolades, and marriage proposals. And I hope it encourages even the most harried urban cook to slow down, relish the joys of family, nature, and great food, and enjoy life.",3971,"From Publishers Weekly
Blogger-turned-author Drummond gives readers a slice of frontier life in this likeable-enough collection of recipes and dispatches from the Oklahoma ranch she shares with her husband and children. Replicating the step-by-step photography that made her blog such a hit, Drummond walks readers through dishes ranging from simple-Guacamole, Chili, Artichoke Dip-to more complex, such as from-scratch Cinnamon Rolls and Sherried Tomato Soup. Drummond's careful coaching will help anyone intimidated by the kitchen fearlessly crank out favorites like Chicken Fried Steak, Meat Loaf and Rib Eye Steak with Whiskey Cream Sauce. While the recipes are reliable home cooking standards, relentless references to her husband, known as the Marlboro Man, range from distracting to juvenile, giving what could have been a comfort food classic the feel of a junior-high class project.

""The one book you must have, no matter what you’re planning to cook or where your skill level falls.""—New York Times Book Review

Ever wondered how to pan-fry a steak with a charred crust and an interior that's perfectly medium-rare from edge to edge when you cut into it? How to make homemade mac 'n' cheese that is as satisfyingly gooey and velvety-smooth as the blue box stuff, but far tastier? How to roast a succulent, moist turkey (forget about brining!)—and use a foolproof method that works every time?

As Serious Eats's culinary nerd-in-residence, J. Kenji López-Alt has pondered all these questions and more. In The Food Lab, Kenji focuses on the science behind beloved American dishes, delving into the interactions between heat, energy, and molecules that create great food. Kenji shows that often, conventional methods don’t work that well, and home cooks can achieve far better results using new—but simple—techniques. In hundreds of easy-to-make recipes with over 1,000 full-color images, you will find out how to make foolproof Hollandaise sauce in just two minutes, how to transform one simple tomato sauce into a half dozen dishes, how to make the crispiest, creamiest potato casserole ever conceived, and much more.",,,,"['food lab', 'serious eats', 'science behind', 'highly recommend', 'great book', 'alton brown', 'home cook', 'best cookbook', 'cookbook ever', 'writing style', 'sous vide', 'kenji lopez-alt', 'americas test', 'well written', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

From the Back Cover
I'm Pioneer Woman.
And I love to cook.
Once upon a time, I fell in love with a cowboy. A strapping, rugged, chaps-wearing cowboy. Then I married him, moved to his ranch, had his babies . . . and wound up loving it. Except the manure. Living in the country for more than fifteen years has taught me a handful of eternal truths: every new day is a blessing, every drop of rain is a gift . . . and nothing tastes more delicious than food you cook yourself.
The Pioneer Woman Cooks: Food from My Frontier is a mouthwatering collection of the simple-but-scrumptious recipes that rotate through my kitchen on a regular basis, including Perfect Pancakes, Cowgirl Quiche, Sloppy Joes, Italian Meatball Soup, White Chicken Enchiladas, and a spicy Carnitas Pizza that'll win you over for life. There are also some elegant offerings for more special occasions at your house: Osso Buco, Honey-Plum-Soy Chicken, and Rib-Eye Steak with an irresistible Onion-Blue Cheese Sauce. And the decadent assortment of desserts, including Blackberry Chip Ice Cream, Apple Dumplings, and Coffee Cream Cake, will make your heart go pitter-pat in the most wonderful way.
In addition to detailed step-by-step photographs, all the recipes in this book have one other important quality in common: They're guaranteed to make your kids, sweetheart, dinner guests, in-laws, friends, cousins, or resident cowboys smile, sigh, and beg for seconds. (And hug you and kiss you and be devoted to you for life.)
I hope you enjoy, devour, and love this book.
I sure did love making it for you.

The 4-Hour Chef isn’t just a cookbook. It’s a choose-your-own-adventure guide to the world of rapid learning.
#1 New York Times bestselling author (and lifelong non-cook) Tim Ferriss takes you from Manhattan to Okinawa, and from Silicon Valley to Calcutta, unearthing the secrets of the world’s fastest learners and greatest chefs. Ferriss uses cooking to explain “meta-learning,” a step-by-step process that can be used to master anything, whether searing steak or shooting 3-pointers in basketball. That is the real “recipe” of The 4-Hour Chef.
You'll train inside the kitchen for everything outside the kitchen. Featuring tips and tricks from chess prodigies, world-renowned chefs, pro athletes, master sommeliers, super models, and everyone in between, this “cookbook for people who don’t buy cookbooks” is a guide to mastering cooking and life.
The 4-Hour Chef is a five-stop journey through the art and science of learning:
1. META-LEARNING. Before you learn to cook, you must learn to learn. META charts the path to doubling your learning potential.
2. THE DOMESTIC. DOM is where you learn the building blocks of cooking. These are the ABCs (techniques) that can take you from Dr, Seuss to Shakespeare.
3. THE WILD. Becoming a master student requires self-sufficiency in all things. WILD teaches you to hunt, forage, and survive.
4. THE SCIENTIST. SCI is the mad scientist and modernist painter wrapped into one. This is where you rediscover whimsy and wonder.
5. THE PROFESSIONAL. Swaraj, a term usually associated with Mahatma Gandhi, can be translated as “self-rule.” In PRO, we’ll look at how the best in the world become the best in the world, and how you can chart your own path far beyond this book.",10757,"Review

The author distills them into minimal, learnable units and examines how to order the units so as to keep readers engaged in their endeavors.

Her energy soared, she healed her relationship with food, and she got her glow back, both inside and out. Eager to share her realization that the food we put into our bodies has a huge impact on how we look and feel each day, Angela started a blog, ohsheglows.com, which is now an Internet sensation and one of the most popular vegan recipe blogs on the web.

“…incredibly informative and entertaining… Co-authors Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin provide tough-love talk mixed with facts and common sense...

Freedman and Bamouin speak to the reader like a friend who isn't afraid to tell you what's on her mind. They back up their arguments by citing study after study and take the technical talk out of the discussion so as to make a more easily digested point.

This is the first ""diet"" book I've ever read that has made me laugh out loud numerous times. That being said, since no one warned me, I'll let you in on a secret - the book will gross you out. In the same vein as Fast Food Nation, there are graphic descriptions of factory farming and unsanitary dairy farm practices. It was easy for me to put down Fast Food Nation but this book is so funny, I had to keep going.

Almost immediately, I was one of the transformed. In fact, as soon as I got halfway through Chapter 4, ""The Dead, Rotting Decomposing Flesh Diet"", I had to call and change my dinner plans because I decided to go vegan on the spot.

Based on the groundbreaking results of his twenty-year nutritional study, Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease by Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn  illustrates that a plant-based, oil-free diet can not only prevent the progression of heart disease but can also reverse its effects.  Dr. Esselstyn is an internationally known surgeon, researcher and former clinician at the Cleveland Clinic and a featured expert in the acclaimed documentary Forks Over Knives. Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease has helped thousands across the country, and is the book behind Bill Clinton’s life-changing vegan diet.
The proof lies in the incredible outcomes for patients who have followed Dr. Esselstyn's program, including a number of patients in his original study who had been told by their cardiologists that they had less than a year to live. Within months of starting the program, all Dr. Esselstyn’s patients began to improve dramatically, and twenty years later, they remain free of symptoms.
Complete with more than 150 delicious recipes perfect for a plant-based diet, the national bestseller Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease explains the science behind the simple plan that has drastically changed the lives of heart disease patients forever.

“Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Jr., is certainly the father (and the mother) of the now proven hypothesis that you can reverse severe arterial disease (including severe disease of the arteries supposed to nourish your heart). He proved that radical changes in diet (and that alone) cause radical changes in the age and disease of your arteries—and that you can make your arteries much younger.

“Schlosser has a flair for dazzling scene-setting and an arsenal of startling facts . . . Fast Food Nation points the way but, to resurrect an old fast food slogan, the choice is yours.”—Los Angeles Times

In 2001, Fast Food Nation was published to critical acclaim and became an international bestseller. Eric Schlosser’s exposé revealed how the fast food industry has altered the landscape of America, widened the gap between rich and poor, fueled an epidemic of obesity, and transformed food production throughout the world. The book changed the way millions of people think about what they eat and helped to launch today’s food movement.

In a new afterword for this edition, Schlosser discusses the growing interest in local and organic food, the continued exploitation of poor workers by the food industry, and the need to ensure that every American has access to good, healthy, affordable food. Fast Food Nation is as relevant today as it was a decade ago. The book inspires readers to look beneath the surface of our food system, consider its impact on society and, most of all, think for themselves.

Rombauer, Marion Rombauer Becker, Ethan Becker,",4.7,1784,19.99,,28,"“Cooking shouldn’t just be about making a delicious dish—owning the process and enjoying the experience ought to be just as important as the meal itself. The new Joy of Cooking is a reminder that nothing can compare to gathering around the table for a home cooked meal with the people who matter most.” —Joanna Gaines, author of The Magnolia Table

“Generation after generation, Joy has been a warm, encouraging presence in American kitchens, teaching us to cook with grace and humor. This luminous new edition continues on that important tradition while seamlessly weaving in modern touches, making it all the more indispensable for generations to come.” —Samin Nosrat, author of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat

In the nearly ninety years since Irma S. Rombauer self-published the first three thousand copies of Joy of Cooking in 1931, it has become the kitchen bible, with more than 20 million copies in print. This new edition of Joy has been thoroughly revised and expanded by Irma’s great-grandson John Becker and his wife, Megan Scott.

John and Megan developed more than six hundred new recipes for this edition, tested and tweaked thousands of classic recipes, and updated every section of every chapter to reflect the latest ingredients and techniques available to today’s home cooks. Their strategy for revising this edition was the same one Irma and Marion employed: Vet, research, and improve Joy’s coverage of legacy recipes while introducing new dishes, modern cooking techniques, and comprehensive information on ingredients now available at farmers’ markets and grocery stores.

You will find tried-and-true favorites like Banana Bread Cockaigne, Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Southern Corn Bread—all retested and faithfully improved—as well as new favorites like Chana Masala, Beef Rendang, Megan’s Seeded Olive Oil Granola, and Smoked Pork Shoulder. In addition to a thoroughly modernized vegetable chapter, there are many more vegan and vegetarian recipes, including Caramelized Tamarind Tempeh, Crispy Pan-Fried Tofu, Spicy Chickpea Soup, and Roasted Mushroom Burgers. Joy’s baking chapters now include gram weights for accuracy, along with a refreshed lineup of baked goods like Cannelés de Bordeaux, Rustic No-Knead Sourdough, Ciabatta, Chocolate-Walnut Babka, and Chicago-Style Deep-Dish Pizza, as well as gluten-free recipes for pizza dough and yeast breads.

A new chapter on streamlined cooking explains how to economize time, money, and ingredients and avoid waste. You will learn how to use a diverse array of ingredients, from amaranth to za’atar. New techniques include low-temperature and sous vide cooking, fermentation, and cooking with both traditional and electric pressure cookers. Barbecuing, smoking, and other outdoor cooking methods are covered in even greater detail.

This new edition of Joy is the perfect combination of classic recipes, new dishes, and indispensable reference information for today’s home cooks. Whether it is the only cookbook on your shelf or one of many, Joy is and has been the essential and trusted guide for home cooks for almost a century. This new edition continues that legacy.",,,,[]

It’s fun to read, with a recipe for everyone with two eyes, a stomach, and a fork. Frito pie? A chapter called “Sh*t on toast”? Absurd sexy photo shoots with chicken wings? What’s not to love?

“Maybe the best celebrity cookbook of all time.”-- SELF 
 
“Cravings is a perfect cookbook… it’s a must-buy—never daunting, and filled with near-pornographic images of hearty, meaty, cheesy food that would make Gwyneth Paltrow explode. As a culmination of everything Teigen has built over the past few years, it’s brilliant.” – Jezebel
 
“Cravings… lives up to the hype 100 percent.”-- PopSugar 
 
“We love this cookbook. It's full of things we actually want to eat.” -- Refinery 29 

“[Cravings] is dripping with energy and enthusiasm and, most of all, joy. Do not discount the value of joy. It's far too rare in food writing, and I know professionals who could learn a thing or two about joy from Teigen.” -- Epicurious
 
 “Teigen is notoriously funny, and her sense of humor comes through here, as does her self-awareness — she tackles the issue of credibility early and often, always presenting herself more as a cooking enthusiast than as an expert.” --

“When was the last time you laughed out loud at a cookbook? So long ago you can't remember, which is enough of a reason to give Chrissy Teigen's first book a spin. But it's the recipes that'll keep you coming back.” --

When Aaron Franklin and his wife, Stacy, opened up a small barbecue trailer on the side of an Austin, Texas, interstate in 2009, they had no idea what they’d gotten themselves into. Today, Franklin Barbecue has grown into the most popular, critically lauded, and obsessed-over barbecue joint in the country (if not the world)—and Franklin is the winner of every major barbecue award there is.
 
In this much-anticipated debut, Franklin and coauthor Jordan Mackay unlock the secrets behind truly great barbecue, and share years’ worth of hard-won knowledge. Franklin Barbecue is a definitive resource for the backyard pitmaster, with chapters dedicated to building or customizing your own smoker; finding and curing the right wood; creating and tending perfect fires; sourcing top-quality meat; and of course, cooking mind-blowing, ridiculously delicious barbecue, better than you ever thought possible.",1100,"Review
“Aaron Franklin makes the finest barbecue I’ve ever had, barbecue worth waiting for. His work and his words express a truly rare level of commitment and expertise. With Franklin Barbecue, he shares it all—in a book that, fortunately, you don’t have to wait for.”
—Anthony Bourdain 

“I used to think Aaron Franklin was a genius: There was his rise from backyard dabbler to king of Texas pitmasters; his mind-altering brisket that made normally rational people (myself included) wait hours for the chance to eat it; and his insistence that game-changing barbecue doesn’t come from miracles but rather elbow grease. Then he wrote this book and gave all his secrets away. Now everyone—from me to you to your neighbor who can’t grill a chicken breast—will be able to make award-winning barbecue. He’s not a genius anymore; he’s a god.” 
—Andrew Knowlton, restaurant and drinks editor, Bon Appétit

“The most refreshing barbecue book to come along yet. Rather than preaching about ‘one true way,’ Aaron Franklin guides you through all the wood and smoke so that you can find your own style. And instead of just listing ingredients and rattling off generic recipes, these pages tell the story of a place and a barbecue tradition steeped in history. This isn’t just a book about barbecue;
this book is Central Texas barbecue.” 
—Daniel Vaughn, barbecue editor, Texas Monthly, and author of The Prophets of Smoked Meat

 “Pure genius! Aaron Franklin has distilled years’ worth of barbecue knowledge into this book. In it, he exposes the sacred insights of a top pitmaster—information that can otherwise only be learned from long nights spent staring at a fire, shovel in hand, constantly prodding and pinching your meat to figure out that ‘just perfect’ point of doneness. This book is a game changer: read it, and your barbecue will improve overnight!”


“A complete meat-and brisket-cooking education from the country’s most celebrated pitmaster. More than just a recipe book, this is a master course in the fine art of meat smoking, Texas-style.”

Crusty baguettes, mouth-watering pizzas, hearty sandwich loaves, and even buttery pastries can easily become part of your own personal menu, Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day will teach you everything you need to know, opening the eyes of any potential baker.",68222,"From Publishers Weekly
While the phrase artisan bread typically evokes images of labor-intensive sessions and top-notch ingredients, for authors Hertzberg and François it means five minutes. An intriguing concept—high-quality, fresh bread in less time than it takes to boil water. The authors' promises of no kneading, no starter, no proofing yeast and no need for a bread machine is based on the concept of mixed and risen high-moisture dough stored in the fridge for up to two weeks (dough is cut into pieces and popped in the oven for fresh loaves as desired). Note: for those tracking minutes, the five-minutes doesn't include the 20-minute resting time for dough or 30 minutes for baking. After concise, introductory chapters on ingredients, equipment, and tips and techniques, readers are presented with the master recipe, a free-form loaf of French boule that is the model for all breads in the book. Three main chapters—Peasant Loaves, Flatbreads and Pizzas and Enriched Breads and Pastries—are filled with tempting selections and focus on ethnic breads and pastries including Couronne from France; Limpa from Scandinavia; Ksara from Morocco; Broa from Portugal; and Chocolate-Raisin Babka from the Ukraine, but the basics (Oatmeal Bread, Bagels, White Bread) are all here, too. A smattering of companion recipes such as Tuscan White Bean Dip and Portuguese Fish Stew are peppered throughout. While experienced bakers and true gourmands will skip this one, those looking for an innovative approach to making bread just might find it in these recipes. (Nov.)

It will also show you how to how to mix and match basic ingredients with spices and seasonings that take your taste buds on a world tour. The recipes are as simple as possible, without compromising taste, and they've been tested the recipes extensively to minimize work and maximize flavor. Where it makes sense, directions explain how you can cut corners on technique and when you'll have the best results if you follow the instructions to the letter.

|About the author
Surprisingly, Melissa Joulwan’s favorite vegetable is cabbage. Her favorite spice is cumin. Her favorite book is Jane Eyre. Her favorite city is Prague, and her favorite band is Social Distortion. You might have known all of that already if you follow her blog The Clothes Make The Girl. The Clothes Make the Girl is an unusual title for a blog that’s about her tales of triumph and failure in the gym, in the kitchen, in life. She admits to being a sucker for the perfect little black dress and stompy black boots and sparkly what-whats. She may have started the blog going one way and wound up in entirely another. She says that her desire to be fit and healthy is almost matched by her love of punk fashion and high glamour. Well Fed is her second book. Her first is Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track, a memoir of her experiences as one of the founders of the Texas Rollergirls, the original Flat Track Roller Derby league. She has appeared on the Today Show and Good Morning America – in her roller skates and fishnets. These days, she’s hung up her skates, and her workouts are just as likely to include yoga and meditation, as lifting heavy things and trying to stay ahead of the CrossFit stopwatch.

What should we have for dinner? Ten years ago, Michael Pollan confronted us with this seemingly simple question and, with The Omnivore’s Dilemma, his brilliant and eye-opening exploration of our food choices, demonstrated that how we answer it today may determine not only our health but our survival as a species. In the years since, Pollan’s revolutionary examination has changed the way Americans think about food. Bringing wide attention to the little-known but vitally important dimensions of food and agriculture in America, Pollan launched a national conversation about what we eat and the profound consequences that even the simplest everyday food choices have on both ourselves and the natural world. Ten years later, The Omnivore’s Dilemma continues to transform the way Americans think about the politics, perils, and pleasures of eating.",,,,"['omnivores dilemma', 'michael pollan', 'must read', 'food industry', 'well written', 'whole foods', 'fast food', 'food production', 'highly recommend', 'joel salatin', 'food comes', 'industrial food', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

That’s when I saw him—the cowboy—across the smoky room.
I’ll never forget that night. It was like a romance novel, an old Broadway musical, and a John Wayne Western rolled into one. Out for a quick drink with friends, I wasn’t looking to meet anyone, let alone a tall, rugged cowboy who lived on a cattle ranch miles away from my cultured, corporate hometown. But before I knew it, I’d been struck with a lightning bolt . . . and I was completely powerless to stop it.
This isn’t just my love story; it’s a universal tale of passion, romance, and all-encompassing love that sweeps us off our feet.
It’s the story of a cowboy. And Wranglers. And chaps. And the girl who fell in love with them.

Experience the next level of medical revelations. Packed with information you won’t find anywhere else about the Unforgiving Four—the threats responsible for the rise of illness—and the miraculous power of food to heal, this book gives you the ability to become your own health expert, so you can protect yourself, friends, family, and loved ones from symptoms, suffering, and disease. Unleash the hidden powers of fruits and vegetables and transform your life in the process.
ANTHONY WILLIAM, the Medical Medium, has helped tens of thousands of people heal from ailments that have been misdiagnosed or ineffectively treated—or that medical communities can’t resolve. And he’s done it all by listening to a divine voice that literally speaks into his ear, telling him what is at the root of people’s pain or illness and what they need to do to be restored to health.
In his first book, the New York Times bestseller Medical Medium, Anthony revealed how you can treat dozens of illnesses with targeted healing regimens in which nutrition plays a major role. Medical Medium Life-Changing Foods delves deeper into the healing power of over 50 fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, and wild foods that can have an extraordinary effect on health. Anthony explains each food’s properties, the symptoms and conditions it can help relieve or heal, and the emotional and spiritual benefits it brings. And he offers delicious recipes to help you enjoy each food’s maximum benefit, from sweet potatoes with braised cabbage stuffing to honey-coconut ice cream.
YOU’LL DISCOVER:
Why wild blueberries are the “resurrection food,” asparagus is the fountain of youth, and lemons can lift your spirits when you’ve had bad news
The best foods to eat to relieve gallstones, hypertension, brain fog, thyroid issues, migraines, and hundreds more symptoms and conditions
The particular healing powers of kiwis, cucumbers, cat’s claw, coconut, and much more
Insight into cravings, how to use stress to your advantage, and the key role fruit plays in fertility
Much of Anthony’s information is dramatically different from the conventional wisdom of medical communities, so don’t expect to hear the same old food facts rehashed here. Instead, expect to get a whole new understanding of why oranges offer more than just vitamin C—and a powerful set of tools for healing from illness and keeping yourself and your loved ones safe and well.
Here are just a few highlights of what’s inside:
Critical information about the specific factors behind the rise of illness and how to protect yourself and your family
Foods to repair your DNA, boost your immune system, improve your mental clarity, alkalize every body system, shield you from others’ negative emotions, and so much more

The reading was so spot-on, it has taken my healing to an unimagined, deeper, and richer level of health. My weight has dropped healthily, I can enjoy bike-riding and yoga, I’m back in the gym, I have steady energy, and I sleep deeply.

Holding my head heavy in my hands, sobbing uncontrollably at the kitchen table, not knowing which way to turn, I realized I had finally hit a wall. Through the streaming tears and heaving sobs, I whispered what I vowed never to do: ‘I give up.’ I have nothing left in knowing what is next, I pleaded to the darkness. I prayed for answers.
""Calvin’s stomach pain had never ceased after a simple upper respiratory cold and stomach upset in January, during his favorite time of year: snowboarding season. Since then, it had been five months of consistent doctor visits, herbs and supplements, acupuncture and energetic healing work, hypnotherapy and homeopathy, psychology, medical tests and procedures, paperwork and phone calls, lab tests and consultations, medicine and vitamins, more tests, and numerous ER visits in snowstorms—all leading to a dead end and no hope in sight, with my son’s condition only slowly worsening over time.
""I had lost faith. I had lost faith in the medical system, in the human ability to be able to help, to have any answers. I was exhausted physically and emotionally, broken down by the relentlessness of my son’s undiagnosable stomach pain and no hope for healing. I had tried everything I could possibly imagine and more.
""At this point, I was told that it was all in his head and to try the ‘psychiatric route,’ as they believed there was no physical reason for his condition. I had exhausted every possibility over the months of exploration with many, many practitioners across the spectrum and even revisited some of them to ask, ‘Are you sure we have ruled out everything? Are you sure we have not missed something?’
""I refused to give up.
""Although his unexplained stomach pain did not fit in any clear diagnosable box, and only continued to worsen, it was clear everyone else was done with him, as their bedside manners became unsupportive.
""Leaving a medical office one day, pushing my son in a wheelchair (because it was now too painful and tiring for him to walk much) down the long corridor of the medical center from which we had spent many, many hours over many months, my ten-year-old son looked up at me and said, ‘They aren’t on our side, Mom.’
""Through the tears I nodded and said, ‘Don’t you worry, Buddy. I am ALWAYS on your side. I have not given up, and I will not give up. I am not done.’ I tried to hide the uneasiness and the look of ‘Now what?’
""Not long after, I found myself at that kitchen table in despair, praying in the dark. My child was suffering every single day, moaning in pain every single day, and I was helpless, not able to do anything to help ease his suffering, despite the months of determined and persistent efforts. No one understood, no one had the answers, and as much as I knew that it was painful for others to witness, which many friends told me, it was more painful to live in the grueling experiences of a sick child in agonizing pain every day, only to have his condition worsen to being bedridden, with clouded mental faculties that prevented him from reading and doing math work or any work that required mental focus.
""Then, the answer to my prayer arrived through a text from my mother explaining she had found someone who I should check out named Anthony William. I looked him up on his website and I felt chills enter my body, chills of hope as I read through his website. I sent an email explaining my plight. Anthony William knew what was ailing my son within the first three minutes of our phone conversation, explaining that Calvin had a mutated shingles virus inflaming his vagus nerve. This explained the nerve pain and the lack of physical evidence in any blood work or other existing diagnostic tools. It also explained the reason behind the mental/brain struggle in Calvin’s reading and schoolwork.
""Anthony reassured me that this was a physical cause for his ‘mystery illness’ and was NOT psychological. Tears ran down my face—my gut instinct finally being acknowledged as true. He was the ONLY person who had ever been able to pinpoint so confidently, quickly, and accurately a direction for healing.
""Anthony proceeded to flood me with information that would aid in my son’s healing, which I vigorously wrote down. He was deeply caring and reassuring. He was available to me when I needed him for follow-up calls (even in the middle of the night), emotional support, and as my cheerleader to keep me going as Calvin recovered. Anthony understood the intense stress placed on our whole family as we endured the intensity of his painful illness for so long without any progress. He never failed in his delivery to be supportive and compassionate.
""Over the course of the next two months, staying true to the protocol, my son healed. He was back to being himself, an active, engaged, happy, pain-free ten-year-old boy. Five years later, my son continues to thrive without any setbacks in his health. I am forever grateful for Anthony for saving my son’s life, for restoring my faith in the human ability to be of help, and for supporting faith in my own inner wisdom when it comes to my gut instinct as a mother.
""It is clear how deeply committed Anthony is to his work in serving others in order that they may have the possibility to lead healthy, vibrant lives. He truly is a gift to the world.""
— Kristin Cassidy

— Caroline Leavitt, New York Times best-selling author of Cruel Beautiful World, Is This Tomorrow, and Pictures of You

""I had a health reading from Anthony, and he accurately told me things about my body only known to me. This kind, sweet, hilarious, self-effacing, and generous man—also so ‘otherworldly’ and so extraordinarily gifted, with an ability that defies how we see the world—has shocked even me, a medium! He is truly our modern-day Edgar Cayce, and we are immensely blessed that he is with us. Anthony William proves that we are more than we know.""
— Colette Baron-Reid, best-selling author of Uncharted, TV host of Messages from Spirit

""In 2015, my previously healthy five-year-old daughter started to develop neurological issues such as wobbly legs, frequent falls, an inability to walk when going from sitting to standing, general weakness, and decreased strength. She was at the point of thirty leg episodes a day, and it was worsening week by week. We went to different specialists at one of the best children’s hospitals—no answers, other than a neurologist’s  label of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia. Being a nurse for ten years and my medical community not providing me answers about why my daughter was getting worse was a hard pill to swallow. It hit home too hard.
""At first, I was too scared to contact Anthony William about my daughter, because we hadn’t yet ruled out a brain/spine tumor, and I was so scared to hear the truth. But after some time, I got an appointment with Anthony, and he explained everything—that my daughter had a specific virus that he knew about in her brain. In that moment, I felt like I became a different person. Hearing the truth from Anthony William and having a protocol to follow literally changed me forever! I got hope! With my daughter on the protocol, my family and I started to see improvements in her. She stopped falling, was getting stronger, and her leg episodes were fewer and fewer! Now, a year later, she is the strongest she has ever been and can physically function like any six-year-old. I believe angels from above led me to Anthony William just when I needed him the most. Forever grateful!""
— Justyna Siek

""Anthony William changed by son’s life for the better in 2007. My son was lethargic, pale, and struggled with a chronic asthmatic cough. He had a lack of appetite and did not have energy to participate in much activity. After visiting multiple doctors in several different states without any answers except ‘asthma’ and medications to treat the asthmatic symptoms, I was fortunate enough to have a session with Anthony William where he gave me specific information about the source of my son’s problems as well as holistic ways in which to repair them. Nine years later, my son is a high-level athlete who is thriving in all areas of his life. It is hard to express the gratitude I feel toward Anthony William for his invaluable insight that directly led to my son’s amazing recovery into the teenager I always hoped he could be—active, healthy, happy, and enjoying life with a smile on his face and boundless energy!""

• Why plateauing on this diet is actually a sign that you’re on the right track
• Why artificial sweeteners have the same effects as sugar on your health and your waistline
• Why taking antacids, statins, and drugs for high blood pressure and arthritis masks health issues instead of addressing them

The Language of Letting Go
Melody Beattie

January 1
The New Year

Make New Year's goals. Dig within, and discover what you would like to have happen in your life this year. This helps you do your part. It is an affirmation that you're interested in fully living life in the year to come.

Goals give us direction. They put a powerful force into play on a universal, conscious, and subconscious level.
Goals give our life direction.

What would you like to have happen in your life this year? What would you like to do, to accomplish? What good would you like to attract into your life? What particular areas of growth would you like to have happen to you? What blocks, or character defects, would you like to have removed?

What would you like to attain? Little things and big things? Where would you like to go? What would you like to have happen in friendship and love? What would you like to have happen in your family life?

Remember, we aren't controlling others with our goals—we are trying to give direction to life.
What problems would you like to see solved? What decisions would you like to make? What would you like to happen in your career?

What would you like to see happen inside and around you?

Write it down. Take a piece of paper, a few hours of your time, and write it all down—as an affirmation of you, your life, and your ability to choose. Then let it go.

Certainly, things happen that are out of our control. Sometimes, these events are pleasant surprises; sometimes, they are of another nature. But they are all part of the chapter that will be this year in our life and will lead us forward in the story.

The new year stands before us, like a chapter in a book, waiting to be written. We can help write that story by setting goals.

Diagnosed with an autoimmune disease at twenty-two, Danielle Walker spent many years in and out of the hospital and on high dosages of debilitating medications before taking her health into her own hands and drastically changing her diet. In a true lemons-to-lemonade story, Danielle transformed her adversities into opportunities and created her wildly successful blog, Against All Grain, in an effort to help those in need eat well and feel great, without feeling deprived.

With recipes that make cooking for the grain-free family both easy and enjoyable, Meals Made Simple answers the age-old question: “What’s for dinner?” Danielle Walker takes the guesswork out of meal planning with eight weeks’ worth of dinner ideas, complete with full shopping lists and recipes for using up leftovers. Whether we’re moms, students, or business owners, at the end of the day we all want fresh, home-cooked meals that are easy to prepare. And we want lots of variety.

Preparing real foods can be time-consuming and monotonous, but Danielle brings both simplicity and creativity to the everyday meal with an enthusiasm for flavors and textures that are often lacking in easy weeknight dishes. Meals Made Simple includes a variety of slow cooker, one-pot, and thirty-minute meals, as well as ways to create entirely new dishes from leftovers.

As in her critically acclaimed first cookbook, Against All Grain, Danielle offers special “tidbits” to help ensure that your meals turn out picture-perfect. The vibrant flavors and colors in these grain-free dishes, like slow-cooked Pork Ragu, Beef Stroganoff, Peruvian-Style Chicken, Chicken and Rice Casserole, and Barbecue Salmon with Peach Salsa, add delight to any meal and put an end to all those nights of mundane grilled chicken and steamed vegetables. Even the desserts are quick to make, should a craving or a last-minute celebration arise.

Features include

·         make-ahead options

·         8 weeks’ worth of dinner ideas

·         nutritional facts for every recipe

·         shopping lists for fast grocery runs

·         suggestions for how best to use leftovers

·         slow cooker, one-pot, and 30-minute recipes

Meals Made Simple brings culinary excitement to the health enhancing world of low-carb and gluten-free. For anyone who embraces the notion that food matters in terms of health and longevity, this book is a treasure. Author: David Perlmutter MD, - Author, #1 New York Times Bestseller: Source: Grain Brain, The Surprising Truth About Wheat, Carbs, and Sugar - Your Brain's Silent Killers

Some of her popularity might have to do with her easy-to-follow and relatable approach—and the fact that her dairy-free, gluten-free, and Paleo recipes appeal to so many different types of people and dietary concerns... Author: Molly Gallagher, Source: Well+Good

Beautifully presented and clearly explained, Meals Made Simple is a delight for Paleo newbies and longterm Paleo-ites alike. The recipes are straightforward and easy to follow, and I like that there are often tips for using leftovers from other recipes in the book. While many cookbooks leave a trail of half-used jars of obscure ingredients scattered across your kitchen, Danielle actually makes it seem easy to stock your kitchen with versatile Paleo staples, all of which can be used in countless ways....

What’s healthy, uncomplicated and definitely not boring? Well, practically any of self-trained chef Danielle Walker’s recipes in her newest cookbook, Meals Made Simple.

Danielle Walker’s first book --was (and still is) a gangbuster hit, so trust me when I tell you that her second book, Against All Grain: Meals Made Simple, is just as exciting and eye-opening when it comes to eating a gluten free and/or paleo diet. I was looking to try out a recipe or two from the book but while reading it everything looked so amazing I ended up putting tabs on more than half of the pages. Source: Weelicious

|About the author
Food blogger and author of the New York Times best-selling cookbook, Against All Grain (www.againstallgrain.com), Danielle Walker, is the new face of grain-free cooking. A self-trained chef, Danielle tempts a range of appetites with her innovative, accessible Paleo-influenced recipes that are not only healthy and delicious, but are also credited for saving her life. Paying homage to the dishes she loved from her pre-Paleo days, she imaginatively recreates all of her favorites without grains, gluten and most times, dairy.

A Diagnosis and Decision
For months, Danielle suffered from drastic weight loss, joint pain and malnutrition. After countless doctor visits, she was diagnosed with a severe form of Ulcerative Colitis at age 22, just two months after getting married. Despite her expansive array of medications and prednisone steroids, Danielle found herself hospitalized numerous times each year, admitted repeatedly for multiple blood transfusions due to morbidly low hemoglobin levels.

Left with a choice between surgery or a life-long weekly treatment with harsh side effects, Danielle began her own research to explore other options. A friend’s success on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) led Danielle to give it a try, only eating grain-free, sugar-free, starch-free, and unprocessed foods. Although no doctor would support a dietary change as a part of her treatment, Danielle realized that she could take things into her own hands to achieve real results.

Cooking by Necessity
Danielle noticed improvement, but committing to a new, drastically different diet was not easy. When her son was just 9 months old, she had an extreme setback which caused her to be hospitalized yet again and required multiple blood transfusions. She began eliminating more food groups including grains, lactose and legumes, following a plan that closely mimicked the Paleo diet. Seeing drastic progress after just 48 hours, Danielle began dedicating her free time to creating delicious comfort foods that could be enjoyed on a restricted diet. She focuses on flavors and textures, refusing to feel deprived despite her limited food choices.


Danielle started her blog, Against All Grain, to help others suffering from similar ailments continue to enjoy food. Her recipes are all entirely grain-free, and consequently gluten-free, free of refined sugars, and minimal to no dairy. Most are appropriate for those following the Paleo, Primal, SCD, GAPS, and gluten-free lifestyles, and more. With her acquired culinary skills, love for food, and an equal love for journalism, she has become a source of hope for others suffering from similar allergies and autoimmune diseases.

Coveting a large, but loyal following on her blog, Danielle expanded beyond the internet and released her first cookbook, , in July 2013. With a large social media and blog following, Danielle has become a beacon of hope in the food community.

Danielle lives in San Francisco with her husband and son.

—David Winston, RH(AHG), clinical herbalist, ethnobotanist, and author of Adaptogens: Herbs for Strength, Stamina, and Stress Relief

""So many books geared toward those just beginning to explore the world of medicinal plants offer very basic ‘take this herb for that problem’ information, under the assumption that the foundational underpinnings of herbalism are somehow ‘too hard’ for beginners to grasp. Here, in plain English, Rosalee de la Forêt shows us that the way that herbalists choose herbs for individual people with particular imbalances isn’t some magical power or a skill attainable only by those who can devote their lives to intense study. Instead, it is rooted in common sense patterns that anyone can learn to recognize, given a model to do so. That this is done using familiar herbs and spices available to all is an invaluable bonus. A book for everyone.""

For those who are looking to spice up their lives and improve their health, I would say that this is the book for you.""
— Natalie Vickery, herbalist and founder of TheFamilyHerbalist.com

""Rosalee de la Forêt has broken down some of the more complex parts of herbal medicine into clear and straightforward pieces. It’s very practical, but not at the expense of art and beauty. This book will be a classic.""
— Traci Picard, herbalist and founder of FellowWorkersFarm.com

""It’s exciting to watch more and more people becoming empowered in taking better care of themselves and their families with the use of herbs and spices.

Written by Robb Wolf, a research biochemist who traded in his lab coat and pocket protector for a whistle and a stopwatch to become one of the most sought after strength and conditioning coaches in the world. With Robb's unique perspective as both scientist and coach you will learn how simple nutrition, exercise and lifestyle changes can radically change your appearance and health for the better.",36099,"From Publishers Weekly
Asserting that ""modern life causes diabetes, autoimmunity, cancer, neurodegeneration, and infertility,"" the first-time author Wolf, a former student of The Paleo Diet's Lauren Cordain, takes on grains, carbs, vegetarians, misinformation, and other aspects of modern life with a casual, conversational tone (""Keep your poop where it belongs"") that makes even topics like the components of total cholesterol engaging. Wolf's scientific background allows him to fully explain hormones, fats, and the digestive process, and helps him put the fundamentals of evolutionary biology into accessible context. He argues that, in addition to dietary changes, a focus on the quality and duration of sleep and a fitness routine is needed, and photographs accompanied by detailed instructions guide readers through simple exercises. Recognizing the time crunch of modern life, Wolf's program is created to require minimum time and expense. While a grain-free, dairy-free diet may sound difficult to implement, he suggests a commitment-light 30-day trial and provides a four-week menu with simple recipes like Slow Cooker Pork Loin, Chicken Alfredo, and Pizza with a nut-based crust. An extensive list of references, primarily from peer-reviewed journals, lends credence to an intriguing argument.

Starred Review. Dornenberg and Page's follow up to their award-winning What to Drink With What You Eat certainly compliments its predecessor (part of the intent), but works equally well as a standalone reference for cooks of all skill levels. An alphabetical index of flavors and ingredients, the book allows readers to search complimentary combinations for a particular ingredient (over 70 flavors go well with chickpeas; over 100 are listed for oranges), emphasizing the classics (chives with eggs, nutmeg with cream, sardines and olive oil, etc.). Entries for ingredients such as chicken, beets and lamb span multiple pages and feature menu items from chefs such as Grant Achatz of Alinea, Alred Portale of Gotham Bar and Grill and Le Bernardin's Eric Ripert. Regional tastes are well-represented in broad entries for classic German and English flavors, as well as the more fine-tuned flavors of, for example, northern France or West Africa. The listings, combinations and short essays from various chefs on different matches are meant to inspire rather than dictate-there are, in fact, no recipes included. Instead, the volume is meant as a jumping-off point for those comfortable in the kitchen and eager to explore; though experienced cooks and chefs will benefit most, novices will find themselves referring to this handsome volume again and again as their confidence grows.

Creative, self-motivated cooks who don’t demand recipes’ precise prescriptions will cheer the publication of this guide to the kingdom of taste. Addressing the nature of flavor and its role in cooking, the authors have gathered creativity and wisdom from dozens of the world’s best chefs. Page and Dornenburg define the aesthetic of flavor as a combination of taste, mouthfeel, aroma, and a mysterious factor perceived by the other senses and by the diner’s emotions. They then break down in hundreds of tables how ingredients’ flavors relate to one another. For example, the table for apples notes their affinity for cinnamon, pork, rum, and nuts. They also list the most common ingredients of national cuisines. In some cases, they note clashes, such as oysters and tarragon. This is a valuable reference for all aspiring chefs and sets down in print what has often been believed inexpressible. --Mark Knoblauch

From Booklist
*Starred Review* The true definition of a melting pot, it seems, can be found through foods, or so Ottolenghi and Tamimi contend. As former residents of Jerusalem and now well-acclaimed London restaurateurs, they have compiled a luscious, photographic collection of 120 recipes with origins encompassing various religions, countries, and, occasionally, continents. The history of the city and of foods found there are sprinkled throughout the text, as are visuals not only of recipes but also of the people who inhabit Jerusalem and beyond. Expect discourses on the humble aubergine (eggplant); za’atar, a native herb; hummus wars; and even Georgian cuisine. The book’s leisurely pace picks up with the introduction of dishes, some familiar but many not, that include fattoush, latkes, mejadra, clear chicken soup with knaidlach, pan-fried mackerel with golden beetroot and orange salsa, and helbeh (fenugreek cake). Measurements are computed in grams, and, unfortunately, the more exotic ingredients, such as arak and zhoug, might prove elusive to all but the most avid chefs. Yet the passion and skill evident in this collection of Mediterranean cuisine are contagious. --Barbara Jacobs

If you're among them, you may know all too well how little modern medicine can do to alleviate your condition. But that's no reason to give up hope. In this groundbreaking book, Sarah D. Ballantyne, Ph.D., draws upon current medical research and her own battle with an autoimmune disorder to show you how you can become completely symptom-free—the natural way.

The Paleo Approach is the first book ever to explain how to adapt the Paleo diet and lifestyle to bring about a full recovery. Read it to learn why foods marketed as ""healthy""—such as whole grains, soy, and low-fat dairy—can contribute to the development of autoimmune conditions. Discover what you can eat to calm your immune system, reduce inflammation, and help your body heal itself. Find out which simple lifestyle changes—along with changes in diet—will make the biggest difference for your health.

There's no need to worry that ""going Paleo"" will break the bank or require too much time in the kitchen preparing special foods. In The Paleo Approach, Dr. Ballantyne provides expert tips on how to make the switch easily and economically. Complete food lists with strategies for the day-to-day—how stay within your food budget, where to shop for what you need, how to make the most out of your time in the kitchen, and how to eat out—take all the guesswork out of going Paleo. Simple strategies for lifestyle adjustments, including small steps that can make a huge difference, guide you through the most important changes to support healing.

Do you have a complicated condition that requires medical intervention, medication, or supplements? Dr. Ballantyne also walks you through the most useful medical tests, treatments, and supplements (as well as the most counterproductive ones) to help you open a dialogue with your physician.

Features such as these make The Paleo Approach the ultimate resource for anyone suffering from an autoimmune disease. Why suffer a moment longer? Reclaim your health with The Paleo Approach!",7408,,"About the Author
Sarah Ballantyne, Ph.D., earned her doctorate degree in medical biophysics at the age of 26. She spent the next four years doing research on innate immunity and inflammation before becoming a stay-at-home mom. After her second daughter was born, she began to experiment with the Paleo lifestyle. It had an amazing effect on her health. Over time, she healed herself of a long laundry list of physical complaints including irritable bowel syndrome, allergies, and the autoimmune disorder, Lichen Planus, an inflammatory skin condition. Inspired by her success, Dr. Ballantyne created the popular health blog www.ThePaleoMom.com and became co-host of a top-rated podcast, The Paleo View. Her passion for providing straightforward explanations of the science behind her diet and lifestyle recommendations for managing autoimmune disease, plus her love of food and cooking, form the foundations of The Paleo Approach.","['autoimmune disease', 'paleo approach', 'sarah ballantyne', 'highly recommend', 'autoimmune', 'paleo diet', 'well written', 'great book', 'easy to understand', 'science behind', 'leaky gut', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

From the Back Cover
THE DIET EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT!
Developed by noted Miami cardiologist Dr. Arthur Agatston for his patients, THE SOUTH BEACH DIET became a national phenomenon-because it works. It's not low fat. It's not low carbs. It teaches you to use the right carbs and the right fats to change your body chemistry to burn fat, help reduce your cholesterol, and help prevent metabolic syndrome (pre-diabetes). As a result, you'll lose weight quickly and safely.
Dr. Agatston's plan allows you to eat the foods you love-meat and fish, cheese, healthy oils and nuts, vegetables, and the right carbohydrates and sweets. There's no mandatory exercise, and you're never left craving more food. Structured in three simple phases, this may be the easiest diet that you've ever tried.
PHASE ONE: Say goodbye to bad-for-you ""goodies""!
Your cravings will disappear...and so will eight to thirteen pound.
PHASE TWO: Your stomach is visibly smaller and favorite foods are back on the menu!
Your body is burning calories, not storing them!
PHASE THREE: The stage that lasts the rest of your life-normal foods in normal portions.
You will keep your ideal weight...and maintain your health and vitality.
With recipes and meal plans for each phase!

Foods that are revered by traditional weight loss programs, such as turkey, eggs, cauliflower, beans, and tomatoes, may be healthy in a vacuum, but when combined with each person's unique chemistry, they can cause a toxic reaction that triggers weight gain, premature aging, inflammation, and a host of health problems including constipation, migraines, joint pain, and depression.

Successful gluten free recipes require more than just new ingredients. You need new techniques and that's where our test kitchen team can help. We tried thousands of recipes (most were pretty awful) before we figured out the secrets to making favorite foods without gluten. In this landmark book, we tell what works (and why) so you can successfully prepare lasagna, fried chicken, and fresh pasta in your kitchen. And we have reinvented the rules of baking to produce amazing cookies, cakes, breads, biscuits and more.",5220,"Review
Even ultra-experienced gluten-free cooks and bakers will learn something from this thoroughly researched, thoughtfully presented volume. It begins with an introduction to the science of gluten, strategies for replacing wheat in recipes, troubleshooting suggestions, and helpful evaluations of commercial brands of gluten-free flour blends, sandwich bread, and pasta. The editors advise against using more brands than they recommend. Each entry opens with an explanation of ""why this recipe works"" and many include additional tips and variations. And the recipes cover the dishes gluten-free eaters are most likely to crave. There are breakfast recipes, including lemon ricotta pancakes and buttermilk waffles; entrees, such as spaghetti and meatballs, fried chicken, and cheese quiche; and breads: multigrain sandwich bread, dinner rolls, and English muffins. Of course there are desserts, too, from oatmeal-raisin cookies to deep-dish apple pie. The simplicity of the dishes belie the innovation contained in this book--it's a necessary addition to any gluten-free cookbook collection. --Publishers Weekly

In the world of competitive barbecue, nobody’s won more prize money, more trophies, or more adulation than Myron Mixon. And he comes by it honestly: From the time he was old enough to stoke a pit, Mixon learned the art of barbecue at his father’s side. He grew up to expand his parent’s sauce business, Jack’s Old South, and in the process became the leader of the winningest team in competitive barbecue. It’s Mixon’s combination of killer instinct and killer recipes that has led him to three world championships and more than 180 grand championships and made him the breakout star of TLC’s BBQ Pitmasters.

Now, for the first time, Mixon’s stepping out from behind his rig to teach you how he does it. Rule number one: People always try to overthink barbecue and make it complicated. Don’t do it! Mixon will show you how you can apply his “keep it simple” mantra in your own backyard. He’ll take you to the front lines of barbecue and teach you how to turn out ’cue like a seasoned pro. You’ll learn to cook like Mixon does when he’s on the road competing and when he’s at home, with great tips on
 
• the basics, from choosing the right wood to getting the best smoker or grill
• the formulas for the marinades, rubs, injections, and sauces you’ll need
• the perfect ways to cook up hog, ribs, brisket, and chicken, including Mixon’s famous Cupcake Chicken
 
Mixon shares more than 75 of his award-winning recipes—including one for the most sinful burger you’ll ever eat—and advice that will end any anxiety over cooking times and temps and change your backyard barbecues forever. He also fills you in on how he rose to the top of the competitive barbecue universe and his secrets for succulent success.

Praise for Julia Child and Mastering the Art of French Cooking

""Has it really been 40 years since Julia Child rescued Americans from dreary casseroles? This reissue, clad in a handsome red jacket, is what a cookbook should be: packed with sumptuous recipes, detailed instructions, and precise line drawings. Some of the instructions look daunting, but as Child herself says in the introduction, 'If you can read, you can cook.'"" —Entertainment Weekly

“Julia Child paved the way for Chez Panisse and so many others by demystifying French food and by reconnecting pleasure and delight with cooking and eating at the table. She brought forth a culture of American ingredients and gave us all the confidence to cook with them in the pursuit of flavor.” —Alice Waters, Chez Panisse

“Mastering the Art of French Cooking was one of my first introductions to my foundation of understanding the art of French cooking. The combination of reading Julia’s book, working in the kitchen, and watching her television shows helped lead me to my beginnings in serious cuisine. Julia is . . . the grande dame of cooking, who has touched all of our lives with her immense respect and appreciation of cuisine.” —Emeril Lagasse, Emeril’s Restaurant

“Julia has slowly but surely altered our way of thinking about food. She has taken the fear out of the term ‘haute cuisine.’ She has increased gastronomic awareness a thousandfold by stressing the importance of good foundation and technique, and she has elevated our consciousness to the refined pleasures of dining. Through the years her shows have kept me in rapt attention, and her humor has kept me in stitches. She is a national treasure, a culinary trendsetter, and a born educator beloved by all.” —Thomas Keller, The French Laundry

“Julia freed the American public from their fears of cooking French. By doing so, she greatly expanded the audience for all serious food writers. Her demystification prepared that public for the rest of us. I believe that the television shows based on that landmark book did even more to encourage reluctant cooks to try their hands . . . much to our benefit.” —Mimi Sheraton

“1961 A.D. Julia Child’s is published. Her black-and-white TV show on WGBH in Boston soon follows. Child is one of the great teachers of the millennium: She is intelligent and charismatic, and her undistinguished manual skills are not daunting to her viewers. An entire generation of ambitious American home cooks is instantly born.” —Jeffrey Steingarten

J. Virgin (Foreword)",4.2,1178,9.99,15.29,17.74,"In his mid-twenties, Dave Asprey was a successful Silicon Valley multimillionaire. He also weighed 300 pounds, despite the fact that he was doing what doctors recommended: eating 1,800 calories a day and working out 90 minutes a day, six times a week.

When his excess fat started causing brain fog and food cravings sapped his energy and willpower, Asprey turned to the same hacking techniques that made his fortune to ""hack"" his own biology, investing more than $300,000 and 15 years to uncover what was hindering his energy, performance, appearance, and happiness. From private brain EEG facilities to remote monasteries in Tibet, through radioactive brain scans, blood chemistry work, nervous system testing, and more, he explored traditional and alternative technologies to reach his physical and mental prime. The result? The Bulletproof Diet, an anti-inflammatory program for hunger-free, rapid weight loss and peak performance.

The Bulletproof Diet will challenge—and change—the way you think about weight loss and wellness. You will skip breakfast, stop counting calories, eat high levels of healthy saturated fat, work out and sleep less, and add smart supplements.

In doing so, you'll gain energy, build lean muscle, and watch the pounds melt off. By ditching traditional ""diet"" thinking, Asprey went from being overweight and sick in his twenties to maintaining a 100-pound weight loss, increasing his IQ, and feeling better than ever in his forties. The Bulletproof Diet is your blueprint to a better life.",3544,"Review

“So cutting edge that you may draw blood, The Bulletproof Diet will teach you how to avoid the toxins, enjoy more butter, and have tremendous fun as you get lean.” —Sara Gottfried, MD, New York Times bestselling author of The Hormone Cure

“In the high stakes world of peak performance in both the boardroom and locker room, The Bulletproof Dietdelivers on the promise of vibrant health, abundant energy, and heightened awareness to knock it out of the park. It should almost be considered an unfair advantage--that's how good it is!” —Dr. Jeff ""Cornerman"" Spencer, creator of ""The Champion's Blueprint"" and 9-time Performance Coach for the Tour de France

“We all know how easy it is to gain weight and get out of shape. By applying the concepts in The Bulletproof Diet, losing weight and getting in shape will be just as easy. Dave has done the research to understand the intricacies of how our diet went wrong, and then shows us a simple process to turn it all around. Let Dave show you how a great body and amazing health are your birthright, not a pipe dream.” —Doug McGuff, MD, co-author of Body By Science and President of Ultimate Exercise, Inc.

“Dave Asprey is a biohacker extraordinaire--The Bulletproof Diet will make you rethink everything you know about food!” —Steven Kotler, New York Times bestselling author of Rise of Superman and Abundance and director of research for the Flow Genome Project

“I've searched for years to find a way of eating that would help me on long tours with my band where I need to perform at a high energy level night after night on little sleep. Bulletproof is literally food for performance, and is going to help people lead healthier lives with more physical vitality and more mental clarity.” —Stephan Jenkins, lead singer, songwriter, and guitarist for Third Eye Blind

“I need a lot of sustained energy and consistency for my work and Bulletproof always delivers. All the coffee I've tried gives you that crash...except Bulletproof. It has become a way of life for me.” 

“Today we have the power to measure what works. Dave Asprey uses this new power in his quest to biohack the human body to improve how we think and how we feel. This capacity is groundbreaking and will lead to measurably improve human performance.” 

“I thought I knew a lot about health and nutrition, but Dave Asprey introduced me to the real truth about modern food, and most importantly, the beauty of clean, powerful saturated fat.” 

“Learning to biohack your health is one of the smartest things you can ever do. Dave Asprey is the best person on the planet for showing you how. This fascinating and easy-to-read book will not only expose harmful dietary misinformation but provide simple and effective solutions so you can finally take control of your health and live life with gusto!”

But food is more than just nourishment; food is tradition, food is love, and most importantly, food is a celebration. The mere thought of eating a particular meal or the smell of a favorite childhood dish can evoke positive memories, whether it’s a simple Sunday dinner with family or a major life event.

When you begin following the ketogenic diet, whether your goal is to promote weight loss, improve blood markers, or just enhance overall health and well-being, it’s easy to forget to enjoy food. Some people fall into a drab routine of consuming the same dishes over and over, which can lead to boredom and frustration—and ultimately to the desire to fall back into old, poor eating habits. With Keto Comfort Foods, Maria Emmerich reassures everyone on the keto diet that it isn’t difficult at all to recreate those favorite foods and meals in healthy ways—you just need to use a little creativity. By using clever low- or no-calorie substitutions for sugar and scrubbing all recipes clean of gluten-containing additives, Maria has created an incredible resource for comforting home-cooked meals that are safe enough for everyone in the family and delicious enough for the most discerning eaters. These recipes are sure to become new family favorites!

In Keto Comfort Foods, Maria Emmerich has compiled her most soul-warming, happiness-invoking recipes. The book’s more than 170 tantilizing, hearty comfort food recipes include everything from cinnamon rolls to steak fries, and from chicken cordon bleu to tiramisu cheesecake. Maria has covered all the bases, giving you the recipes and tips you need to make delicious and healthy versions of your favorite dishes. ",767,,"About the Author

Like many physicians, Dr. Terry Wahls focused on treating her patients’ ailments with drugs or surgical procedures—until she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2000. Within three years, her back and stomach muscles had weakened to the point where she needed a tilt-recline wheelchair. Conventional medical treatments were failing her, and she feared that she would be bedridden for the rest of her life.
 
Dr. Wahls began studying the latest research on autoimmune disease and brain biology, and decided to get her vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids from the food she ate rather than pills and supplements. Dr. Wahls adopted the nutrient-rich paleo diet, gradually refining and integrating it into a regimen of neuromuscular stimulation. First, she walked slowly, then steadily, and then she biked eighteen miles in a single day. In November 2011, Dr. Wahls shared her remarkable recovery in a TEDx talk that immediately went viral. Now, in The Wahls Protocol, she shares the details of the protocol that allowed her to reverse many of her symptoms, get back to her life, and embark on a new mission: to share the Wahls Protocol with others suffering from the ravages of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune conditions.",1516,"Review

More than a rock star, Eric Clapton is an icon, a living embodiment of the history of rock music. Well known for his reserve in a profession marked by self-promotion, flamboyance, and spin, he now chronicles, for the first time, his remarkable personal and professional journeys.

Born illegitimate in 1945 and raised by his grandparents, Eric never knew his father and, until the age of nine, believed his actual mother to be his sister. In his early teens his solace was the guitar, and his incredible talent would make him a cult hero in the clubs of Britain and inspire devoted fans to scrawl “Clapton is God” on the walls of London’s Underground. With the formation of Cream, the world's first supergroup, he became a worldwide superstar, but conflicting personalities tore the band apart within two years. His stints in Blind Faith, in Delaney and Bonnie and Friends, and in Derek and the Dominos were also short-lived but yielded some of the most enduring songs in history, including the classic “Layla.”

During the late sixties he played as a guest with Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan, as well as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and longtime friend George Harrison. It was while working with the latter that he fell for George’s wife, Pattie Boyd, a seemingly unrequited love that led him to the depths of despair, self-imposed seclusion, and drug addiction. By the early seventies he had overcome his addiction and released the bestselling album 461 Ocean Boulevard, with its massive hit “I Shot the Sheriff.” He followed that with the platinum album Slowhand, which included “Wonderful Tonight,” the touching love song to Pattie, whom he finally married at the end of 1979. A short time later, however, Eric had replaced heroin with alcohol as his preferred vice, following a pattern of behavior that not only was detrimental to his music but contributed to the eventual breakup of his marriage.

In the eighties he would battle and begin his recovery from alcoholism and become a father. But just as his life was coming together, he was struck by a terrible blow: His beloved four-year-old son, Conor, died in a freak accident. At an earlier time Eric might have coped with this tragedy by fleeing into a world of addiction. But now a much stronger man, he took refuge in music, responding with the achingly beautiful “Tears in Heaven.”

Clapton is the powerfully written story of a survivor, a man who has achieved the pinnacle of success despite extraordinary demons. It is one of the most compelling memoirs of our time.",33859,"Review
“Like the bluesmen who inspired him, Clapton has his share of scars... his compelling memoir is... a soulful performance.”
—People

 “An absorbing tale of artistry, decadence, and redemption.”
—Los Angeles Times

“One of the very best rock autobiographies ever.”
—Houston Chronicle

“A glorious rock history.”
—New York Post

“This book does what many rock historians couldn’t: It debunks the legend... puts a lie to the glamour of what it means to be a rock star.”
—Greg Kot, Chicago Tribune

“Strong stuff. Clapton reveals its author’s journey to self-acceptance and manhood. Anyone who cares about the man and his music will want to take the trip with him.”
—Anthony DeCurtis, Rolling Stone

“Clapton is honest... even searing and often witty, with a hard-won survivor’s humor... an honorable badge of a book.”


“Riveting”


“An even, unblinking sensibility defines the author’s voice.”


“An unsparing self-portrait.”

Hi, y’all!

This book is my proudest achievement so far, and I just have to tell y’all why I am so excited about it. It’s a book of classic dishes, dedicated to a whole new generation of cooks—for every bride, graduate, and anyone who has a love of a great Southern meal. My family is growing and expanding all the time. We’re blessed with marriages and grandbabies, and so sharing these recipes for honest, down-home dishes feels like passing a generation’s worth of stovetop secrets on to my family, and yours.

I’ve been cooking and eating Southern food my whole life, and I can tell you that every meal you make from this book will be a mouthful of our one-of-akind spirit and traditions. These recipes showcase the diversity and ingenuity of Southern cuisine, from Cajun to Low-Country and beyond, highlighting the deep cultural richness of our gumbos and collards, our barbecues and pies. You may remember a few beloved classics from The Lady & Sons, but nearly all of these recipes are brand-new—and I think you’ll find that they are all mouthwateringly delicious. It is, without a doubt, a true Southern cooking bible.

I sincerely hope that this book will take its place in your kitchen for many years to come, as I know it will in mine. Here’s to happy cooking—and the best part, happy eating, y’all!

Fifty chicken recipes, each more seductive than the last, in a book that makes every dinner a turn-on. 
 
“I want you to see this. Then you’ll know everything. It’s a cookbook,” he says and opens to some recipes, with color photos. “I want to prepare you, very much.” This isn’t just about getting me hot till my juices run clear, and then a little rest. There’s pulling, jerking, stuffing, trussing. Fifty preparations. He promises we’ll start out slow, with wine and a good oiling . . . Holy crap. “I will control everything that happens here,” he says. “You can leave anytime, but as long as you stay, you’re my ingredient.” I’ll be transformed from a raw, organic bird into something—what? Something delicious.
 
So begins the adventures of Miss Chicken, a young free-range, from raw innocence to golden brown ecstasy, in this spoof-in-a-cookbook that simmers in the afterglow of E.L. James’s sensational Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. Like Anastasia Steele, Miss Chicken finds herself at the mercy of a dominating man, in this case, a wealthy, sexy, and very hungry chef.  

And before long, from unbearably slow drizzling to trussing, Miss Chicken discovers the sheer thrill of becoming the main course. A parody in three acts—“The Novice Bird” (easy recipes for roasters), “Falling to Pieces” (parts perfect for weeknight meals), and “Advanced Techniques” (the climax of cooking)—Fifty Shades of Chicken is a cookbook of fifty irresistible, repertoire-boosting chicken dishes that will leave you hungry for more.

With memorable tips and revealing photographs, Fifty Shades of Chicken will have you dominating dinner.",3359,"Amazon.com Review
Featured Recipe: Dripping Thighs
The way his apron hangs from his hips already has me all wobbly. But as he coats my thighs with sticky liquid I can hardly contain myself. Is it the wine, or is my aroma starting to drive him crazy too? He heats me up fast, it won’t take much too?
He heats me up fast, it won’t take much to finish me off now. His lips quirk up to a smile. My own juices are mixing with the coating and running all over the place. I get the strangest, sweetest, hedonistic feeling up and down. It’s epicureanism run wild!
He spreads my thighs out on a plate. Sticky hands and at least five wet napkins. What will the housekeeper think? Who cares?
Ingredients
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, patted dry with paper towels
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 teaspoon plus pinch coarse kosher salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 sweet onion, thinly sliced

There are meats, fish, sides, soups, starters, casseroles, slow cooker recipes, breakfast dishes, and even desserts to satisfy any sweets craving you might have, all with virtually no sugar.  If you are low carb, paleo, are wanting to keep autoimmune issues at bay, or just want to lose extra weight, Eat Happy gives you comfort food where you won’t miss the sugars or grains so your body and brain can feel happy from eating real foods. 

In 2012, after almost ten years of being gluten free due to celiac, Anna Vocino found she was gaining weight faster than a tick on a labradoodle.  Turns out the culprit wasn’t overeating or too much fat in the diet, but the pesky sugars and grains in all those gluten free comfort foods.  When Anna started podcasting with Fitness Confidential author Vinnie Tortorich, she adapted her entire way of eating to go what Tortorich coined: NSNG—No Sugars No Grains.  Sure enough, the weight dropped off, the inflammation due to celiac finally calmed down, and for the first time in her life, she learned what it meant to be truly happy about food.

All of Anna’s recipes are delicious, easy to make, and so satisfying, you won’t even know you’re eating healthy.  Craving rich, decadent chocolate pots with fresh cream that are delicious but not fattening?  Wanna make a grain-free pizza crust that actually helps you lose weight?  Dying for pancakes, but you’ve committed to avoiding carbs?  How about hearty shepherd’s pie, tater tots, sizzling ginger rice, all made with cauliflower instead of high carb rice and potatoes?  Eat Happy offers low carb comfort foods to please the entire family.",3000,"Review
""I've been recommending Anna's recipes to my celiac patients for years. And it's true, they come back happy. I'm happy, too, because their blood tests (glucose, triglycerides, HDL and particle sizes) get better.

—Eater National

""Legendary Portland baker Ken Forkish (of the watershed Ken's Artisan Bakery and much-loved Ken's Artisan Pizza) has joined the ranks of the lauded letterers with his mammoth new cookbook Water Flour Salt Yeast: The Fundamentals of Artisan Bread and Pizza. In Water Flour Salt Yeast, he aims to bring the spirit and quality of his famous crusty, blistered breads to the passionate home baker using those four titular ingredients.""

“Exceptionally detailed and clearly written with dedicated bakers in mind. . . . Cooks and students who are serious about the craft of bread baking will definitely want to check out this title.”
—Library Journal

""Forkish's instructions are clear, concise and incredibly precise... For true artisan bread lovers -- and homemade pizza fanatics -- this book sets a new standard.""
—Oregonian, June 25, 2012

""Divided into four sections (“The Principles of Artisan Bread,” “Basic Bread Recipes,” “Levain Bread Recipes,” and “Pizza Recipes”), with recipes broken down by breads made with store-bought yeast, breads made with long-fermented simple doughs, and doughs made with pre-ferments, the book presents recipes accessible to novices, while providing a different approach for making dough to experienced bakers. Plenty of step-by-step photographs, along with a chapter outlining “Great Details for Bread and Pizza,” make this slim work a rival to any bread-baking tome. A variety of pizza recipes, including sweet potato and pear pizza and golden beets and duck breast “prosciutto” pizza, (along with an Oregon hazelnut butter cookie recipe), end the title and inspire readers to put on the apron and get out the flour.""


 “Ken Forkish’s story is as unique, interesting, and delicious as his famous breads and pizzas. The man abandoned his past, courageously stepped off the cliff and followed his passion, and the result has been a gift to all of us: great breads, fabulous pizzas, and now this beautiful book——in which he reveals all.”

 
“Ken nails it, end of story, when it comes to the best levain bread or the thinnest, most perfect pizza crust you’ve ever had. He has set the bar for Portland bakeries—that’s why we use his bread at Le Pigeon. For anybody looking to bake amazing bread at home, this book is a must-have.”

           
“This fun book offers more than just top-quality bread. reveals all the formulas, processes, tips, and tricks Ken established in his years of experience as a professional baker. But most importantly, it teaches home bakers how to create their own bread using multiple schedules and ingredient combinations. Hey—all that without having to get up to bake in the middle of the night.”

 
“Ken Forkish is an artisan for our times, and the kind of ‘handcraft-it-yourself’ dreamer who makes Portland, Oregon, one of America’s top food destinations. This book is a handsome expression of his bread-baking vision: Forkish is a man unbound, obsessed by the science of fermentation, and excitedly sharing hard-won secrets and exacting recipes from his celebrated sourdough laboratory.”

Jacob Tomsky never intended to go into the hotel business. As a new college graduate, armed only with a philosophy degree and a singular lack of career direction, he became a valet parker for a large luxury hotel in New Orleans. Yet, rising fast through the ranks, he ended up working in “hospitality” for more than a decade, doing everything from supervising the housekeeping department to manning the front desk at an upscale Manhattan hotel. He’s checked you in, checked you out, separated your white panties from the white bed sheets, parked your car, tasted your room-service meals, cleaned your toilet, denied you a late checkout, given you a wake-up call, eaten M&Ms out of your minibar, laughed at your jokes, and taken your money. In Heads in Beds he pulls back the curtain to expose the crazy and compelling reality of a multi-billion-dollar industry we think we know.
Heads in Beds is a funny, authentic, and irreverent chronicle of the highs and lows of hotel life, told by a keenly observant insider who’s seen it all. Prepare to be amused, shocked, and amazed as he spills the unwritten code of the bellhops, the antics that go on in the valet parking garage, the housekeeping department’s dirty little secrets—not to mention the shameless activities of the guests, who are rarely on their best behavior. Prepare to be moved, too, by his candor about what it’s like to toil in a highly demanding service industry at the luxury level, where people expect to get what they pay for (and often a whole lot more). Employees are poorly paid and frequently abused by coworkers and guests alike, and maintaining a semblance of sanity is a daily challenge.
Along his journey Tomsky also reveals the secrets of the industry, offering easy ways to get what you need from your hotel without any hassle. This book (and a timely proffered twenty-dollar bill) will help you score late checkouts and upgrades, get free stuff galore, and make that pay-per-view charge magically disappear. Thanks to him you’ll know how to get the very best service from any business that makes its money from putting heads in beds. Or, at the very least, you will keep the bellmen from taking your luggage into the camera-free back office and bashing it against the wall repeatedly.",76547,"Review
Praise for Heads in Beds:

""Heads in Beds is Mr. Tomsky’s highly amusing guidebook to the dirty little secrets of the hospitality trade. But it is neither a meanspirited book nor a one-sided one.... [H]e winds up sounding like an essentially honest, decent guy. And his observations about character are keen, perhaps because he’s seen it all.... If this were simply a travel book of the news-you-can-use ilk, it would be of only minor interest. But Mr. Tomsky turns out to be an effervescent writer, with enough snark to make his stories sharp-edged but without the self-promoting smugness that sinks so many memoirs.... Heads in Beds embraces the full, novelistic breadth of hotel experience.... [Tomsky] is no longer a hotel employee and now, with good reason, thinks of himself as a writer.""
—Janet Maslin, New York Times


""For those of us who'd rather live in good hotels than in our own homes, oh Lordy, is this ever a horrifyingly good time. It's the sort of equivalent of WebMD for hypochondriacs: You know you're learning way more than is good for you, but you just can't stop reading. Tomsky, who may be an even better writer than a hotelier (and he's a damn good hotelier) has worked every job and every shift; he takes us into the bowels (sometimes literally) of the hotel business, with all the pomp and circumstance, the hidden filth, and the fears and aspirations and secrets of guests and staff alike.""—Judith Newman, People (4 Stars)


""For the uninitiated, staying at a luxury hotel can be a little intimidating.... [But] front desk raconteur Jacob Tomsky is here to help. His sharp-witted, candid new book, Heads in Beds, demystifies the world of high-end hospitality.... Coarse, smart and wickedly funny, the author delivers hilarious caricatures of the hotel guests and colleagues he has encountered over the years.... Tightly written and laced with delicious insider tips.""—John Wilwol, Washington Post


""A wonderfully indiscreet veteran of the hospitality industry, Jacob Tomsky knows his way around a hotel.""


""Room upgrades. Free movies. Late checkouts. Jacob Tomsky promises readers the keys to the hotel industry kingdom in his tell-all book, . The one-time philosophy major has spent more than a decade working in the industry and, like room service, he delivers the goods.... Beyond tips, Tomsky has packed his book with outrageous anecdotes about guests...[and] the hotel staff too.... Tomsky has only worked at hotels in New Orleans and New York, so readers may wonder if his tips will work anywhere else. Maybe they will, maybe they won’t. But his stories are so good, it almost doesn’t matter.""


“Jacob Tomsky is a star. The kid writes like a dream. is hilarious, literate, canny, indignant and kind—revealing an author who manages somehow to be both a total hustler and a complete humanitarian. I love this book. Keep an eye on this writer. I’m telling you, he’s a star.”



“And I thought I had it bad when I worked in restaurants! is a hilarious, informative, and naughty peek at what really happens behind the glitz and glamour of the hotel experience. Not content with dispensing advice on how to get a better room or avoiding the vengeful wrath of bellhops, maids, doormen, and front-desk clerks, Tomsky also spins a touching yarn on how he kept his dignity and humanity intact while dealing with insufferable guests, Expedia wannabes, predatory hotel managers, conniving coworkers, and the occasional pervert. After reading this book, you’ll become either a better-educated hotel guest who constantly receives great service—or realize why you always get that noisy room by the elevator shaft. As a survivor of America’s dysfunctional hospitality industry, I highly recommend this book.”



“In pulling the musty curtains back on the seedy hotel business, provides first-rate insights for all grades of travelers. But the real revelation here is Jacob Tomsky, whose writing combines presidential suite talent with rack-rate, smoking-room, vending-machine-down-the-hall edge.”



Readable and often engaging.... [W]hen the author is passionate about his career and is able to express his passion on the page, it can be a joy to read... hilarious.""


""Comparisons to Anthony Bourdain’s (2000) are inevitable…. [B]oth Tomsky and Bourdain purport to expose the underbelly of service industries with which most readers are familiar, hotels and restaurants. But where Bourdain is all rock ’n’ roll, egotistical bluster, Tomsky is surprisingly earnest and sympathetic; there are, after all, no television programs called . He wants your respect, not your adulation…. Indeed, it would be easy to pen a book about crazy hotel guests. But this memoir succeeds, instead, in humanizing the people who park our cars, clean our hotel rooms, and carry our luggage. You will never not tip housekeeping or your bellhop again. Tomsky fell into hotel work and proved to be rather good at it; the same can be said for his writing.""


Those who want a hotel up-grade, who must make a same-day room cancellation without getting charged, or wonder why hotel water sometimes tastes like lemon Pledge need look no further than Tomsky's memoir, a collection of stories, memories, and secrets about the hospitality business.  Bouncing around various hotel jobs...for more than 10 years, he's got the skinny that would make most travel sites blush.... But this is more than a collection of trade secrets; it's a colorful tale filled with vibrant characters from crazy bellmen to even crazier guests.  Tomsky is a solid storyteller who is able to intricately detail all the insanity surrounding him.""


With incredibly witty, from-the-gut prose, Mr. Tomsky provides an inside scoop on the good, the bad, and the incredibly ugly happenings that go on behind closed hotel doors—as well as front desk antics that happen right before your untrained, naïve eyes....  A very fun, entertaining read. It is incredibly relatable, not only for a consumer, but also for anyone who has worked in a public-oriented service industry. Despite his brash language, or perhaps in spite of it, the author comes across as sincere and personable with the patience of a saint—or at least he’s really good at faking it. Though it seems he was very good at this job, it’s about time for Jacob Tomsky to move on to bigger and better things. If this book is any indication, writing will be his next calling.""


""Tomsky shines in...this funny and profane memoir.""


""After the party, it’s the hotel lobby…. and that’s where things get real. Jacob Tomsky’s hilariously irreverent memoir chronicles the all-work, no-sleep, but never dull lifestyle of the young hotelier and the innermost workings of high-end hotels...[and] shares five-star advice for your next check-in.""


"" is at turns hilarious, sad, too revealing, naughty, frightening and wildly fun. Tomsky proves to be a smart writer. His voice is warm and accessible, but he's also pleasantly snarky and potty-mouthed. He lets the reader see him at his smarmy, smooth-operating best and his filthy, fed-up worst. (And the book includes lots of tips, like how to eat and drink everything in your minibar for free, how to get extra amenities, and all of the things a hotel guest should never say to a front desk agent.)""

For example, take time to get acquainted with a new slow cooker, fill it two-thirds full for best results, and try out recipes for the first time when at home for the day. And she dispels two big myths: that her beloved machine is a winter-time appliance and that it’s mainly just for beef stew. Fuggedaboutit. True, many of the 250 recipes are for main dishes made with chicken, turkey, pork, or beef. But she gives even more space to pasta, soups, quiches, appetizers, breakfasts, breads, and desserts. Why not wake up to steel-cut oatmeal that’s been slow cooking overnight? The slow cooker can even bake peach cobbler or a fudgy chocolate cake. Each recipe comes with a photo, some (such as mashed potatoes) get a quick and easy label, and several get a bonus tip from Good (such as cooking wine is wine with salt added). With , the latest Fix-It and Forget-It cookbook is .

Food. There's plenty of it around, and we all love to eat it. So why should anyone need to defend it?

Because in the so-called Western diet, food has been replaced by nutrients, and common sense by confusion--most of what we’re consuming today is longer the product of nature but of food science. The result is what Michael Pollan calls the American Paradox: The more we worry about nutrition, the less healthy we see to become. With In Defense of Food, Pollan proposes a new (and very old) answer to the question of what we should eat that comes down to seven simple but liberating words: ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."" Pollan’s bracing and eloquent manifesto shows us how we can start making thoughtful food choices that will enrich our lives, enlarge our sense of what it means to be healthy, and bring pleasure back to eating.

NUMBER ONE NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER WINNER OF THE JAMES BEARD FOUNDATION AWARD FOR WRITING AND LITERATURE 
From a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter at The New York Times comes the explosive story of the rise of the processed food industry and its link to the emerging obesity epidemic. Michael Moss reveals how companies use salt, sugar, and fat to addict us and, more important, how we can fight back. 
In the spring of 1999, the heads of the world's largest processed food companies gathered at Pillsbury headquarters in Minneapolis for a secret meeting. On the agenda: the emerging epidemic of obesity, and what to do about it. 
Increasingly, the salt-, sugar-, and fat-laden foods these companies produced were being linked to obesity, and a concerned Kraft executive took the stage to issue a warning: There would be a day of reckoning unless changes were made. When he was done, the most powerful person in the room - the CEO of General Mills - stood up to speak, clearly annoyed. And by the time he sat down, the meeting was over. 
In Salt Sugar Fat, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Michael Moss shows how we got here. Featuring examples from some of the most recognizable (and profitable) companies and brands of the last half century - including Kraft, Coca-Cola, Lunchables, Kellogg, Nestlé, Oreos, Cargill, Capri Sun, and many more - Moss' explosive, empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous, often eye-opening research.

The Diet: 4 Easy Steps to Permanent Weight Loss

Phase one: Attack
Using Dr. Dukan's True Weight calculator, dieters determine a reasonable and healthy weight loss goal. Then they begin the Dukan Attack phase a two-to-seven-day period during which only unlimited lean protein and a daily Oat bran galette (or pancake) are consumed and dramatic weight loss is achieved.
 
Phase Two: Cruise
Dieters alternate days of unlimited lean protein with days of protein combined with healthful vegetables until they reach their True Weight.
 
Phase Three: Consolidation
Dieters stay on this phase for 5 days for every pound lost. At this point the diet allows unlimited protein and vegetables, and other foods (such as cheese and bread) are reintroduced.  Dieters are also allowed two weekly celebration meals to stave off boredom.
 
Phase Four: Stabilization
This is the maintenance portion of the plan, in which followers are allowed to eat whatever they like without regaining weight--provided that they follow 3 unbreakable rules including eating only unlimited lean protein one set day per week. 
 
For each phase, The Dukan Diet offers clear simple guidelines for long term success.  The Dukan Diet is the perfect diet for people who want fast weight loss, that can be maintained without counting calories or weighing portions.",27276,,"About the Author

The Dukan Diet

Thirty-five years have passed since my life-changing encounter with the obese gentleman. Since then, I have devoted my work to helping thousands of men and women lose pounds and stabilize their weight.

Like all my French medical colleagues, I was trained that calories counted and low-calorie diets were the way to lose weight. Every type of food was allowed in moderate quantities. Nowadays, what I know and practice I have learned through direct daily contact with flesh-and- blood human beings who have constant cravings to eat.

I very quickly realized that it was not by accident that an individual was overweight. Their appetite and their apparent lack of restraint were a camouflage concealing a need to find comfort in food. This need is all the more overwhelming as it is connected to our survival mechanisms, which are as archaic as they are instinctive. It soon became obvious to me that I could not make an overweight person lose weight and stay slim simply by giving sound advice, even if that advice was based on common sense and scientific research.

Support is what overweight people determined to lose weight really want and is what they need from a counselor or a method-support so that they are not left alone to face the ordeal of dieting, which deliberately goes against their own instinct for survival.

What overweight individuals are looking for is an outside will, a decision maker who walks ahead of them offering guidance and specific instructions, because what overweight people most hate and simply cannot do is decide for themselves when and how they are going to deprive themselves of food.

As for managing their weight, overweight individuals will admit without shame-and why should there be any-that they are powerless when it comes to controlling what they eat. People from every social and economic background have all sat in front of me and described themselves as being astonishingly weak when it comes to food.

Obviously, most of them have found in food an easy ""escape valve"" through which they can release excess tension, stress, and life's all too frequent disappointments. Any logical, reasonable, and rational instructions just cannot stand up to those pressures-at least not for long.

During my years of practice, I have seen many diets come and go. From analyzing these diets and the reasons behind their various successes, as well as the efforts of my own patients, I am convinced of the following: Overweight people who want to lose weight need a fast- acting diet that brings immediate results, fast enough to strengthen and maintain their motivation. They also need precise goals, set by an outside instructor, with a series of levels to aim for so that they can see their efforts and compare them with the results expected. However, I have also observed the strength of my patients' resolve at certain times in their lives and then seen how easily they lose heart when the results do not match their efforts.

Most of the spectacular diets that rocketed to success in recent years did in fact have that fast-off-the-mark effect and delivered the promised results. Unfortunately, their instructions and guidance faded away once the book was closed, leaving the overweight individual once again all alone on the slippery slope of temptations, and the cycle would start all over again. Once the goal was reached, all these diets, even the most original and inventive, abandoned their followers with the same old commonsense advice about moderation and balance that a formerly overweight person will never manage to follow.

None of these famous diets managed to find a way of protecting and guiding individuals during the period that follows their weight loss, giving advice and precise, simple, and effective landmarks like those that made their initial program so successful.

People who have lost weight know instinctively that on their own, and without any support, they will not be able to preserve this victory. They also know that left to their own devices, the pounds will creep back on. They need instructions that are simple, specific, effective, and not too frustrating-guidelines that can be followed for the rest of their life.

Dissatisfied with the majority of the diets in vogue, which are only concerned with a dazzling but short-lived victory, and aware of the ineffectiveness of low-calorie diets and the kind of commonsense advice that despite all the evidence hopes to reform overeaters into careful eaters, I developed my own weight loss diet. Years of medical practice allow me to consider it both the most effective and easy-to- follow diet available today.

I realize that the preceding statement may make me appear immodest. But I will take that risk because it is my most heartfelt conviction, and not saying so in the face of the growing scourge of weight control problems would amount to a failure to assist people in danger.

The Dukan Diet takes into account everything that is essential for the success of any weight loss program:

It offers overweight people trying to lose weight a system with specific instructions that get them on track, with stages and objectives, leaving no room for ambiguity or deviation. The initial weight loss is substantial and sufficiently rapid to launch the diet and instill lasting motivation. It is a low-frustration diet. Weighing food portions and calorie counting are banned, and it allows you total freedom to eat a certain number of popular foods. It is a comprehensive weight loss program, an integrated whole that you either take or leave. The diet can be broken down into four successive phases:

1. The Attack phase. The initial Attack phase is a pure protein diet that creates a stunning kick start, almost as quick as fasting or powdered protein diets but without their drawbacks. 2. The Cruise phase. In the Cruise phase, pure protein days alternate with days in which you eat pure proteins plus certain allowed vegetables. This phase lets you reach your chosen weight. 3. The Consolidation phase. The Consolidation phase is designed to prevent the rebound effect that occurs after any rapid weight loss. This is a period of high vulnerability when the body has a tendency to very easily regain those lost pounds. The duration of this phase is based on a precise formula: 5 days for every pound lost. 4. The Permanent Stabilization phase. Permanent weight stabilization is based on three simple safety measures that are easy to follow but which are indispensable if the weight loss is to be maintained: The pure protein phase of the diet must be followed 1 set day per week-for example, every Thursday-for the rest of your life; do not use elevators or escalators; and take 3 tablespoons of oat bran a day. These three rules are non-negotiable, but they are sufficiently specific and effective for you to stick to them over a long period of time.

The Theory Behind the Dukan Diet

Before discussing the diet in detail and explaining exactly how it works and why it is so effective, I want first to give you an outline of the whole four-phase program to make clear from the outset precisely for whom the diet is intended, along with any possible contraindications.

One of the major merits of the Dukan Diet is its educational value. It allows you to learn in real life and with your own body the relative importance of each food group from the order in which they are integrated into the diet. That is, the diet starts with vital foods, then introduces, in succession, indispensable foods, essential foods, and important foods, finishing off with unnecessary but pleasurable foods.

The Dukan Diet provides a system of perfectly interwoven instructions that will clearly and directly set you on the right track, avoiding the need for that never-ending effort of willpower that can slowly undermine your determination.

I will be giving these instructions to you in four successive diet plans. The first two make up the actual weight loss stage, and the second two ensure that the weight loss you achieve is consolidated and then permanently stabilized.

1. The Attack Phase: The Pure Protein Diet

The Attack phase is the conquest phase. Here dieters are always extremely motivated. They are looking for a diet plan that, however arduous it might be, meets their expectations in terms of effectiveness and quick results and that allows them to tackle their weight problem head-on. The length of this phase depends on how much weight one wants to lose. The Attack phase can last as little as 1 day or as many as 10, with most people falling in the 2- to 7-day range.

The diet plan for this initial phase of the Dukan Diet, great for a fast-track approach, limits food to just one of the three food groups- namely, proteins.

Except for egg whites, no food is 100 percent protein. The pure protein diet of the Attack phase selects and groups together foods whose composition is as close as possible to pure protein, such as certain kinds of meat, fish, seafood, poultry, whole eggs, and nonfat dairy products.

Compared with low-calorie diets, the pure protein diet is a real war machine, a bulldozer that, if followed without fail, crushes all resistance. It is effective in the most difficult cases, in particular for premenopausal women suffering from water retention and bloating and for menopausal women. It is just as effective with dieters deemed to be resistant because they have tried and given up on too many diets or aggressive courses of treatment in the past.

2. The Cruise Phase: The Alternating Protein Diet

As its name indicates, this phase works by alternating two diets: the pure protein diet followed by the same diet to which any nonstarchy vegetable, raw or cooked, is added (see ""100 Natural Foods That Keep You Slim,"" page 168). Each alternate cycle works like the injection- combustion cycle of a two-speed engine burning up its calorie quota.

In the alternating cycles of the Cruise phase you can eat the authorized ""as much as you like"" foods at any time of day and in the combination and qua...

Little did he know, that decision would change his and Derek's lives forever.

It turned out there was nothing ""micro"" about Esther, and Steve and Derek had actually signed on to raise a full-sized commercial pig. Within three years, Tiny Esther grew to a whopping 600 pounds. After some real growing pains and a lot of pig-sized messes, it became clear that Esther needed much more space, so Steve and Derek made another life-changing decision: they bought a farm and opened the Happily Ever Esther Farm Sanctuary, where they could care for Esther and other animals in need.

Funny, heartwarming, and utterly charming, ESTHER THE WONDER PIG follows Steve and Derek's adventure--from reluctant pig parents to farm-owning advocates for animals.",114465,"Review

Hopp,",4.4,1015,11.99,12.41,7.99,"A beautiful deluxe trade paperback edition celebrating the 10th anniversary of Barbara Kingsolver's New York Times bestseller, which describes her family's adventure as they move to a farm in southern Appalachia and realign their lives with the local food chain.
Since its publication in 2007, Animal, Vegetable, Miracle has captivated readers with its blend of memoir and journalistic investigation. Newly updated with original pieces from the entire Kingsolver clan, this commemorative volume explores how the family's original project has been carried forward through the years.

When Barbara Kingsolver and her family moved from suburban Arizona to rural Appalachia, they took on a new challenge: to spend a year on a locally-produced diet, paying close attention to the provenance of all they consume. Concerned about the environmental, social, and physical costs of American food culture, they hoped to recover what Barbara considers our nation's lost appreciation for farms and the natural processes of food production. Since 2007, their scheme has evolved enormously. In this new edition, featuring an afterword composed by the entire Kingsolver family, Barbara's husband, Steven, discusses how the project grew into a farm-to-table restaurant and community development project training young farmers in their area to move into sustainable food production. Camille writes about her decision to move back to a rural area after college, and how she and her husband incorporate their food values in their lives as they begin their new family. Lily, Barbara's youngest daughter, writes about how growing up on a farm, in touch with natural processes and food chains, has shaped her life as a future environmental scientist. And Barbara writes about their sheep, and how they grew into her second vocation as a fiber artist, and reports on the enormous response they've received from other home-growers and local-food devotees.

With Americans' ever-growing concern over an agricultural establishment that negatively affects our health and environment, the Kingsolver family's experiences and observations remain just as relevant today as they were ten years ago. Animal, Vegetable, Miracle is a modern classic that will endure for years to come.
“Cogent and illuminating...Without sentimentality, this book captures the pulse of the farm and the deep gratification it provides, as well as the intrinsic humor of the situation.”—Janet Maslin, New York Times

A visionary new master class in cooking that distills decades of professional experience into just four simple elements, from the woman declared “America’s next great cooking teacher” by Alice Waters.

In the tradition of The Joy of Cooking and How to Cook Everything comes Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, an ambitious new approach to cooking by a major new culinary voice. Chef and writer Samin Nosrat has taught everyone from professional chefs to middle school kids to author Michael Pollan to cook using her revolutionary, yet simple, philosophy. Master the use of just four elements—Salt, which enhances flavor; Fat, which delivers flavor and generates texture; Acid, which balances flavor; and Heat, which ultimately determines the texture of food—and anything you cook will be delicious. By explaining the hows and whys of good cooking, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat will teach and inspire a new generation of cooks how to confidently make better decisions in the kitchen and cook delicious meals with any ingredients, anywhere, at any time.

Echoing Samin’s own journey from culinary novice to award-winning chef, Salt, Fat Acid, Heat immediately bridges the gap between home and professional kitchens. With charming narrative, illustrated walkthroughs, and a lighthearted approach to kitchen science, Samin demystifies the four elements of good cooking for everyone. Refer to the canon of 100 essential recipes—and dozens of variations—to put the lessons into practice and make bright, balanced vinaigrettes, perfectly caramelized roast vegetables, tender braised meats, and light, flaky pastry doughs.

Featuring 150 illustrations and infographics that reveal an atlas to the world of flavor by renowned illustrator Wendy MacNaughton, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat will be your compass in the kitchen. Destined to be a classic, it just might be the last cookbook you’ll ever need.

For decades, that question has fascinated a small circle of impassioned doctors and researchers—and now, their life-changing research is making headlines in the hit documentary Forks Over Knives. Their answer? Eat a whole-foods, plant-based diet—it could save your life.

It may overturn most of the diet advice you’ve heard—but the experts behind Forks Over Knives aren’t afraid to make waves. In his book Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn explained that eating meat, dairy, and oils injures the lining of our blood vessels, causing heart disease, heart attack, or stroke. In The China Study, Dr. Colin Campbell revealed how cancer and other diseases skyrocket when eating meat and dairy is the norm—and plummet when a traditional plant-based diet persists. And more and more experts are adding their voices to the cause: There is nothing else you can do for your health that can match the benefits of a plant-based diet.

Now, as Forks Over Knives is introducing more people than ever before to the plant-based way to health, this accessible guide provides the information you need to adopt and maintain a plant-based diet. Features include:
Insights from the luminaries behind the film—Dr. Neal Barnard, Dr. John McDougall, The Engine 2 Diet author Rip Esselstyn, and many others

CHAPTER 1

The Basics Have Changed

In the past few years, much of what we thought we knew about diabetes has been turned on its head. What is now coming into focus is an understanding of its fundamental causes, and that gives us power we never had before.

To make sure we are at the same starting point, let me walk you through the basics: symptoms, diabetes types, and typical treatments as they are currently used. Then I will show you what's new.

HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S DIABETES?

First, let's make sense of the symptoms. Diabetes may arrive with no symptoms at all, but often it starts with fatigue. For no apparent reason, your spark is just no longer there. It may also seem that you are losing water more rapidly than you should be, which is to say that you make trips to the bathroom more often than usual. And you are thirsty: You find yourself drinking a surprising amount of water.

Here is what is going on: The fundamental problem is that sugar is not able to pass from your bloodstream into the cells of your body. From that single problem come a great many others, like one domino knocking over another and another and another.

The sugar we are speaking of is glucose--one of the smallest and simplest sugar molecules. In this case, sugar is not just another word for junk food or empty calories. The fact is that the cells of your body use this kind of sugar--glucose--as an energy source. Like gasoline for your car or jet fuel for an airplane, glucose is your body's fuel. It powers your movements, your thoughts, and more or less everything you do.

And that is exactly the problem. If glucose is unable to enter your cells, they are deprived of their basic fuel, so you lose your energy. That is why you are fatigued. If your muscles do not have the glucose they need for power, you tire easily.

Meanwhile, the glucose that cannot get into your muscle cells builds up in your bloodstream. It becomes more and more concentrated in the blood, and eventually it starts to pass through the kidneys and ends up in your urine.*

Now, as glucose passes through your kidneys, it carries water along with it- -lots of water, hence all those trips to the bathroom. What follows, naturally, is thirst--you are losing all those fluids. So fatigue, frequent urination, and thirst are all symptoms of one problem: glucose having trouble getting into your cells.

You may also find that you are losing weight. And no, this is not an especially welcome event--not in this situation. You lose weight because your cells are in essence starving. Nutrients cannot enter your cells, so your body is malnourished. Yes, even if you are eating plenty of food, nutrients and fuel are unable to get where they are needed.

Every day, people arrive at doctors' offices complaining of fatigue, frequent urination, thirst, and sometimes unexplained weight loss. The doctor takes a blood sample, finds an unusually high level of glucose in the blood, and diagnoses diabetes. The doctor then advises the patient that it is essential to get blood sugar under control. An overly large amount of glucose flooding through the bloodstream day after day can harm the arteries. Left unchecked, it can damage the heart and the delicate blood vessels of the eyes, kidneys, and extremities.

But as we have shown in our research studies, the road to high blood sugar is a two-way street. When you change your diet and make other healthful improvements, a rising glucose level can fall. Sometimes the change can be so dramatic that no doctor looking at you afterward would ever guess that you had once been diagnosed with diabetes.

* The passage of glucose from the bloodstream into the urine led to the technical name doctors use for diabetes: diabetes mellitus. Diabetes comes from a Greek word meaning ""to pass through,"" and mellitus is the Latin word for ""honey"" or ""sweet.""

How Doctors Diagnose Diabetes

Doctors diagnose diabetes if:

. You have symptoms of diabetes (frequent urination, unusual thirst, unexplained weight loss) and your blood glucose level is 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl)--(or 11.1 millimoles per liter (mmol/l)*--or higher, regardless of the time of day or whether you are fasting, or . Your blood glucose level is 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) or higher after an 8-hour fast.

Your doctor will consider this a provisional diagnosis until it is confirmed by similar testing on a separate day. In some cases, doctors perform a glucose tolerance test, in which you drink a syrup containing 75 grams of glucose. If your blood glucose value is 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) or higher 2 hours later, your doctor will diagnose diabetes.

Normal fasting blood glucose is less than 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l). After a 2- hour glucose tolerance test, the value should be less than 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). If your values are above the normal limit but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes, your doctor will diagnose prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance), which often precedes an eventual diabetes diagnosis.

* US medical laboratories measure glucose in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). In most other countries, glucose is measured in millimoles per liter (mmol/l). As you will see, the same units are used in cholesterol measurements.

Diabetes Types

A diagnosis of diabetes--or prediabetes--means the insulin in your body is not doing its job adequately. Insulin is a hormone that moves sugar from your bloodstream into the cells of your body, among other functions. It acts like a key, opening a door to the cell, so to speak, and allowing nutrients inside. When insulin arrives at the cell's surface and opens the door, glucose is able to enter the cell, which uses it for power.

If for some reason your body is not making insulin, the result is rising blood glucose levels. Similarly, your blood glucose rises if your cells resist insulin's actions--the key goes in the lock, but the door will not open. Over the long run, high blood glucose levels can damage your nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other parts of your body.

Diabetes comes in three main types, called type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. Let's look at each one.

Type 1 diabetes usually manifests in childhood or young adulthood. It used to be called childhood-onset or insulin-dependent diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, something has damaged the pancreas's ability to produce insulin, and you need to get it from an outside source--typically by injection. However, recent research has revealed a great deal about how diet changes can dramatically reduce the risk that diabetes will bring any serious complications your way, as you will see in Chapter 3.

In addition, we know more than ever about the causes of the disease, arming us with more power to prevent it. The damage to the insulin-producing cells is caused by the biological equivalent of ""friendly fire."" That is, it is caused by the body's immune system--our white blood cells that are supposed to fight bacteria and viruses. These cells ought to protect you, but instead they have attacked the cells of the pancreas, destroying its ability to produce insulin. In Chapter 3, we will look at what triggers this process. It may surprise you to learn that foods--particularly the foods infants are fed within the first months oflife--are leading suspects.

Type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes, or sometimes non- insulin-dependent diabetes. About 9 out of 10 people with diabetes have type 2. Most people with this form of the disease still produce insulin; the problem is that their cells resist it. Insulin tries to bring glucose into the cells, but the cells respond like a door with a malfunctioning lock. In response to these sluggish cells, your body produces more and more insulin, trying to overcome the resistance. If the body's insulin supply cannot overcome the resistance, glucose simply builds up in your blood.

Diabetes drugs work to counteract this problem: Some make your cells more responsive to insulin. Others cause your pancreas to release more insulin into the bloodstream or block your liver from sending extra glucose into the blood.

Until now, most diabetes diets have tried to compensate for the cells' resistance to insulin's action, too. They limit the amount of sugar in your diet. They also limit starch (complex carbohydrate) because starch is actually made from many glucose molecules joined together in a chain. During digestion, starch breaks down to release natural sugars into the blood. The idea is that if you do not get too much carbohydrate at any one time, your cells will not be overwhelmed with too much glucose. For people on medications, typical diet plans aim to keep the amount of glucose or starch fairly constant from meal to meal and from day to day so the amount of medication required to help your body process glucose--your daily dosage- -can stay the same, too. In short, these diets guide you on what, when, and how much to eat.

Insulin is Made in the Pancreas

Insulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located just behind your stomach that is about the size and shape of a TV remote control. In fact, remote control is what the pancreas is all about. It sends insulin into the bloodstream to travel to the cells of your body to help them take in glucose from the bloodstream. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas has stopped making insulin. In type 2 and gestational diabetes, the pancreas is usually able to make insulin, but the body's cells resist its action.

New research has changed everything, however. We can now use diet changes to influence insulin sensitivity directly. So, as you will see shortly, the nutrition prescription has been completely rewritten to take advantage of this new understanding.

Gestational diabetes is similar to type 2 except that it occurs during pregnancy. While it typically disappears after childbirth, it is a sign of insulin resistance, and that means that type 2 diabetes may be around the corner. With the same sorts of steps that tackle type 2 diabetes, we can often stop gestational diabetes from ever turning into type 2.

GENES ARE NOT DESTINY

Diabetes runs in families, but don't take that to mean that if one of your parents has diabetes, a similar diagnosis has to be your fate as well. You can change things.

Let's take a look at type 1 diabetes first. Many children are born with genes that make it possible for them to develop type 1 diabetes, but most of them never do. In fact, even among identical twins, when one twin has type 1 diabetes, the other has less than a 40 percent chance of having it.1 What makes the difference, apparently, is the environment, particularly the foods the child is exposed to early in life, viral infections, and perhaps other factors.

Genes play a similar role in type 2 diabetes. Many years before diabetes ever manifests, special tests can detect insulin resistance in young adults who have inherited a tendency toward type 2 diabetes from their parents. If they eat the same kinds of foods their parents did, they are very likely headed for a diagnosis. Abundant evidence shows, however, that changes in diet and lifestyle can cut the odds that diabetes will occur. When it does occur, diet can dramatically alter its course.

The point is this: Some genes are dictators, and others are not. The genes for hair color or eye color, for example, really are dictators. If they call for you to have brown hair or blue eyes, you can't argue. But the genes for diabetes are more like committees. They do not give orders; they make suggestions.

If our genes call for diabetes, we do not necessarily have to listen to them. We have more control than you might imagine.

HEMOGLOBIN A1C

As you have seen, doctors diagnose diabetes based on your blood glucose level, and tracking your blood glucose is an important way to track the effects of diet and medication dosages. As helpful as glucose testing is, though, it really indicates only how you are doing at the time you take the test. The best way to tell how you are doing over the long run is with a test called hemoglobin A1c, or A1c for short. This is the main way you will track your progress in controlling diabetes.

Hemoglobin is the pigment that gives color to your red blood cells and whose job it is to carry oxygen. What the A1c test actually measures is how much glucose has entered your red blood cells and become stuck to hemoglobin. If you have had a lot of glucose in your blood, a fair amount of it gets into your cells and sticks to your hemoglobin. If you have not had much glucose in your blood, your hemoglobin has much less stuck to it.

Since red blood cells have a fairly short life span (about 4 months), the test indicates how well your blood sugar has been controlled over the preceding 3 months or so. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that people with diabetes get their A1c values below 7 percent. Research shows, however, that lower values cut the risk of complications, so many experts now call for targets of 6.5 or even 6 percent.

DIABETES DIETS

If you have diabetes, chances are you were given printed guidelines on what to eat and what to avoid. Perhaps you have met with a dietitian, and you may have been referred to a diabetes class. Unfortunately, most people do not get the ongoing support they need to make dietary changes, and as a result, this well-meaning effort may not have much effect. If you are like many people, you may have found your diet tough to sustain.

For many years, the ADA has offered diet recommendations designed to provide basic nutrition while also keeping calorie intake and food choices reasonably stable over the course of the day and from one day to the next, as you saw above. The idea was that if you had no carbohydrates for breakfast but then had a big carb-fest later in the day, your blood sugar would change erratically. Similarly, if you had lots of starchy foods on Monday but went low-carb the rest of the week, your blood sugar would be all over the map, and your medications could not keep up with you.

Lustig,4.6,966,8.99,11.92,13.42,"The landmark New York Times best seller that reveals how the explosion of sugar in our diets has created an obesity epidemic, and what we can do to save ourselves.

Robert Lustig is at the forefront of war against sugar — showing us that it's toxic, it's addictive, and it's everywhere because the food companies want it to be. His 90-minute YouTube video ""Sugar: The Bitter Truth"" has been viewed more than 7 million times. Now, in this landmark book, he documents the science and the politics that have led to personal misery and public crisis — the pandemic of obesity and chronic disease--over the last thirty years.
 
In the late 1970s, when the U.S. government declared that we needed to get the fat out of our diets, the food industry responded by pumping in more sugar to make food more palatable (and more salable), and by removing the fiber to make food last longer on the shelf. The result has been a perfect storm for our health, disastrously altering our biochemistry to make us think we're starving, drive our eating habits out of our control, and turn us into couch potatoes. If we cannot control how we eat, it's because of the catastrophic excess of sugar in our diet--the resulting hormonal imbalances have rewired our brains!
 
To help us lose weight and recover our health, Lustig presents strategies we can each use to readjust the key hormones that regulate hunger, reward, and stress, as well as societal strategies to improve the health of the next generation. With scientific rigor and even a little humor, Fat Chance categorically proves that ""a calorie is not a calorie,"" and takes that knowledge to its logical conclusion--an overhaul of the global food system.",24594,"Review
“No scientist has done more in the last fifty years to alert Americans to the potential dangers of sugar in the diet than Dr. Robert Lustig.” 
--Gary Taubes, author of Good Calories, Bad Calories and Why We Get Fat
 
“Our eating habits are killing us. In this timely and important book, Dr. Robert Lustig presents the scientific evidence for the toxicity of sugar and the disastrous effects of modern industrial food on the hormones that control hunger, satiety, and weight. He gives recommendations for a personal solution to the problem we face and also suggests a public policy solution. Fat Chance is the best book I've read on the relationship between diet and health and the clearest explanation of epidemic obesity in our society.”
--Andrew Weil, M.D., author of Spontaneous Happiness and You Can’t Afford to Get Sick
 
“Fat Chance is THE manifesto for our time. It reveals the real reasons we why we are a fat nation and how to cure the obesity epidemic.  It gets right to the root of the problem, which is not gluttony and sloth, as the food industry, government and your neighbor would have you believe.  It is because we are drowning in a sea of sugar which poisons our metabolism, shrinks our brains, and threatens our national security and global competitiveness.  Every American, politician, teacher, and business leader must read this book.  Our nation's future depends on it.” 
 --Mark Hyman, M.D., author of The Blood Sugar Solution
 
“Fat Chance is an extraordinary achievement. Obesity's causes, mechanisms, health consequences, and preventive approaches are all devilishly complicated, but Dr. Lustig's outstanding contribution clarifies the complexity via a writing style that's accessible, insightful, and often gently humorous. Robert Lustig is a clinician, a scientist, and an advocate — a combination that that makes him uniquely qualified to bring the condition's many facets into sharp focus. Obesity has become the world's number one health problem. Fat Chance is the book for all of us who must confront this epidemic.”
--., Departments of Radiology and Anthropology, Emory University, and father of the Paleo Diet movement
 
“Robert Lustig is neither ringing an alarm bell nor giving us a gentle, paternalistic nudge. His message is more authentic. He is a medical doctor issuing a prescription. In order to address a current cocktail of health threats, Americans must alter their diets and do so radically. Those alterations must begin with a dramatic reduction in the consumption of sugars.”

“The obesity pandemic is well documented. But what can be done about it? More importantly, when does a personal health issue rise to become a public health crisis? In , Dr. Robert Lustig examines the science of obesity to determine the role that our current diet (especially too much sugar and too little fiber) plays in weight gain and disease. Using that knowledge, he proposes changes in our personal, public, and governmental attitudes to combat this scourge. is a 'savory' read with a 'sweet' finish.”

Introduction

I cook because I love to eat. I’m not talking about just good-for-you foods like salads and quinoa—although, yes, those are great. The foods I crave range from classic comfort dishes to global cuisine, and everything in between. At the same time, I try to eat a light and balanced diet, and these two things don’t necessarily go together. That’s what led me to start experimenting in my own kitchen eight years ago. I wanted to find ways to eat the foods I craved, but without throwing off all of my hard work to lose weight and keep it off. Plus, as a mom, I had to find a way to please not only my palate, but my picky family’s preferences as well, because cooking separate meals is just not an option for me. The results of those experiments ultimately became my blog Skinnytaste.com, and later inspired my first cookbook, The Skinnytaste Cookbook.

My mission with my first cookbook was to help people create low-calorie food without sacrificing flavor. I also wanted to help take away some of the fear and intimidation that people—especially beginners—feel about cooking. I was thrilled that the book was received so well—thanks to loyal Skinnytaste fans and so many others, it was a bestseller. What a dream come true! But, as I talked with people about the book, I kept fielding similar questions: “Are the recipes easy?” and “Are the recipes fast? I don’t have time to cook.” At the same time, I was receiving emails and Facebook requests for more superquick weeknight ideas, as well as recipes for the slow cooker. With all of this feedback, I knew exactly what my next book should be about.

Skinnytaste Fast and Slow is filled with two types of recipes: quick and easy dishes that are ready in 30 minutes or less, and those that are made in a slow cooker. With this book, no matter how busy you are, you can enjoy a delicious home-cooked meal. Tasty, light, and time-saving! I want everything in these pages to help simplify your life, because I totally get it—I understand the stress of having to come up with healthy meals the whole family will enjoy on a limited time schedule. Talk about pressure!
 
TAKE A TASTE
In this book, you’ll find 140 recipes that are light on calories and packed with nutrients and satisfying flavors, while being simple enough to make anytime. Many of these dishes are versions of the comfort foods I loved during my childhood, and others are my current favorites. All of them have been simplified and skinny-fied, so they slim your waistline fit into your busy schedule. I’ve spent a year testing and tweaking everything here, and I learned a lot along the way (you’d be amazed what you can make in a slow cooker . . . hello, brownies [see page 296]!). I hope that as you flip through this book, you’ll discover that you can enjoy great taste and good health, even when time is tight.



Serves 6

All the flavors you love from Buffalo wings, without all those darn calories—it’s time to get your fingers dirty! I love making shredded Buffalo chicken in the slow cooker because it’s super easy and so versatile. I use leftovers on sandwiches, over salads, as tacos, and in just about anything I can think up.

CHICKEN
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 medium celery stalk
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1 garlic clove
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth*
1/2 cup cayenne pepper sauce (I like Frank’s RedHot Original), plus more for serving
 
BLUE CHEESE DRESSING
6 tablespoons low-fat buttermilk
1⁄4 cup light mayonnaise
5 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese
2 tablespoons chopped scallion, white parts only
1⁄8 teaspoon garlic powder
1⁄8 teaspoon onion powder
 
1⁄8 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1⁄8 teaspoon kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
12 outer lettuce leaves, such as green leaf, red leaf, or iceberg
3⁄4 cup shredded carrots



1. For the chicken: In a slow cooker, arrange the chicken, celery, onion, and garlic. Pour in enough broth to cover the chicken (add water if the broth isn’t enough).

2. Cover and cook on high for 2 hours or on low for 4 hours, until the chicken is cooked through.

3. Remove the chicken from the slow cooker and discard the liquid and vegetables. Shred the chicken with 2 forks and return it to the slow cooker. Add the hot sauce and cook on high for 30 minutes.

4. For the blue cheese dressing: In a blender, combine the buttermilk, mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons of the blue cheese, the scallion whites, garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, salt, and pepper to taste. Blend until smooth. Stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons blue cheese.

5. To serve, put 2 lettuce leaves on each of 6 plates. Place a generous 1⁄4 cup chicken on each leaf, top each with 1 tablespoon shredded carrots, 1 tablespoon celery, and 1 tablespoon of the dressing.

From Booklist
How many magazine, newspaper, and book recipes have resulted in major dining disasters, or at least less-than-optimum visual and tasty delights? Not content to rely on titles alone, nationally known cook and TV host Garten, aka the Barefoot Contessa, carefully counsels reader-chefs on turning out perfect dishes and menus every time. Each page, if not featuring a list of foolproof techniques and tips, includes all the right directions as well as photographs. Just a sampling of the ideas that make her 100 dishes work: freeze cookie dough but not already baked cookies; when a dish specifies fleur de sel, don’t use kosher salt; avoid serving appetizers on Thanksgiving, but do cook in abundance, so that guests go home with leftovers. Her treats, as always (and like her packaged mixes), are stomach pleasers: mustard and gruyère batons, lobster mac and cheese, salted caramel brownies, and cinnamon baked donuts, among others. --Barbara Jacobs

Just a few years after I was married, I was given a small Brinkmann smoker-the one that looks like R2-D2-and I set out to learn how to use it. I was determined to make the most of that smoker no matter how many folks told me that it was cheap and hard to use. This sparked in me a love for the taste of smoked meats and a passion for the tools and techniques you need to produce them . . . I will equip you with the basic knowledge you need to produce succulent slow smoked food right in your very own backyard- food that will make you a legend in your neighbourhood and maybe even your town.","['great book', 'highly recommend', 'easy to follow', 'jeff phillips', 'great recipes', 'new to smoking', 'rub and sauce', 'electric smoker', 'recommend this book', 'excellent book', 'step by step', 'bbq sauce', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Sure, there are ten new features in this all-new, updated book. Sure, it's even simpler than it was before. Of course, you don't have to worry about fertilizer or poor soil ever again because you'll be growing above the ground.
But, the best feature is that ""anyone,"" ""anywhere"" can enjoy a Square Foot garden. Children, adults with limited mobility, even complete novices can achieve spectacular results.
But, let's get back to the ten improvements. You're going to love them.
1) New Location - Move your garden closer to your house by eliminating single-row gardening. Square Foot Garden needs just ""twenty percent"" of the space of a traditional garden.
2) New Direction - Locate your garden ""on top"" of existing soil. Forget about pH soil tests, double-digging (who enjoys that?), or the never-ending soil improvements.
3) New Soil - The new ""Mel's Mix"" is the perfect growing mix. Why, we even give you the recipe. Best of all, you can even ""buy"" the different types of compost needed.
4) New Depth - You only need to prepare a SFG box to a depth of 6 inches! It's true--the majority of plants develop just fine when grown at this depth.
5) No Fertilizer - The all new SFG does not need any fertilizer-ever! If you start with the perfect soil mix, then you don't need to add fertilizer.
6) New Boxes - The new method uses bottomless boxes placed aboveground. We show you how to build your own (with step-by-step photos).
7) New Aisles - The ideal gardening aisle width is about three to four feet. That makes it even easier to kneel, work, and harvest.
8) New Grids - Prominent and permanent grids added to your SFG box help you visualize the planting squares and know how to space for maximum harvest.
9) New Seed Saving Idea - The old-fashioned way advocates planting many seeds and then thinning the extras (that means pulling them up). The new method means planting a pinch- literally two or three seeds--per planting hole.
10) Tabletop Gardens - The new boxes are so much smaller and lighter (only 6 inches of soil, remember?), you can add a plywood bottom to make them portable.
Of course, that's not all. We've also included simple, easy-to-follow instructions using lots of photos and illustrations. You're going to love it!",387774,"Review
""Bartholomew, author of the popular Square Foot Gardening (1981), has refined his original square-foot gardening concept by adding ten improvements, including a new location for the garden that is closer to the house, a special soil mix, and six-inch deep, 4' x 4' above-ground boxes with grids. His techniques do not require heavy digging or fertilizers and feature advice on using vertical gardening to save space. He clearly explains the square-foot concept, from the rationale behind it (the square-foot garden takes up much less space than traditional row gardening and saves time, money, and aggravation) to how to plan the garden, build the boxes and vertical supports, and employ his planting and cultural techniques. There are also helpful charts for succession planting and spacing plants and a schedule for starting seeds indoors. Despite its somewhat annoying tendency to read like an infomercial, this attractive, easy-to-understand, and well-organized book for both novice and experienced gardeners is recommended for all libraries."" — Library Journal

This is the definitive guide to the concepts, methods, equipment, and accessories of barbecue and grilling. The founder and editor of the world's most popular BBQ and grilling website, AmazingRibs.com, Meathead applies the latest research to backyard cooking more than 100 thoroughly tested recipes.
 
With the help of physicist and food scientist Prof. Greg Blonder, PhD, of Boston University, he explains why dry brining is better than wet brining; how marinades really work; why rubs shouldn't have salt in them; the importance of digital thermometers; why searing doesn't seal in juices; how salt penetrates but spices don't; when charcoal beats gas and when gas beats charcoal; how to calibrate and tune a grill or smoker; how to keep fish from sticking; cooking with logs; the strengths and weaknesses of the new pellet cookers; tricks for rotisserie cooking; why cooking whole animals is a bad idea; which grill grates are best; and why beer-can chicken is a waste of good beer and nowhere close to the best way to cook a bird.
 
He shatters the myths that stand in the way of perfection. Among the many busted old husband's tales:
 
* Myth: Bring meat to room temperature before cooking.
* Myth: Soak wood before using it.
* Myth: Bone-in steaks taste better.
* Myth: You should sear first, then cook.

""Readers will be delighted to learn that a man who willingly calls himself Meathead can still be trusted with a collection that has science in the subtitle. Goldwyn, whose day job is running the website amazingribs.com, explores the complexity of heat, meat, and smoke in the first half of his book, with a sense of humor sharper than his nickname suggests and a stack of scientific research provided by physicist Greg Blonder. Then he offers more than 100 recipes to take to the grill...[an] excellent guidebook.""
--Publishers Weeklky

“This is the book barbecue nerds have been waiting for. Myth and lore abounds in the world of cooking, and nowhere more so than in the primal arena that exists when humans put open fire and meat together in the great outdoors (or suburban backyard, as the case may be). That’s good news for anyone who, like me, longs to understand the science of grilling and barbecue; the thermodynamics of heat transfer under that kettle dome, the chemistry of the smoke ring, and what makes a char-grilled steak so g*&@%# delicious.
            Meathead's gift lies not just in factual accuracy, but also in being able to distill complex subjects to their most essential, applicable core in a manner that is a genuine pleasure to read. You'll laugh out loud at his metaphors. A good technical writer will leave you feeling like you know more than when you started. A great one can leave you feeling like more than a passive bystander. It'll make you feel like an active participant, like you've been on a voyage of discovery for yourself. Flipping over each page to discover what lies on the next will remind you of the very first time you peeked under the cover of your grill and breathed in the alchemy that occurs between smoke and meat. You'll see conventions challenged, techniques elucidated, and myths busted, and you'll have a wildly fun time in the process.
With hundreds of pages on techniques, theory, equipment, and background science before you even get to the recipes, this is a book that is squarely aimed at cooks who don’t just want a single good rack of ribs coming off their grill, but who want to understand what makes them good and how to repeat it time after time. Soak in enough of the background technique and you won't even need a recipe. You have all the tools you need to develop your own. I love to grill but I'm not barbecue guru. After reading , I'm gonna be pretty darned good at faking it though.”

Smith, founder of MissVickie.com, a highly trafficked Web site devoted to all things steam-pressured, compiles her expertise in a single tome, covering the history of pressure cookery from its inception in the 17th century to its resurgence today. Smith extols pressure cooking's benefits, including fuel efficiency, faster cooking time, reduced fats, higher levels of nutrient retention and the ability to create lower-cost one-pot meals. Several pages are devoted to exact cooking times for specific vegetables, meats, fish, beans and even pasta shapes. Though there are a fair number of recipes featuring legumes, for example, this cookbook is mainly geared to a meat-eating audience. As might be expected, a good deal are stewlike creations, but Smith covers eclectic ground with dishes like Italian Seasoned Veal Tortellini Stew; Walnut Chicken Braised in Pomegranate Juice; and Mexican Posole (pork stew with green chile and hominy). Outside of the one-pot meals are ragus, pilafs and pulled meats for sandwich stuffing. Smith even rounds up some intriguing desserts like Sweet Dumpling Flan with Caramel Sauce and a basic bread pudding with six variations. Eminently thorough and enlightening, Smith's cookbook is bound to please the beginner pressure cooker and aficionado alike. (Mar.)

Never one to be content with yesterday’s baking triumph, however, Peter continues to refine his recipes and techniques in his never-ending quest for extraordinary bread.

In The Bread Baker’s Apprentice, Peter shares his latest bread breakthroughs, arising from his study in several of France’s famed boulangeries and the always-enlightening time spent in the culinary academy kitchen with his students. Peer over Peter’s shoulder as he learns from Paris’s most esteemed bakers, like Lionel Poilâne and Phillippe Gosselin, whose pain à l’ancienne has revolutionized the art of baguette making. Then stand alongside his students in the kitchen as Peter teaches the classic twelve stages of building bread, his clear instructions accompanied by over 100 step-by-step photographs.

You’ll put newfound knowledge into practice with 50 new master formulas for such classic breads as rustic ciabatta, hearty pain de campagne, old-school New York bagels, and the book’s Holy Grail–Peter’s version of the famed pain à l’ancienne. En route, Peter distills hard science, advanced techniques, and food history into a remarkably accessible and engaging resource that is as rich and multitextured as
the loaves you’ll turn out. This is original food writing at its most captivating, teaching at its most inspired and inspiring–and the rewards are some of the best breads under the sun.

""A bread baker, like any true artisan or craftsman, must have the power to control outcomes,"" says Peter Reinhart, author of The Bread Baker's Apprentice. ""Mastery comes with practice."" As in many arts, you must know and understand the rules before you can break them. Reinhart encourages you to learn the science of bread making, but to never forget that vision and experimentation, not formulas, make transcendent loaves. The Bread Baker's Apprentice is broken into three sections. The first is an amusing tale of Reinhart's visit to France and his discovery of pain à l'ancienne, a cold-fermented baguette. The second section comprises a tutorial of bread-making basics and Reinhart's ""Twelve Stages of Bread."" And finally, the recipes: Ciabatta, Pane Siciliano, Potato Rosemary Bread, New York Deli Rye, Kaiser Rolls, and Brioche, to name a few. All recipes include bread profiles and ingredient percentages. Reimagined for modern bakers, these mouthwatering classic recipes are bound to inspire. --Dana Van Nest

From Library Journal
Author of the well-respected Brother Juniper's Bread Book and Crust & Crumb, baker-turned-culinary instructor Reinhart draws on his baking and teaching experience to provide an authoritative but unintimidating guide to baking professional-quality loaves of all sorts. He begins with an account of a recent tour of specialty bakeries in Paris, including Gosselin, where he learned to make the young baker's unique pain l'ancienne which, Reinhart says, would be better called pain moderne, as it uses a modern invention (the refrigerator) to produce a ""cold-dough delayed-fermentation"" baguette, the best he has ever tasted. He found this technique revolutionary, and he includes the recipe here, along with a wide variety of other artisan and classic breads, from Ciabatta to Poilene-Style Miche to Tuscan Bread. The recipes are preceded by a 50-page primer on the ""twelve stages of bread,"" and there are dozens of photographs, including particularly helpful ones of shaping different loaves. Valuable for both the professional and the novice, this is highly recommended for all baking collections.

Bestselling author Jonathan Safran Foer spent much of his life oscillating between enthusiastic carnivore and occasional vegetarian. For years he was content to live with uncertainty about his own dietary choices-but once he started a family, the moral dimensions of food became increasingly important.

Faced with the prospect of being unable to explain why we eat some animals and not others, Foer set out to explore the origins of many eating traditions and the fictions involved with creating them. Traveling to the darkest corners of our dining habits, Foer raises the unspoken question behind every fish we eat, every chicken we fry, and every burger we grill.

A must-read for anyone who cares about building a more humane and healthy world, Eating Animals is a book that, in the words of the Los Angeles Times, places Jonathan Safran Foer ""at the table with our greatest philosophers.""",12828,"Review
""Stirring...compelling, earnest....Foer brings an invigorating moral clarity to the topic.""―Entertainment Weekly

""Eating Animals isn't just an anti-meat screed, or an impassioned case for vegetarianism. Instead, Foer tells a story that is part memoir and part investigative report....It's a book that takes America's meat-dominated diet to task.""―NPR, All Things Considered

""Eating Animals carefully, deliberately, takes you through every relevant dimension of factory farming....One sees it from the inside, the outside, the moral high ground, the dithering consumer level, through Foer's family stories, from slaughterhouse workers, animal behaviorists, even from defenders of the system....Foer's aim is not to make your choice, but to inform it. He has done us all a great service, and we, and the animals, owe him our thanks.""―Andrew Weil, MD

""Foer's case for ethical vegetarianism is wholly compelling....A blend of solid--and discomforting--reportage with fierce advocacy that will make committed carnivores squeal.""―Kirkus Reviews

""A work of moral philosophy....The fact that Foer makes me wonder whether I'm being, at best, a hypocrite every time I eat a piece of beef suggests he's completely successful in at least one ambition."" ―Geoff Nicholson, San Francisco Chronicle

""Extraordinarily thoughtful and intelligent."" ―Holly Silva, St. Louis Post-Dispatch

""Foer's book raises critical ethical questions we all need to face....We shouldn't be polluting the planet to satisfy our appetites.""―Huffington Post

"" stands as a pop-cultural landmark, destined to be the starting point for a lot of overdue conversations."" ―

""For a hot young writer to train his sights on a subject as unpalatable as meat production and consumption takes raw nerve. What makes so unusual is vegetarian Foer's empathy for human meat eaters, his willingness to let both factory farmers and food reform activists speak for themselves, and his talent for using humor to sweeten a sour argument.""―

WINNER OF AN ASTONISHING FOUR IACP AWARDS, INCLUDING COOKBOOK OF THE YEAR AND THE JULIA CHILD FIRST BOOK AWARD

Vivian Howard, star of PBS's A CHEF'S LIFE, celebrates the flavors of North Carolina's coastal plain in more than 200 recipes and stories.

This new classic of American country cooking proves that the food of Deep Run, North Carolina--Vivian's home--is as rich as any culinary tradition in the world.

Organized by ingredient with dishes suited to every skill level--from beginners to confident cooks--DEEP RUN ROOTS features time-honored simple preparations alongside extraordinary meals from her acclaimed restaurant Chef and the Farmer. Home cooks will find photographs for every single recipe.

As much a storybook as it is a cookbook, DEEP RUN ROOTS imparts the true tale of Southern food: rooted in family and tradition, yet calling out to the rest of the world.

Ten years ago, Vivian opened Chef and the Farmer and put the nearby town of Kinston on the culinary map. But in a town paralyzed by recession, she couldn't hop on every new culinary trend. Instead, she focused on rural development: If you grew it, she'd buy it. Inundated by local sweet potatoes, blueberries, shrimp, pork, and beans, Vivian learned to cook the way generations of Southerners before her had, relying on resourcefulness, creativity, and the traditional ways of preserving food.

DEEP RUN ROOTS is the result of years of effort to discover the riches of Eastern North Carolina. Like The Fannie Farmer Cookbook, The Art of Simple Food, and The Taste of Country Cooking before it, this is landmark work of American food writing.

Recipes include:
Family favorites like Blueberry BBQ Chicken, Creamed Collard-Stuffed Potatoes, Fried Yams with Five-Spice Maple Bacon Candy, Chicken and Rice, and Country-Style Pork Ribs in Red Curry-Braised Watermelon,
Crowd-pleasers like Butterbean Hummus, Tempura-Fried Okra with Ranch Ice Cream, Pimiento Cheese Grits with Salsa and Pork Rinds, Cool Cucumber Crab Dip, and Oyster Pie,
Show-stopping desserts like Warm Banana Pudding, Peaches and Cream Cake, Spreadable Cheesecake, and Pecan-Chewy Pie,
And 200 more quick breakfasts, weeknight dinners, holiday centerpieces, seasonal preserves, and traditional preparations for all kinds of cooks.

Now the founder of heathygreendrink.com offers a persuasive argument for adding a green drink to your day, as well as recipes for dozens of different variations.
Why drink green?
Green leafy vegetables are extremely alkaline and great for lowering your blood pH and remedying many common ailments and diseases.
By juicing or blending the vegetables into a delicious smoothie, you can enjoy the goodness of many more cups of greens that you could possibly eat in one sitting.
The juicing process also breaks down or removes the fibers of the plants so their nutrients are able to get into your system quicker.
The “green drink” approach offers dieters the chance to add something rather than take it away, without guilt.

A cleansing detox drink is a fantastic, tasty way to consume all your necessary vitamins and minerals without having to resort to a processed multivitamin. Plus, green-drinkers quickly start to crave more fruits and vegetables, leading them to a healthier diet over all.

Let's face it. Anyone can copy and paste chicken recipes from the internet, but you and your family and friends deserve to eat food worth the time and effort you put into it. Cooking cock is tougher than you might think. Unlike everyday chicken (which is usually a hen), it can be tough, stringy and dry. Learn to slay this beast from someone who has trained at the breast of some of Europe's sauciest moms and grandmas.

You'll be sure to put a smile on everyone's face with these lip-smacking recipes!

Once revered for his virility and strength, the rooster has taken a back seat to the hen in more recent years. With healthy chicken recipes like Risotto Cock Balls and Cock-o's, 50 Ways to Eat Cock is a fun and inventive chicken cookbook that takes a revealing look at the folklore, history, culinary culture and nutritional benefits of this well-endowed ingredient. With tongue-in-cheek descriptions, these playful cock recipes are bulging with everything from the quintessential to the quick-and-easy to the downright quirky. You’ll learn how to tame this tough bird meat into succulent and finger-licking gourmet meals. Finally, the noble cock retakes his rightful place at the head of the table.

Grab the hard copy as the perfect Christmas, birthday, Mother's/Father's Day, Valentine's Day and bridal shower gift!* If you want, you can also make any of these recipes with regular ol' chicken, but they wouldn't be nearly as fun.",1590,"Review

|About the author
Adrienne Hew has been called “the Nutrition Heretic” and “the Pope of Health” because she challenges the sacred cows of cult-like diets. Her unique insight has both Dietetic Associations and politically correct, so-called alternative health advocates scrambling to justify their broken theories about health that have contributed to the current outbreak of new and seemingly irreparable diseases. Ms. Hew began her holistic health journey after suffering innumerable health problems while following the American Dietetics Association’s dietary recommendations. Her brush with death, after being treated by a now very popular vegan doctor, set her on a quest to learn the dietary commonalities amongst all healthy societies. Using her fluency in three languages, she has been able to uncover many long forgotten food traditions throughout the world. Receiving a certificate in Chinese dietetics in 2002 and her degree as a Certified Nutritionist in 2004, she has helped many clients and workshop attendees to decode their own health dilemmas by understanding the inconsistencies in conventional nutritional dogma. As a cook, her recipes have been popular with everyone from celebrated chefs to picky 4 year olds and adults who “don’t eat that”. She currently resides in Hawaii with her husband and two children. She can be found online at http://www.nutritionheretic.com as well as on her Facebook fan page (http://www.facebook.com/TheNutritionHeretic) and on Twitter (http://twitter.com/NutriHeretic).",,"['white elephant', 'gag gift', 'elephant gift', 'eat cock', 'bridal shower', 'good recipes', 'ways to eat', 'sense of humor', 'gift exchange', 'great gag', 'bought this for a white', 'good laugh', 'dirty santa', 'cookbook', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Most Americans live a “germ-free” lifestyle, sanitizing and scrubbing every surface, eating processed and pasteurized food, and slathering on anti-bacterial gels. But while our homes and hands may be clean, our health is taking a hit. Starved of actual nutrition and overtaxed by chemicals, stress, and excessive antimicrobial use, we are developing microscopic tears in our intestinal walls.
These tears can lead to a condition known as “leaky gut syndrome,” a deterioration of the gut wall that results in wide-spread inflammation and weakened immunity. In his bestselling book Eat Dirt, functional medicine practitioner Dr. Josh Axe explains the hidden causes and widespread effects of leaky gut syndrome and offers a program to heal the gut and restore health in five easy steps.
Dr Axe offers diagnostic quizzes to help readers assess their gut type, then provides simple regimes designed to heal the gut and eliminate digestive and autoimmune problems. From reducing antibiotic use to eating seasonally, spending more time outdoors, managing stress, and incorporating probiotic-rich foods into your diet, Dr. Axe’s program can help anyone restore gut health and feel their best.

“Eat Dirt is a proven way to address the root cause of all disease. The first step to healing yourself is healing your gut. If you’re ready to learn some cutting edge concepts and take back your health, this book is for you.” (Mark Hyman, MD, author of The Blood Sugar Solution)

“If you’re struggling with a chronic illness like digestive problems, autoimmune disease or adrenal and thyroid conditions, this book can change your life. Dr. Axe lays out an easy-to-follow plan for addressing the root cause of disease where it starts in the gut. ” (Sara Gottfried MD, author of The Hormone Reset Diet and The Hormone Cure)

“There is a beautiful course correction afoot… In Eat Dirt, Dr. Axe deconstructs the myth behind our war against germs, sheds light on why and how we are sick, and honors the ancient wisdom of healing that starts with the gut.” (Kelly Brogan, MD ABIHM, author of A Mind of Your Own)

“Dr. Axe combines cutting-edge science and the ancient practice of natural immunization into a 5-step plan that taps the body’s innate defenses to reduce inflammation and chronic pain, lose weight, and increase energy and vitality. You’ll love this fun, counterintuitive strategy to achieve optimal health: Get dirty!” (JJ Virgin, author of The Sugar Impact Diet)

“Our understanding of what really threatens human health is undergoing a revolution, and Eat Dirt magnificently describes this paradigm shift. Dr. Axe’s guidance, centered on reestablishing healthy gut bacteria, is in line with our most respected and forward-thinking medical research. Read this book and open doors to lifelong health.” (David Perlmutter, MD, author, #1 New York Times Bestseller, Grain Brain )
From the Back Cover
In recent decades, modern “improvements” to our lifestyle and food supply have come with a cost: our health. From pesticides in our soil to the refrigeration and pasteurization of our food to an overreliance on antibiotics and a preoccupation with sanitizing everything in sight, our desire to be clean is actually putting us at risk for a host of chronic illnesses.
That’s because as we’ve shifted our focus to living a germ-free life, our bodies—specifically, our digestive systems—have taken a hit. Starved of actual nutrition, fed toxic levels of processed foods, and overtaxed by chemicals, stress, and excessive antimicrobial use, we’ve developed microscopic tears in our intestinal walls, leading to the widespread inflammation and weakened immunity that characterize a condition known as “leaky gut syndrome.”
In Eat Dirt, functional medicine practitioner Dr. Josh Axe explains the hidden causes and widespread effects of leaky gut syndrome, a condition that is thought to be ground zero for many of the country’s most confounding health crises—including allergies, asthma, food sensitivities, diabetes, digestive diseases, arthritis, thyroid conditions, and even frustratingly difficult-to-treat conditions such as chronic fatigue and autism.
Dr. Axe explains that 70 percent of our immune system is located in the gut—when it’s under attack, our health suffers. In leaky gut syndrome, a number of factors—including insufficient exposure to“dirt”—leads to the breakdown of the intestinal wall, allowing food, bacteria, and toxins to seep into the bloodstream. In Eat Dirt, Dr. Axe reveals that the solution, while counterintuitive, is almost effortless: we just need to welcome a little more “dirt” back into our lives.
From ditching hand sanitizers, using essential oils for personal products, reducing antibiotic use, and consuming local honey to spending more time outside, eating seasonally, managing stress, and incorporating probiotic-rich foods into our diets, Dr. Axe provides specific guidance to help everyone get a little “dirty.”

Cooking in her tiny Manhattan kitchen was, at least at first, for special occasions—and, too often, an unnecessarily daunting venture. Deb found herself overwhelmed by the number of recipes available to her. Have you ever searched for the perfect birthday cake on Google? You’ll get more than three million results. Where do you start? What if you pick a recipe that’s downright bad?
 
With the same warmth, candor, and can-do spirit her award-winning blog, Smitten Kitchen, is known for, here Deb presents more than 100 recipes—almost entirely new, plus a few favorites from the site—that guarantee delicious results every time.
 
Gorgeously illustrated with hundreds of her beautiful color photographs, The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook is all about approachable, uncompromised home cooking. Here you’ll find better uses for your favorite vegetables: asparagus blanketing a pizza; ratatouille dressing up a sandwich; cauliflower masquerading as pesto. These are recipes you’ll bookmark and use so often they become your own, recipes you’ll slip to a friend who wants to impress her new in-laws, and recipes with simple ingredients that yield amazing results in a minimum amount of time.

Deb tells you her favorite summer cocktail; how to lose your fear of cooking for a crowd; and the essential items you need for your own kitchen. From salads and slaws that make perfect side dishes (or a full meal) to savory tarts and galettes; from Mushroom Bourguignon to Chocolate Hazelnut Crepe Cake, Deb knows just the thing for a Tuesday night, or your most special occasion.",8121,"Amazon.com Review

Q. What's your elevator pitch for The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook? (Or what inspired you to fill this niche?)
A. My hope is that The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook is filled with your new favorite things to cook--approachable recipes made with accessible ingredients that exceed your expectations.
Q. Which upcoming fall cookbooks are you most excited about?
A. I am ridiculously excited about Ottolenghi's new Jerusalem book, as I've loved everything he's made so far. I have already tried out a couple recipes from the Mile End Cookbook, and can tell it's going to be an obsession all winter. I just spied brown butter snickerdoodles in the new Baked Elements book; I am pretty sure that needs to happen immediately. And I've been cooking out of the Sprouted Kitchen cookbook and everything has been fresh, wholesome and stunning.
Q. What's on your nightstand? Your Kindle?
A. An Everlasting Meal (Tamar Adler), The Tenth Muse (Judith Jones), A Peace To End All Peace (David Fromkin) and I Want My Hat Back (Jon Klassen), all print. Can you guess which one my toddler left there?
Q. What’s your favorite restaurant—or the best place you’ve eaten recently?

The Journey Starts Here

These days, it seems like there are a million and one problems in the world; global warming, droughts, rising food costs, toxic waterways, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, starvation . . . it’s enough to make anyone want to crawl into a hole with a big bowl of ice cream!

Of course you know ice cream’s not the solution. But what if I told you that the ice cream you’re craving is actually one of the causes of every single one of those problems? What if I said that by choosing nondairy ice cream instead, you’d be taking a huge step toward solving them all?

And what about your health? Do you feel like your body is some mystery that only your doctor understands? Do you feel like getting older is just another way of saying “falling apart”? What if I told you that, by eating a varied, plant-based diet, you will strengthen your immune system, beautify your skin, increase your energy, and reduce your risk (signifi cantly) of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, allergies, asthma, and almost every other disease? What if I said that I feel myself getting younger, more powerful, and more beautiful as I age simply because of what I eat? Of course the food we choose is not the only factor in our health and well-being, but it’s definitely one of the most important—and, luckily, it’s one we have control over. How does that nondairy ice cream sound now?

If you want to lose weight, you’ve come to the right place. But, unlike other diet books, I won’t ask you to freak out about calories, carbs, or the glycemic index. With the Kind Diet, your relationship to your body, food, and the concept of dieting itself will transform. By staying away from nasty foods and making friends with grains and vegetables, a whole new, beautiful body will emerge.

And finally, do you feel like you’re at peace with yourself? Comfortable in your own body? In your life? Or are you constantly battling yourself (or others), never feeling whole or balanced? Do you feel like you’re in touch with your heart—your authentic self? I know it might sound crazy to say that your diet is behind that, too, but it is. When you begin to eat whole grains and abstain from craz-ymaking foods like white sugar, you will see how amazing and joyous and peaceful life really is.

By following the Kind Diet, you will lose weight easily, your skin will absolutely glow, you will have tons of energy, and you will become more sensitive to all the important things in life—like love, nature, and your deepest, truest self. By eating this way, you will become stronger. Your immune system will work more efficiently as your body releases excess fats and toxins. Released from the grip of certain foods, your body will begin to heal itself.

So here’s your end of the bargain: Prioritize food. I know, I know, you’re thinking, “I already prioritize food—I’m always on a diet! I think about food all the time!” But that’s not what I mean. It’s time to really reacquaint yourself with actual food , the stuff that comes out of the ground, the stuff that’s designed to go in our bodies, supporting not only our physical functions but our hearts and even our souls.

Here’s another promise that perhaps your tongue needs to hear: You will feel deprived! If you make that single decision to prioritize food, try out some recipes, and explore some great healthy restaurants, you will be amazed at how delicious this food is. I didn’t grow up vegetarian—as a kid my favorite food was pork chops—so I’ve made the transition that I’m asking you to consider. Not only was it possible, it was the best thing I’ve ever done. Period.

By the way, this isn’t a lifestyle designed for celebrities and rich people. I’m not selling you some glamorous program that requires ridiculous equipment, fancy private sessions, or expensive creams. This radiant health is available to every single one of us because it’s nature’s way. I  that! And these days, the food is even cheap; trade in steak for grains and beans, and your grocery bill goes down. Find a local farmers’ market for great prices on organic vegetables. Or even grow your own! You may find, over time, that you see your doctor less often. That you walk more and drive less. That you don’t need that frappuccino, antacid, or sleeping pill.

But that’s not all. One of the things I love best about the Kind Diet is that you will actually become part of the solution to our global problems. Following a plant-based diet dials down our insane consumption of resources like fresh water, oil, coal, and the precious rain forest. It helps to heal the environment by denying support to toxic food industries. It is a significant move toward ending world hunger and distributing food more equitably.

I believe that at the core of every human is love, and it seeks to spread itself—that’s what love’s all about. Your heart will open more than ever and that love will start to spread, affecting all the people in your life. And because the Kind Diet is sustainable, you are—by making simple, delicious choices—loving the whole planet with every single bite. I mean, come on . . . How cool is that?

Finally, deciding to follow a plant-based diet has introduced me to the most amazing individuals—so many of them kind, interesting, and awake. Wonderful people like Woody Harrelson. So I’ll end this introduction with a story: About 10 years ago, right after becoming vegan, I was feeling sort of alone and disconnected. I had bumped into Woody at a number of events, but we’d never really talked, so one day I called him. “Woody,” I said, “I’m so frustrated. I keep learning about food, and the planet, and I feel like I’m going crazy!”

After a moment he said, in his Woody way, “I’m taking a trip to Peru, down the Amazon. Wanna come? We’re trying to save the rain forest.”

“Uhh . . .”

“I’m bringing my wife, Laura, maybe the kids. Bring your boyfriend . . . it’ll be fun.”

Two months later, I met Woody Harrelson officially, for the first time, in the Lima airport. Three days later, he and Christopher were racing canoes down the Amazon, stark naked and paddling furiously, with me and Laura behind them, laughing. Vegan friends are the best.

Since then, I’ve been inspired by the joy Woody and Laura take in living life while simultaneously caring for themselves, their kids, and the earth. Their consciousness magically and mysteriously raises mine. Through this book, I hope I can do the same for you. As you get into this stuff, you will meet people full of hope and light, with a real love for this planet. They will make your life richer and more meaningful than you ever thought possible. And that is the greatest gift of all.

Part 1
Kind versus Nasty

Chapter 1
What's So Kind About Dieting?

diet: (noun) a way of living, or thinking, a day's journey

This was the definition of diet when it entered the English language in the mid-1600s. So simple! So sane! How did this cute little word become synonymous with deprivation, suffering, and—let’s be honest—total hell?

With the Kind Diet, we are returning the word to its original defi nitions, for this journey is about changing how you think and live, one day at a time. And by allowing your mind and your choices to change, you will see amazing—even magical—results. It won’t happen overnight, but it will happen, I promise, because it happened to me: By eating satisfying, delicious, plant-based foods, I was released from the prison of dieting.

Oh, the freedom of that! How amazing it is never to have to start another diet! To be able to think about my life, and the world, instead of spazzing out about calories and constantly asking myself, “Can I eat that?” It’s like I got my brain back! These days, I get to eat as much as I wantof foods that I love, and I never have to fear them. I feel truly and deeply nourished by food. I’mso grateful for that.

But what do I mean by “kind”? Well, let’s start with you. This is about being really, really good to yourself. The Kind Diet will give you tons of energy, mental clarity, gorgeous skin, and a zest for life you won’t want to miss. Plus, it’s powerful; doctors like Dean Ornish and John MacDougall have discovered that plant-based diets have the power to reverse heart disease, diabetes, even cancer.

So this is about treating yourself like a total goddess and putting yourself first. And you deserve that kindness, my friend. I used to equate having self-worth with being selfish, but now I understand that taking care of myself is the most beautiful thing I can do. And quite frankly, I can’t be a good actor, I can’t be a good wife, friend, or mother (to my dogs) . . . I can’t be a good anything until I’ve taken care of myself fi rst. So this kindness to yourself is paramount.

And it doesn’t stop there. Th is kindness extends to the earth itself; because it requires less fuel, water, and other precious resources, a plant-based diet is much lighter on the planet. And because it is clean, this diet helps our soil, water, and atmosphere get healthy as well. You will see that the Kind Diet reduces planetary suff ering on all levels; following a plant-based diet is just about the greenest thing you can do.

But let’s not get ahead of ourselves; this is a process. My own journey, which started quite a while ago and continues to this day, has had its own back-and-forths and big opportunities for learning, growth, and letting go. None of it happened overnight; it took some time, as most transformations do.

We’ll start with my story. It began innocently enough—just a young girl wanting to save some dogs. Little did I know that I was actually stepping into the Magical-Life-Altering-Save-the-World-Soul-Expansion Machine!

You see, I’ve always been an animal-lover. Since I was a little, little girl. And my mom was the same way; if we saw a dog running in the street that looked in need, she’d slam on the brakes, and I’d hop out of the car to run after it—even on the freeway. We were a little dynamic duo. I’m still rescuing dogs to this day.

Every little kid is born with an innate love of animals. Animals are complete and individual creatures, each with a distinct personality, and children connect with that.

But the second you get old enough, people say that relating to animals is juvenile and they try to talk you out of it. I know a lot of people who grew up on farms and were given a piglet or a calf to raise. They loved it and cared for it, like any kid would. And then one day the parent has the animal slaughtered and says, “Toughen up. This is what it is to be a grown-up.”

My love of animals came crashing down on my love of meat at the ripe old age of 8. My brother and I were on an airplane, and when my dinner came, it was a lamb chop. Just as I stuck my fork in, my brother started making sheep sounds and bleating baa baa  like a baby lamb. (He was 13 at this point and knew exactly how to torment me.) Suddenly it all came together in my head and I freaked. I might as well have killed the lamb with my own hands. I decided right there on that flight that I was now a vegetarian.

But what did I know about nutrition or dietary concerns at 8? For the next month I ate nothing but ice cream and eggs. And then my resolve slipped. I stopped and started a lot or “forgot” I had sworn off meat. Truth be told, I think I conveniently forgot because I sure loved pork chops, bacon, steak, and everything else. . . .

At 12, I went to my first acting class. I loved it. I loved being with all the older kids. I loved feeling like I could touch a different world, one that provided so much excitement and possibility. In acting class, I discovered my passion and began to consider the meaning of commitment.

My commitment to not eating animals, however, was faltering. I’d wake up and declare, “I’m a vegetarian today!” but it was sort of hard to keep the resolution. I’d sit with a friend and she’d order a steak and I’d say, “Umm . . . are you going to finish that?” and take a bite. “But I thought you were a vegetarian!” she would remind me, and I’d counter with, “But you can’t eat all that. I don’t want it to go to waste!” I’d use any excuse.

I was 18 when  came out. Going through adolescence is strange enough, but becoming famous at the same time is really weird. It felt good to be recognized as an actor, but after , it was like I was sucked up into a hurricane. You might assume that fame brings you more friends, but I actually became very isolated. I was no longer simply a girl with the freedom to make mistakes and have fun. There was enormous pressure, which put me in full survival mode. And being in survival mode made it hard to stay in touch with my truth; I just couldn’t
hear it anymore.

Well, almost. One of the really  things about being a public person was that animal rights groups were hearing about my passion for their cause and began soliciting my help. I worked on all sorts of campaigns: antidissection, antifur, spay and neuter, as well as animal rescue. All of that stuff made perfect sense to me; in an otherwise chaotic life, these gestures were simple and straightforward and good. But, at that point, nobody had talked to me seriously about vegetarianism, and I was still doing my little dance back and forth.

After a heart-wrenching day at an animal shelter, from which I took home a grand total of 11 dogs who were scheduled for execution, I found myself thinking, “Now what?” I was doing what I needed to do for my heart, but deep down I realized it wasn’t a practical solution; the next day the shelter would just put down another batch of dogs . . . and then another . . . and then another. I was committing my heart, soul, time, and pocketbook to these poor creatures, and that’s when it hit me: How could I spend so much energy saving one group of animals, then turn around and eat other ones? There was a fundamental hypocrisy in my thinking. Weren’t they all living beings? Why did we buy some of them cute little doggy beds while slaughtering others? I had to ask myself—in all seriousness—why don’t I just eat my ?

That realization helped me make up my mind once and for all. I realized that, until I stopped using my dollars to purchase meat or other products that are created through violence or cruelty, the suff ering would never end. It wouldn’t stop because I wanted it to. It wouldn’t stop because I wished  it would. If I really wanted to end cruelty to animals, I had to boycott it completely.

When I got home, I declared to my boyfriend (now husband), Christopher, “I’m going vegan. Forever. You don’t have to,” and I blathered on about wanting to save the pigs and the cows, and the logistics of living with the newly vegan me. I was getting all worked up planning everything out, and he looked at me and said in the sweetest way, “Baby, I don’t want to hurt the pigs either!” Which confirms that I am the luckiest girl on Earth, because he was totally on board with me from day one.

That night we grilled the final steak in our freezer and sat down to our last nonvegan supper. It was quite solemn. I remember crossing myself like a Catholic even though I’m Jewish, because this was a total act of faith; I had never tried to cook without meat. I wasn’t sure I would ever eat a yummy meal again.

But after only 2 weeks of being vegan, people were beginning to ask, “What is going on with you? You look amazing!” I was still eating lots of white pasta, french fries, and all sorts of sludgy things (in fact, I still do sometimes). All I’d given up was meat and dairy, and yet I began to look better in just 2 weeks!

Something really wild was happening  of me, too. I noticed that my whole body felt lighter. I was more vibrant and spunky. I felt like my heart had sort of opened a bit and my shoulders could relax, as if an overall softening had taken place. I no longer carried heavy animal protein in my body, which takes tons of energy to digest. Plus, I didn’t have the heaviness of the suffering in me; frightened animals produce lots of cortisol and adrenaline right before slaughter, and we can become stressed from eating their meat.

Something seemed to be happening on a deeper level as well. The decision to be vegan was one I made purely for me, an expression of my truest self and deepest beliefs. It was the first time I’d stood up and said a definitive “NO!” My real self began to emerge. It was powerful.

One afternoon, a few years later, Christopher came home and announced that he wanted to try a macrobiotic diet. He’d read interviews with people who claimed that this diet made them feel balanced and happy and he was intrigued. I’d heard (incorrectly, as it turns out) that macrobiotics was only for sick people and that fish was a requisite part of the diet. No way was that for me! He looked at me with that sweet face of his and said, “Alright, baby. I’m going to do macrobiotics, but you don’t have to.”

Ironically, I was exploring another diet dimension myself at the time—raw foods. I was eating tons of fruit, nuts, and other cool, uncooked delicacies. Although I felt fine in sunny California, when I went to snowy, cold Manhattan to appear opposite Kathleen Turner and Jason Biggs in The Graduate on Broadway, it was another story. After a few days of work, my body felt cold and my energy was low, but I was determined to stick to my raw regimen. Between rehearsals, I would go out into the winter weather to hunt down wheatgrass juice, pineapples, and mangoes. I found them—it was New York, after all—but I wasn’t feeling all that good. My brain didn’t want to know, but my body was giving me signals that I was out of balance.

At work, I was teased by the other members of the cast for my “extreme” diet. I swear Jason deliberately ordered veal and rabbit just to make me crazy. Whenever I yawned or seemed tired, the director announced, “It’s because you’re not eating any meat!”

It’s funny how the puzzle pieces of your life drop into place; during that same stint in New York, I went to Candle Caf. (one of my favorite restaurants), and I noticed Temple, a waitress who I hadn’t seen in years. She was absolutely on fire. Her hair, her skin, and her body just looked amazing. She told me she’d seen a macrobiotic counselor, and now she was the healthiest she’d ever been in her life. I decided I would give Christopher a consultation with her counselor for his birthday. If she looked so fantastic, there had to be something to this macro business, right?

By the time the appointment rolled around, though, my defenses had reemerged. When we got to the counselor’s office, I sat with my arms crossed, thinking, “This is stupid.” She politely ignored me and worked with Christopher to design a regimen for him. Just as we were getting ready to leave, she turned to me and said, “Maybe you should try this, too. You could have more energy, and I could help you clear up your acne.” Damn. She had noticed. But of course everyone did. Since going off the pill a few years before, my skin had become a nightmare, with really cystic acne. I’d even had to reshoot a scene for a movie because my skin looked so bad.

But she wasn’t done. “Do you know how much energy is consumed to transport some of the food you’re eating?” she asked. “These coconuts and pineapples and mangoes are flown in from all over the world. That’s a huge waste of fuel.” I had never thought about it, but of course she was right.

Sensing that my resistance was faltering, she pressed on. “How can these foods be good for you, in the dead of winter, in New York? If you eat something from another climate, how is your body supposed to cope with it? Your body is here, in cold New York. And the mango is designed to cool people off in tropical climates.” She definitely had my attention now. “You need to eat what’s indigenous to the area to avoid stressing your body.” This made perfect sense to me on a holistic level.

Between the acne and the mangoes and the excessive energy consumption, she had won me over. I decided to give it a try, and within a week of following her recommendations, my acne—which had haunted me for such a long time—had improved significantly. It was like magic.

But that’s the Superhero diet, and I don’t expect anyone to go full Superhero overnight. The simplest elements of the counselor’s recommendations were to add whole grains to my diet at every meal. I also had miso soup almost every day and totally cranked up the vegetables. I made sure that everything I was eating was local and seasonal, choosing apples over pineapples. In terms of letting go, I said good-bye to white sugar, substituting sweeteners like rice syrup and maple syrup. I also gave up white flour and processed foods and, of course, still no meat or dairy.

A few tweaks and everything changed.

Although I felt good as a vegan, I had even more energy when I adopted the macrobiotic suggestions. At the same time, I was very calm and at peace within myself. My mind focused easily and my thinking became really clear. Although I had lost weight by going vegan, the macrobiotic diet helped me shed the few extra pounds I was holding on to and brought me to my perfect body eff ortlessly.

Over time, I became more sensitive. I started to feel things more acutely and sense my intuition. People used to say, “Listen to your body,” and I had no idea what they meant. “What is my body saying? I don’t know . . . it’s
just here !” But soon I really understood; my body was trying to tell me things all the time, and once I stripped away all the layers of crap inside, I could hear it.

As I aligned more with nature and the seasons, I aligned more with myself. Instead of constantly relying on the people around me for direction, I felt I was on my own journey and I was beginning to sense—from inside of me—each next right step.

Which brings me to this book. I’ve known for quite a while that I wanted to help other people become their best selves. And, in fact, for the last few years, I’ve seen how my practice has influenced the people around me. The information I have to share is powerful because the food is powerful. Literally. Your deepest, truest self is released through food.

I encourage you to let this book gently lift your awareness, and you will begin to make the changes that work for you. Th ere are plenty of little choices you can make—choices that will make huge impacts—without getting all uptight and thinking you have to be perfect.

Based on these stages I went through, I have designed three diff erent approaches to the Kind Diet—each one for a different level of readiness—and you can choose according to what feels right to you. The first plan is called Flirting, and it’s simply sticking your toe in the pool of the Kind Diet. The second plan is Vegan; it’s for experienced Flirts and those of you who, after reading this book, want to commit to a plant-based diet. The third plan, Superhero, emphasizes whole grains, organic vegetables, and sea vegetables and will make you levitate. (Well, almost.)

So as you read, keep in mind that these diff erent levels exist; that no matter where you’re coming from, there’s plenty of room for you on this path. Whether it takes you 2 weeks or 10 years  to make my delicious rice crispy treats matters not a jot. It’s your path, based on what you think and feel while reading this book. You will know what’s right for you.

But before you choose your path, let’s dine on some information. It’s only by digesting and absorbing pertinent facts that you can make an informed choice. In the following chapters, we look closely at specific foods and the very real impact they have on our bodies and our world.

A visit to her doctor revealed that she was anemic, vitamin D deficient, and that her stress levels were sky high. He prescribed an elimination diet to clear out her system and help her body heal.

An avid foodie, Paltrow was concerned that so many restrictions would make mealtime boring, so, together with Julia Turshen, she compiled a collection of 185 delicious, easy recipes that followed her doctor's guidelines.

In Pressure Cooker Perfection, the first volume in our new test kitchen handbook series, the editors at America's Test Kitchen demystify an appliance that to many home cooks remains intimidating -- but shouldn't. Modern pressure cookers are safer, quieter, more reliable, and more user-friendly than old-fashioned jiggle-top models. And they can prepare a wide range of foods -- everything from barbecue to risotto -- in record time.

Cooking under pressure results in better-tasting dishes because every drop of flavor is trapped in the sealed pot. This fact, combined with the shorter cooking time, means that your dishes will be supercharged with flavor. And cooking under pressure is versatile. While they're ideal for roasts and stews, pressure cookers can also turn out perfectly tender beans, grains, and legumes in short order.

If ever there was a cooking method that could benefit from the obsessive trial and error that our test kitchen is known for, this is it. When cooking time is compressed, every minute matters, and when flavors are amplified, even a small change becomes significant. We ran hundreds of tests in fifteen pressure cookers to find out what works and what doesn't, and we deliver the foolproof, guaranteed-successful recipes in Pressure Cooker Perfection.

After a lifetime of obesity, following this way of eating began as a desperate plan to lose weight and evolved into a journey to manage my health and not just my weight. While I enjoy eating the best foods of my life and losing weight, I also have come to appreciate that my overall health has improved. I no longer need any of the four medications that I was on before I started keto. I no longer wait in the car or at the hotel while my family hikes. Now I’m the one who suggests that we go for walk or go kayaking or play at the pool.
My husband and I have been on a ketogenic diet since June 2013, yet one of our physicians still asks whether this “diet” is sustainable in spite of our having lost a combined 180 lbs! Moreover, my husband's blood pressure has gone from the verge of needing medication to being low normal. Still, the physician asks if we can sustain it long term. In fact, more than one medical professional has told me that this way of eating is “too difficult to follow” or “too restrictive”.
One of the goals of this cookbook is to prove that notion wrong. This cookbook has the ""everyday"" recipes that my family and I have enjoyed on our very own journey to health. There are some low carb “treat”, but the majority of the recipes in this book are the simple recipes that have become part of our day to day lives. There are delicious, filling breakfasts that will keep your tummy happy when it’s tired of scrambled eggs and bacon and hearty sides that will never make you feel deprived. This is “diet” food that you will be proud to share at any potluck and your “carbivore” friends will expect you to share! I snuck in a few very low carb treats for birthdays, holidays, or special occasions because these are the foods with which we have also celebrated on our journey. It is my sincere wish that these recipes can help you sustain a very low carb diet as a delicious life style.

“In her , the ingenious celiac Elana Amsterdam offers another possible approach, a sandwich bread made from finely milled almond flour (do not use Bob's Red Mill brand) and almond butter that is nutty and versatile.

But the ground nut has other virtues, including high amounts of protein and vitamins and low glycemic impact. Amsterdam employs it in a range of dishes, from shortbread cookies and carrot cake to a savory tart with kale. Her snappy herbed crackers, which are a welcome change from commercial nut-thins and dry rice crisps, are equally easy to make and delicious.”

CHAPTER 1

LIBERATE YOUR INNER COW: LIFE UNGRAINED

Goldfish do not eat sausages.

—John Cleese, ""How to Feed a Goldfish,"" Monty Python's Flying Circus

SINCE YOU ARE reading this book, I take it that you are a member of the species Homo sapiens. You are likely not a giraffe, toad, or woodpecker. Nor are you a ruminant, those taciturn creatures that graze on grass.

Ruminants, such as goats and cows, and their ancient, wild counterparts, ibex and aurochs, enjoy evolutionary adaptations that allow them to consume grasses. They have continuously growing teeth to compensate for the wear generated by coarse, sandlike phytolith particles in grass blades; produce in excess of 100 quarts of saliva per day; have four-compartment stomachs that host unique microorganisms to digest grass components, including a compartment that grinds and then regurgitates its contents up as a cud to rechew; and a long, spiral colon that's also host to microorganisms that further digest grassy remains. In other words, ruminants have a gastrointestinal system uniquely specialized to consume grasses.

You don't look, smell, or act like a ruminant. Then why would you eat like one?

Those of you who have already forgone wheat do not, of course. But if you remain of the ""healthy whole grain""-consuming persuasion, you have fallen victim to believing that grasses should be your primary source of calories. Just as Kentucky bluegrass and ryegrass in your backyard are grasses from the biological family Poaceae, so are wheat, rye, barley, corn, rice, bulgur, sorghum, triticale, millet, teff, and oats. You grow teeth twice in your life, then stop, leaving you to make do for a lifetime with a prepubertal set that erupted around age 10; produce a meager quart of saliva per day; have three fewer stomach compartments unpopulated by foreign organisms and without grinding action; don't chew a cud; and have a relatively uninteresting, linear, nonspiral colon. These adaptations allow you to be omnivorous--but not to consume grasses.

Early members of our species found nourishment through scavenging, and then hunting, animals such as gazelles, turtles, birds, and fish, and consuming the edible parts of plants, including fruit and roots, as well as mushrooms, nuts, and seeds. Hungry humans instinctively regarded all of these as food. About 10,000 years ago, during a period of increasing temperature and dryness in the Fertile Crescent, humans observed the ibex and aurochs grazing on einkorn, the ancient predecessor of modern wheat. Our hungry, omnivorous ancestors asked, ""Can we eat that, too?"" They did, and surely got sick: vomiting, cramps, and diarrhea. At the very least they simply passed wheat plants out undigested, since humans lack the ruminant digestive apparatus. Grass plants in their intact form are unquestionably unappetizing. We somehow figured out that for humans, the only edible part of the einkorn plant was the seed--not the roots, not the stem, not the leaves, not the entire seed head--just the seed, and even that was only edible after the outer husk was removed and the seed was chewed or crushed with rocks and then heated in crude pottery over fire. Only then could we consume the seeds of this grass as porridge, a practice that served us well in times of desperation when ibex meat, bird eggs, and figs were in short supply.

Similar grass-consuming adventures occurred with teosinte and maize (the ancestors of modern corn) in the Americas; rice from the swamps of Asia; and sorghum and millet in sub-Saharan Africa, all requiring similar manipulations to allow the edible part--the seed--to be consumed by humans. Some grasses, such as sorghum, posed other obstacles; its content of poisons (such as hydrocyanic acid, or cyanide) results in sudden death when the plant is consumed before maturity. Natural evolution of grasses led to wheat strains such as emmer, spelt, and kamut as wheat exchanged genes from other wild grasses, while humans selected strains of corn with larger seeds and seed heads (cobs).

What happened to those first humans, hungry and desperate, who figured out how to make this one component of grasses--the seed--edible? Incredibly, anthropologists have known this for years. The first humans to consume the grassy food of the ibex and aurochs experienced explosive tooth decay; shrinkage of the maxillary bone and mandible, resulting in tooth crowding; iron deficiency; and scurvy. They also experienced a reduction in bone diameter and length, resulting in a loss of as much as 5 inches in height for men and 3 inches for women.1

The deterioration of dental health is especially interesting, as dental decay was uncommon prior to the consumption of the seeds of grasses, affecting less than 1 percent of all teeth recovered, despite the lack of toothbrushes, toothpaste, fluoridated water, dental floss, and dentists. Even though they lacked any notion of dental hygiene (aside from possibly using a twig to pick the fibers of wild boar from between their teeth), dental decay was simply not a problem that beset many members of our species prior to the consumption of grains. The notion of toothless savages is all wrong; they enjoyed sturdy, intact teeth for their entire lives. It was only after humans began to resort to the seeds of grasses for calories that mouths of rotten and crooked teeth began to appear in children and adults. From that point on, decay was evident in 16 to 49 percent of all teeth recovered, along with tooth loss and abscesses, making tooth decay as commonplace as bad hair among humans of the agricultural Neolithic Age.2

In short, when we started consuming the seeds of grasses 10,000 years ago, this food source may have allowed us to survive another day, week, or month during times when foods we had instinctively consumed during the preceding 2.5 million years fell into short supply. But this expedient represents a dietary pattern that constitutes only 0.4 percent--less than one-half of 1 percent--of our time on earth. This change in dietary fortunes was accompanied by a substantial price. From the standpoint of oral health, humans remained in the Dental Dark Ages from their first taste of porridge all the way up until recent times. History is rich with descriptions of toothaches, oral abscesses, and stumbling and painful efforts to extract tainted teeth. Remember George Washington and his mouthful of wooden false teeth? It wasn't until the 20th century that modern dental hygiene was born and we finally managed to keep most of our teeth through adulthood.

Fast-forward to the 21st century: Modern wheat now accounts for 20 percent of all calories consumed by humans; the seeds of wheat, corn, and rice combined make up 50 percent.3 Yes, the seeds of grasses provide half of all human calories. We have become a grass seed-consuming species, a development enthusiastically applauded by agencies such as the USDA, which advises us that increasing our consumption to 60 percent of calories or higher is a laudable dietary goal. It's also a situation celebrated by all of those people who trade grain on an international scale, since the seeds of grasses have a prolonged shelf life (months to years) that allows transoceanic shipment, they're easy to store, they don't require refrigeration, and they're in demand worldwide--all the traits desirable in a commoditized version of food. The transformation of foodstuff into that of a commodity that's tradeable on a global scale allows financial manipulations, such as buying and selling futures, hedges, and complex derivative instruments--the tools of mega-commerce--to emerge. You can't do that with organic blueberries or Atlantic salmon.

Examine the anatomy of a member of the species Homo sapiens and you cannot escape the conclusion that you are not a ruminant, have none of the adaptive digestive traits of such creatures, and can only consume the seeds of grasses--the food of desperation--by accepting a decline in your health. But the seeds of grasses can be used to feed the masses cheaply, quickly, and on a massive scale, all while generating huge profits for those who control the flow of these commoditized foods.

MUTANT NINJA GRASSES

The seeds of grasses, known to us more familiarly as ""grains"" or ""cereals,"" have always been a problem for us nonruminant creatures. But then busy geneticists and agribusiness got into the act. That's when grains went from bad to worse.

Readers of the original know that modern wheat is no longer the 4 1/2-foot-tall traditional plant we all remember; it is now an 18-inch-tall plant with a short, thick stalk; long seed head; and larger seeds. It has a much greater yield per acre than its traditional predecessors. This high- yield strain of wheat, now the darling of agribusiness, was not created through genetic modification, but through repetitive hybridizations, mating wheat with non-wheat grasses to introduce new genes (wheat is a grass, after all) and through mutagenesis, the use of high-dose x-rays, gamma rays, and chemicals to induce mutations. Yes: Modern wheat is, to a considerable degree, a grass that contains an array of mutations, some of which have been mapped and identified, many of which have not. Such uncertainties never faze agribusiness, however. Unique mutated proteins? No problem. The USDA and FDA say they're okay, too--perfectly fine for public consumption.

Over the years, there have been many efforts to genetically modify wheat, such as by using gene-splicing technology to insert or delete a gene. However, public resistance has dampened efforts to bring genetically modified (GM) wheat to market, so no wheat currently sold is, in the terminology of genetics, ""genetically modified."" (There have been recent industry rumblings, however, that make the prospect of true GM wheat a probable reality in the near future.) All of the changes introduced into modern wheat are the results of methods that predate the technology to create GM foods. This does not mean that the methods used to change wheat were benign; in fact, the crude and imprecise methods used to change wheat, such as chemical mutagenesis, have the potential to be worse than genetic modification, yielding a greater number of unanticipated changes in genetic code than the handful introduced through gene-splicing.4

Corn and rice, on the other hand, have been genetically modified, in addition to undergoing other changes. For instance, scientists introduced genes to make corn resistant to the herbicide glyphosate and to express Bacillus thurigiensis (Bt), a toxin that kills insects, while rice has been genetically modified to make it resistant to the herbicide glufosinate and to express beta-carotene (a variety called Golden Rice). Problem: While, in theory, the notion of just inserting one silly gene seems simple and straightforward, it is anything but. The methods of gene insertion remain crude. The site of insertion--which chromosome, within or alongside other genes, within or without various control elements--not to mention disruption of epigenetic effects that control gene expression, cannot be controlled with current technology. And it's misleading to say that only one gene is inserted, as the methods used usually require several genes to be inserted. (We discuss the nature of specific changes in GM grains in Chapter 2.)

The wheat, corn, and rice that make up 50 percent of the human diet in the 21st century are not the wheat, corn, and rice of the 20th century. They're not the wheat, corn, and rice of the Middle Ages, nor of the Bible, nor of the Egyptian empire. And they are definitely not the same wheat, corn, and rice that was harvested by those early hungry humans. They are what I call ""Frankengrains"": hybridized, mutated, genetically modified to suit the desires of agribusiness, and now available at a supermarket, convenience store, or school near you.

Wheat: What Changed . . . and Why Are the Changes So Bad?

All strains of wheat, including traditional strains like spelt and emmer, are problems for nonruminant humans who consume them. But modern wheat is the worst.

Modern wheat looks different: shorter, thicker shaft, larger seeds. The reduction in height is due to mutations in Rh (reduced height) genes that code for the protein gibberellin, which controls stalk length. This one mutant gene is accompanied by other mutations. Changes in Rh genes are thereby accompanied by other changes in the genetic code of the wheat plant.5 There's more here than meets the eye.

Gliadin

While gluten is often fingered as the source of wheat's problems, it's really gliadin, a protein within gluten, that is the culprit behind many destructive health effects of modern wheat. There are more than 200 forms of gliadin proteins, all incompletely digestible.6 One important change that has emerged over the past 50 years, for example, is increased expression of a gene called Glia-α9, which yields a gliadin protein that is the most potent trigger for celiac disease. While the Glia-α9 gene was absent from most strains of wheat from the early 20th century, it is now present in nearly all modern varieties,7 likely accounting for the 400 percent increase in celiac disease witnessed since 1948.8

New gliadin variants are partially digested into small peptides that enter the bloodstream and then bind to opiate receptors in the human brain--the same receptors activated by heroin and morphine.9 Researchers call these peptides ""exorphins,"" or exogenous morphine-like com£ds. Gliadin-derived peptides, however, generate no ""high,"" but they do trigger increased appetite and increased calorie consumption, with studies demonstrating consistent increases of 400 calories per day, mostly from carbohydrates.

Gluten

Gluten (gliadin + glutenins) is the stuff that confers the stretchiness unique to wheat dough. Gluten is a popular additive in processed foods such as sauces, instant soups, and frozen foods, which means the average person ingests between 15 and 20 grams (g) per day.10 Gluten has been genetically manipulated to improve the baking characteristics of its glutenin. Geneticists have therefore crossbred wheat strains repeatedly, bred wheat with non-wheat grasses to introduce new genes, and used chemicals and radiation to induce mutations. Breeding methods used to alter gluten quality do not result in predictable changes. Hybridizing two different wheat plants yields as many as 14 unique glutenin proteins never before encountered by humans.11

Wheat Germ Agglutinin

The genetic changes inflicted on wheat have altered the structure of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a protein in wheat that provides protection against molds and insects. The structure of WGA in modern wheat, for instance, differs from that of ancient wheat strains.12 WGA is indigestible and toxic, resistant to any breakdown in the human body, and unchanged by cooking, baking, and sourdough fermentation. Unlike gluten and gliadin, which require genetic susceptibility to exert some of their negative effects, WGA does its damage directly. WGA alone is sufficient to generate celiac disease-like intestinal damage by disrupting microvilli, the absorptive ""hairs"" of intestinal cells.13

George Bryant is the creative genius behind the wildly popular Paleo food blog Civilized Caveman Cooking Creations. After spending the first 20-something years of his life in a constant battle with his weight, and then nearly losing both his legs while deployed as a U.S. Marine, George took matters into his own hands and began his Paleo journey. What started as a simple place to post recipes for friends has since become an award-winning food blog. After serving in the Marines for 12 years, George now enjoys working full-time creating delicious Paleo recipes, hoping to change many lives for the better by making simple and tasty real food dishes.

Juli Bauer is a self-described foodie who creates Paleo versions of grain-filled favorites on her extremely successful blog, PaleOMG. She started the blog to help friends make the transition to Paleo a little more easily, only to see it grow from a few readers to more than 100,000 and counting in just eight months. The popularity of PaleOMG can be attributed to Juli’s refreshing honesty about her own trials and tribulations and to her mouthwatering recipes -- and to her heartwarming personality.

From Publishers Weekly
Starred Review. Ten years have brought many changes to the U.S. culinary landscape, and Bittman's new edition of his contemporary classic reflects that, with hundreds of recipes added, out-of-date ones banished and few lines from the holdovers left untouched. The opening chapter offers invaluable new tips on basic kitchen equipment and techniques, and in the wake of the recent vegetarian version of the book, produce and legumes are now featured earlier and with more inspired meatless recipes. Overall, Bittman's globe-trotting palate shows even better than it did in the already quite international first edition, with intriguing recipes from every corner of the world. Considering these expansions, the most important change has been to the book's user-friendliness: a proliferation of charts, lists and boxes makes much more information immediately available—hardly a page goes by without an eye-catching sidebar about technique, a handy table organizing the basics of an ingredient or dish or the myriad suggestions of variations and new ways to think about a recipe that make it the best-value all-in-one volume available. At-a-glance coding to indicate what is fast to make, what can be made ahead and what is vegetarian, plus highlighted recipes that Bittman considers essential, help ensure that even with more of everything to cook, this massive tome is navigable. Whether the first edition is on their shelves or not, home cooks of all skill levels will want to get this one. (Oct.)

This haunting, harrowing, gloriously moving recollection of a life on the American margin is the story of Rick Bragg, who grew up dirt-poor in northeastern Alabama, seemingly destined for either the cotton mills or the penitentiary, and instead became a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The New York Times. It is the story of Bragg's father, a hard-drinking man with a murderous temper and the habit of running out on the people who needed him most.

But at the center of this soaring memoir is Bragg's mother, who went eighteen years without a new dress so that her sons could have school clothes and picked other people's cotton so that her children wouldn't have to live on welfare alone. Evoking these lives--and the country that shaped and nourished them--with artistry, honesty, and compassion, Rick Bragg brings home the love and suffering that lie at the heart of every family.

From the Author
This is a book about getting even with life.
It is the story of a young woman who absorbed the cruelties of her husband, an alcoholic, haunted Korean War veteran, until she could stand it no more, then gave up her whole life for her children. By picking cotton, cleaning toilets for the gentry, doing worse, she made sure that her three surviving sons would not have to walk around ashamed, in ragged clothes.
In a smaller way it is my story, the boy who climbed up her backbone and made it out of that ring of poverty and ignorance, free and clean. It is about what I did with the life she gave me, and how I tried to repay her, and how I tried--and failed so miserably--to rewrite the past.
The book is set in rural northeastern Alabama, and chronicles a poor, white trash family through three generations. The first third of the book is mostly about her and him, and us, me and my brothers, as babies. It shows the agony of the death of a baby brother who did not have to die, who didn't even get a name.
It also takes us with my father to Korea. He tugged me there, the last time I saw him alive, when I was just 16. The tales of terror he told me there still sit like a broken bottle in my mind.
The second third is about the wonderful life she gave me, the exotic, dark places I went, taking her spirit with me, like a talisman. It takes us to Haiti, to the transvestite hookers in the Village, to death row in Angola, Louisiana.
The last part is the getting even part, where a woman who had never been on a plane, never been higher than a second-story bathroom floor, travels to New York to see her son receive a Pulitzer Prize, and more.

Despite what health science has beaten into us over the last fifty or so years, humans thrive on high-fat, low-carb diets. Millions of people around the world have discovered that a ketogenic lifestyle is the key to weight loss, disease prevention and intervention, and a more vibrant life. Gone are the days of constant hunger and low energy. This book leads you on a path to better health, a slimmer waistline, elimination of cravings, and endless energy.

How you can beat cancer, obesity, metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease, high cholesterol, Alzheimer’s, dementia, ADHD, anxiety, and depression into submission by making some simple yet impactful changes to your diet.
How cholesterol and diabetes medications could very well be making you sicker rather than better.
How generations of bad advice—designed to sell sugar, not health—has killed millions who blindly trusted the medical community and, worse still, the government to tell them the truth.
How overconsumption of carbohydrates is bad for your health and could be at the root of what ails you.
How changing your inputs—the foods you eat—can change your outputs, meaning your quality of life.
How our bodies work, including oxidative priority, fat flux, and lipolysis, explained in such a way that everyone can understand how our bodies really process what we put into them.
How inflammation is at the root of many diseases and how modern diets that are rife with sugar, carbs, and omega-6 oils are sending us to early graves.
How hormones control mood swings, sex drive, blood sugar levels, muscle tone, fat-burning ability, metabolism, the immune system, and much more—and how adopting a ketogenic lifestyle can change your waistline and your life!
How to stock your pantry with the right foods and make meal plans that are delicious and easy to follow and, most importantly, are the pathway to a longer, healthier life.
How you can build muscle and perform at your best on a low-carb, high-fat diet. No, we’re not making that up!
Which foods are the most nutrient dense to feed our cells the vitamins and minerals they need.
How to sort through the confusion and conflicting information about what a ketogenic diet is. This book clears it all up, dispelling the myths of ketogenic diets.

“A book that makes familiar drinks seem new again . . . Through this horticultural lens, a mixed drink becomes a cornucopia of plants.”—NPR's Morning Edition

“Amy Stewart has a way of making gardening seem exciting, even a little dangerous.” —The New York Times

Sake began with a grain of rice. Scotch emerged from barley, tequila from agave, rum from sugarcane, bourbon from corn. Thirsty yet?  In The Drunken Botanist, Amy Stewart explores the dizzying array of herbs, flowers, trees, fruits, and fungi that humans have, through ingenuity, inspiration, and sheer desperation, contrived to transform into alcohol over the centuries.
Of all the extraordinary and obscure plants that have been fermented and distilled, a few are dangerous, some are downright bizarre, and one is as ancient as dinosaurs—but each represents a unique cultural contribution to our global drinking traditions and our history.
This fascinating concoction of biology, chemistry, history, etymology, and mixology—with more than fifty drink recipes and growing tips for gardeners—will make you the most popular guest at any cocktail party.",3884,"Amazon.com Review
An Amazon Best Book of the Month, March 2013: Peppered with fascinating facts and well-chosen anecdotes, Amy Stewart’s brisk tour of the origin of spirits acquaints the curious cocktail fan with every conceivable ingredient. Starting with the classics (from agave to wheat), she touches on obscure sources--including a tree that dates to the dinosaur age--before delving into the herbs, spices, flowers, trees, fruits, and nuts that give the world’s greatest drinks distinctive flavors. Along the way, you’ll enjoy sidebars on bugs in booze and inspired drink recipes with backstories that make lively cocktail party conversation. Like Wicked Plants, this delightfully informative, handsome volume isn’t intended as a complete reference or DIY guide, but it will demystify and heighten your appreciation of every intoxicating plant you imbibe. --Mari Malcolm

Review
""Amy Stewart has a way of making gardening seem exciting, even a little dangerous."" —The New York Times

""Many boozy books have been published over the years, spilling over with fun facts about absinthe, grog and bathtub gin. What makes Stewart's book different is her infectious enthusiasm for the plants, their uses, their history, and the botanists who roamed the earth finding them. The result is intoxicating but in a fresh, happy, healthy way."" —USA Today

""The Drunken Botanist is a sipping book, not a quaffing book, best enjoyed in moderation...Part Ripley’s Believe It or Not, part compendium on the order of 'Schott’s Original Miscellany' and part botanical garden tour, albeit with a curated cocktail party at the end . . . a companionable reference and whimsical recitation of historical-botanical trivia, with a little tart debunking."" —The Washington Post

""Sipping an evening cocktail while flipping through this fine volume, I discovered that Ms. Stewart knew how to change a run-of-the-mill cocktail into an intriguing one."" —The Wall Street Journal

""A book that makes familiar drinks seem new again…Through this horticultural lens, a mixed drink becomes a cornucopia of plants."" —NPR's Morning Edition

""Fascinating, well researched and instructive — with appealing recipes too."" —Rosie Schaap, New York Times

""Gardening can be an intoxicating hobby, especially if the botany is booze-related."" —

Part one, Lose It, includes a two-week intro program designed to result in six to 10 pounds of weight loss, provided readers take up five new habits, including eating breakfast and upping their intake of whole grains, while quitting five old habits, like eating in front of the TV. Part two, Live It, modifies those techniques to sustain one to two pounds of weight loss a week. Part three helps readers with immediate and long-term challenges like behavior modification and stress, as well as meal planning and eating out. Efficiently organized with convenient reference points, this is a worthy guide for any determined dieter. (Jan.)

   • 2/3 cup dried cranberries
   • 2/3 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (2 oranges)
   • 3 tablespoons sherry wine vinegar
   • 2 garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane
   • 6 ounces baby arugula
   • 6 ounces goat cheese, such as Montrachet, medium-diced
   • 2/3 cup roasted, salted Marcona almonds

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Trim and scrub the carrots. If the carrots are more than 1 inch in diameter, cut them in half lengthwise. Cut the carrots in large diagonal slices 1 inch wide × 2 inches long (they will shrink when they roast) and place in a medium bowl with ¼ cup of olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper. Toss well and transfer to two sheet pans. (If you use just one, they’ll steam instead of roasting.) Roast for 20 minutes, tossing once, until the carrots are tender. Transfer all the carrots to one of the sheet pans, add the maple syrup, toss, and roast for 10 to 15 minutes, until the edges are caramelized. Watch them carefully! Toss with a metal spatula and set aside for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine the cranberries and orange juice in a small saucepan, bring to a simmer, then set aside for 10 minutes.

In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, garlic, and ½ teaspoon salt. Whisk in 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Place the arugula in a large bowl and add the carrots, cranberries (with their liquid), goat cheese, almonds, and the vinaigrette. Toss with large spoons, sprinkle with salt, and serve at room temperature.

Watch the pounds disappear—with the press of a button! That’s all it takes to blend up a Zero Belly Smoothie, a unique mix of supernutrients that will flatten your gut, boost your metabolism, heal your digestive system, and turn off your fat genes for good.
 
With fat-burning proteins and a specially selected array of high-powered fruits and vegetables, Zero Belly Smoothies—based on the New York Times bestseller Zero Belly Diet—are the fastest and most delicious ways ever created to sip off the pounds!
 
Inside you’ll find a complete shopping guide, a bonus cleanse program, and more than 100 intensely flavorful recipes, including tasty green drinks, fresh and fruity smoothies, nutty, chocolatey shakes, and savory surprises.
 
Zero Belly Smoothies will help you
• Lose up to 16 pounds in 14 days.
• Melt away stubborn fat, from your belly first.
• Put an end to bloating and discomfort.
• Detox from unhealthy foods so you enjoy all-day energy.
• Turn off your fat storage genes and make long-term weight loss effortless.
• Look and feel younger and healthier than ever!
 
You’ll be stunned and inspired by the results of an amazing 500-person test panel—men and women who lost weight quickly, and with ease, following the original Zero Belly diet, which included many of these Zero Belly Smoothies. In just the first 14 days
Bob McMicken, 51, lost 16.3 pounds.
Kyle Cambridge, 28, lost 15 pounds.
Martha Chesler, 54, lost 11 pounds.
Matt Brunner, 43, lost 14 pounds.
 
Focusing your weight-loss efforts on drinks will help you quickly strip away flab in a number of ways. Here’s what makes Zero Belly Smoothies so effective:
 
1. They take the stress out of cooking and eating well.
Studies have shown that the more diverse your diet, the more likely you are to experience weight gain. In fact, those who ate the widest range of foods showed a 120 percent greater increase in waist circumference compared with those who had the least diversity. In other words, people who have the best success at weight loss pick a set number of foods and tend to stick to them. Zero Belly Smoothies allow you to do exactly that.
 
2. They crowd out the junk in your diet.
Zero Belly Smoothies come in all different flavors—chocolatey, fruity, green, and even savory—but they all have one thing in common: no added sugars. In a 2015 study in Sweden, researchers followed 42,400 men over the course of 12 years. They found that men who consumed at least two servings per day of sweetened beverages had a 23 percent higher risk of heart failure compared with those who did not.
 
3. They battle food allergies and reduce inflammation.
What’s also unique about Zero Belly Smoothies is that they are vegan: no milk, no yogurt, no whey protein. Plant-based protein powders are a low-sugar, high-fiber alternative to popular dairy-based supplements. A study by the University of Tampa that compared plant protein with whey found it to be equally as effective at changing body composition and boosting muscle recovery and growth!
 
4. They make you feel fuller longer!
Studies show that high-protein smoothies are highly effective at rushing nutrients to your muscles and that blended fruit drinks, which include all the fiber, will actually keep you fuller longer than fruit juices.",12539,,"About the Author

If you had the power to make your life better with the push of a button, would you use it?
Well, that power is yours. With one simple whir, you can turn your body into a hyper-efficient fat-burning machine by revving up your metabolism, toning and defining your muscles, and turning off the genes that contribute to fat storage and myriad chronic health issues.
All you need is a blender, and the recipes in this book.
Zero Belly Smoothies are plant-based protein drinks that have been shown to make a dramatic impact on people’s lives in as little as 72 hours. They will flatten your belly, heal your digestive system and strip away unwanted fat in just days. All you need to do is blend them up and drink them down.
I know these smoothies will work for you, and fast, because I’ve seen them work for so many others. Consider the case of Fred Sparks. A 39-year-old emergency-response advisor from Katy, Texas, Fred used Zero Belly Smoothies as part of his weight-loss program. “I noticed results in the first week,” he says. “It really was amazing.” Fred lost 21 pounds and 5 inches off his waist in just the next six weeks.
Martha Chesler, 52, who lost 21 pounds and 7 inches off her waist in less than 40 days, had the same experience:
“I saw results immediately.” she says. In fact, our original Zero Belly Test Panel of more than 500 men and women lost as much as 3 inches off their waist in less than a week, and 16 pounds in the first 14 days. Now, you can achieve results like these even more quickly, with this carefully created, highly effective sample of the delicious drinks you’ll find in Zero Belly Smoothies.
 

They are fast, effective, simple to whip up, and delicious, which makes them ideal for a weight loss program. Consider the proof:
In a 2012 study in researchers put a group of obese adults on a regimen in which they replaced breakfast and dinner with a high-protein smoothie. That was all: no exercise, no limit on what else they could eat. After 12 weeks, the subjects lost up to 18.5 pounds and reported significant improvements in “physical functioning, general health, vitality, and mental health.”
A high-protein diet featuring meal- replacement drinks is more effective than exercise at helping people lose weight and keep it off, according to a 2013 meta- analysis of 20 studies in
Five percent of your body weight is the gold standard to prove effectiveness in a weight-loss plan. But smoothie-based plans beat that number consistently. In a study at the University of Kentucky in 2009, patients were asked to drink at least 3 smoothies a day. After 18 weeks, the subjects lost an average of 16.4 percent of their body weight—up to 44 pounds!
When researchers at Columbia University crunched the numbers on six separate studies following dieters on either a smoothie-based plan (one or two smoothies a day) or a reduced-calorie plan, they found that both sets lost weight, but those on the smoothie-based plan experienced “significantly greater weight loss” at both the 3-month and 1-year marks. In a 2015 review of studies on weight-loss plans, researchers at Johns Hopkins reported that participants who used low-calorie meal-replacement drinks like smoothies lost more weight than other dieters over the course of 4 to 6 months.
Are you ready to make the magic work for you?
 

I’ve been amazed and gratified at how Zero Belly has changed the lives of thousands of Americans. Before going on the plan, Jennie Joshi would avoid walking past the full-length mirror in her Morristown, NJ home. “I hated the way I looked. I wanted to see the old me,” says the mother of two.
Anyone who has had a child knows that feeling and how difficult it can be to lose pregnancy weight. A University of Chicago study last year found that 75 percent of moms were heavier than they were pre- pregnancy a year after giving birth and 45 percent had retained more than 10 pounds.
A high-risk pregnancy made it impossible for Joshi to exercise; she even had to limit her walking. Her weight gain was more than she had expected, and she struggled to lose it. “I really wanted to get rid of my belly,” she says. But the calorie-cutting diet programs weren’t doing it for her; then she learned about the and signed up as one of the program’s first test panelists. She was drawn to its no-sacrifice approach: “I loved that I could just focus on eating healthy foods and not worry about controlling portions.”
She says the healthy recipes in the book made the difference because they included family-friendly options that even a foodie like her husband would enjoy. “Unlike a fad diet that you do once and stop, it’s a lifestyle that’s easy to make your own,” she says.
Joshi also followed the program’s suggested workouts and mixed in some running, spinning, and Zumba. In just four weeks, she lost 11 pounds.
“I saw the pregnancy pooch leaving,” she says, and she pressed on, eventually dropping 26 pounds and fitting into a size 4 dress.
Her co-workers were astonished. “They wanted to know what I was doing.”
What she was doing was drinking Zero Belly Smoothies.
 

One of the key components in Zero Belly Smoothies is the veggie protein powder and use of nut or dairy-free milks. Unless you’ve been living in an igloo for the past two decades, you should know by now that Americans do not eat enough fruits and vegetables. In fact, recent surveys have found that only about 30 percent of Americans are eating the recommended 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day. That’s a pretty pitiful performance and no doubt a partial cause of the obesity epidemic that grips this nation.
Another cause: Over the years, the line between smoothie and milkshake has been irrevocably blurred by the beverage industry. What was once a reliable, all-fruit concoction is now likely to be an ice-cream-and-added-sugar extravaganza, capable of carrying over 2,000 calories a serving (see Smoothie King, Hulk).
If you happen to be one of those 7 out of 10 of us who don’t eat enough plant matter, then you need to make fast friends with Zero Belly Smoothies. They’re the quickest, most delicious way to make up for the fruit-and-vegetable deficit, no ice cream required: Roll out of bed, toss some fruit in a blender, top with a bit of liquid, hit “liquefy.” Boom! You’re on the path to a skinnier, healthier you!
 
 


 
Try the smoothie that ABC News correspondent Dan Harris called “dazzling!” Consider using wild blueberries (you can find them in the freezer section); they’re higher in just about every nutrient than conventional blueberries.

A heartbreakingly honest, endearing memoir of incredible weight loss by a young food blogger who battles body image issues and overcomes food addiction to find self-acceptance.
 
All her life, Andie Mitchell had eaten lustily and mindlessly. Food was her babysitter, her best friend, her confidant, and it provided a refuge from her fractured family. But when she stepped on the scale on her twentieth birthday and it registered a shocking 268 pounds, she knew she had to change the way she thought about food and herself; that her life was at stake.

It Was Me All Along takes Andie from working class Boston to the romantic streets of Rome, from morbidly obese to half her size, from seeking comfort in anything that came cream-filled and two-to-a-pack to finding balance in exquisite (but modest) bowls of handmade pasta. This story is about much more than a woman who loves food and abhors her body. It is about someone who made changes when her situation seemed too far gone and how she discovered balance in an off-kilter world. More than anything, though, it is the story of her finding beauty in acceptance and learning to love all parts of herself.",27559,"Review
“Andie Mitchell draws you in from the first cupcake—you taste the creamy frosting, feel every hunger pang, and your heart aches right along with hers. She beautifully exposes the dark and painful struggles of weight loss, food addiction, and self-hate that so many in this country face. Her journey to mental and physical health—the long road to overcoming her obsessive behavior—is so relatable you can’t help but love and cheer for her. Read this book because it offers wonderful lessons for healthy living, being kind to yourself, and finding balance. Read it because it's heartbreakingly honest and endearingly educational. Just READ IT!”

“Andie's story, in which she takes us along for her 135-pound weight loss journey and makes peace with food, is remarkable. She chooses to see the positives from her past, and she realizes that who she was when she was bigger molded her into the person she is today. Andie is an inspiration to anyone who struggles with the challenges of dieting and weight loss.”
—Gina Homolka, author of The Skinnytaste Cookbook

 “A charming memoir about weight loss and self-discovery.”

Stephanie Laska lost 140 pounds, roughly half of her body weight, by following a ketogenic inspired diet. She figured out the secret to losing weight without the crazy restrictions of a traditional keto diet by following a “dirty” and “lazy” version of keto.

Stephanie spent most of her adult life in the Morbidly Obese Class III BMI category. Hovering close to 300 pounds, she avoided booths at restaurants and feared not fitting into amusement park rides. “I once put my jacket over my lap so the flight attendant wouldn’t see that my seatbelt wouldn’t close,” she admits.

It wasn’t until a friend suggested she could continue to drink beer while still losing weight that Stephanie decided to “try one last time”. Any diet that included loopholes for having a cold beer might be worth a try, she reflected.

Through trial and error, Stephanie learned how eating a low carb, moderate protein, higher fat diet could finally nudge her weight in the right direction. “This is the weirdest diet ever!” went through her mind every time she got on the scale. Coming from an era of eating Fruit Loops washed down with a pitcher of Kool-Aid, Stephanie was clueless about the metabolic effects of consuming too many carbohydrates.

DIRTY, LAZY, KETO explains the unique diet Stephanie followed to achieve her success. Using humor and simple explanations, Stephanie walks the reader through her personal manifesto for weight loss and maintenance. This beginner's guide is chock full of helpful strategies and food lists for you to immediately employ.

Stephanie has kept her weight off for six years. She left behind a giant dent on the couch to run twelve marathons, two of which earned her a first-place marathon medal. As part of the elite “Clean Start Team”, Stephanie even ran the New York City Marathon in 2017 as a sponsored athlete for PowerBar. Her story even appeared in the international publication, Muscle and Fitness: HERS, Spring 2018. More recently, Costco Connection shared Stephanie's story in an article about the merits of an anti-inflammatory diet (January 2019). She is quoted in a Reader's Digest article about foods to avoid while on the keto diet (January 2019) and defends the dirty keto lifestyle in an online Playboy interview (May 2019). You might have even seen Stephanie’s bikini photo (summer 2019) in First for Women Magazine, worldwide!

Stephanie's hope is that the reader will leave inspired and armed with enough information to get started on their own journey of personalized weight loss success.

Let’s discuss the goals of this down and dirty mini-guide. By the end, the reader will be able to:

Partner with your physician to set realistic goals based on your current health
Understand the difference between a DIRTY, LAZY, KETO diet and a Strict Keto Diet
Accurately read a nutrition label and count the net carbs per serving
Confidently shop for ingredients that you need to be successful
Stock your fridge and pantry with appropriate foods for cooking and snacking
Prepare quick and easy meals, drinks, snacks, and desserts that are on plan
Strategize ways to prevent dehydration
Recognize and stop efforts at self-sabotage

Given this, many people suffering from these conditions have searched for alternatives using nutrition and lifestyle changes. In The Autoimmune Paleo Cookbook, Mickey Trescott provides a resource for those looking to embark on the Autoimmune Protocol--a version of an ancestral diet that is focused both on removing potential food triggers as well as healing the gut. Research shows there is a clear connection between diet and autoimmune disease, and many, including the author, have used these principles to heal their bodies from these debilitating conditions and their accompanying symptoms. With the information and recipes in this book, you can embark on this process for yourself--without suffering through bland and tasteless ""allergen-free"" meals. Instead, with all of the incredible food you will be enjoying, you may forget that you are achieving better wellness!
       In the first section of the book, you will learn all about the Autoimmune Protocol--what it is, why it works, and which foods you should eat and avoid while on the elimination diet. Instructions are given on how to clear your pantry of questionable ingredients and replace them with healing, nutrient-dense whole foods. Also included are sections on food quality, a shopping guide, tips and tricks to make the protocol go more smoothly, as well as ideas for batch-cooking and breakfast. Mickey provides two, 4-week meal plans, each of them corresponding with recipes from the book and featuring detailed shopping lists. Armed with this information, anyone can integrate the Autoimmune Protocol in to their routine!
       In addition to the introductory material, The Autoimmune Paleo Cookbook includes 112 delicious recipes suitable for anyone on the strictest phase of the Autoimmune Protocol--no grains, beans, dairy, eggs, nuts, seeds, or nightshades. Although this is quite the list of exclusions, Mickey offers unique, flavorful, and delicious meals suitable for a variety of occasions and preferences. You will find simple recipes that anyone can make for a weeknight dinner, as well as more elaborate preparations for those who want to enjoy with company or for a special occasion. Full-page photos for every recipe show you what to expect and inspire you to create beautiful meals of your own.

Ruth Yaron cares deeply about what your baby is eating--so much so that her bestselling Super Baby Food is encyclopedic in both scope and size. Ounce for hefty ounce, this manual/cookbook/reference guide is worth its weight in formula, packed as it is with detailed information on homemade baby food, nutritional data, feeding schedules, cooking techniques, recipes, and other invaluable feeding tips. Yaron builds her compelling argument for making baby food at home on the simple premise that food profoundly impacts health, especially when an infant's developing digestive tract is involved. Parents will learn why babies should start out on rice porridge, bananas, avocados, and sweet potatoes before advancing to more difficult-to-digest foods such as wheat cereals and milk products. While Yaron's passionate stance and vegetarian bias may turn off some parents, others will be grateful for her strict attention to potentially harmful additives and chemicals. No matter what their eating philosophy, most parents will appreciate the economy and surprising ease of making baby food at home. This is not gourmet cooking; all you have to do is learn how to boil water and operate a blender. For veggies, simply steam some vegetable chunks and blend. For baby porridge, just grind some whole grains in a blender and boil. It's that simple. And when you're feeding your baby, simple is best. --Sumi Hahn

From beer to Coca-Cola, the six drinks that have helped shape human history.
Throughout human history, certain drinks have done much more than just quench thirst. As Tom Standage relates with authority and charm, six of them have had a surprisingly pervasive influence on the course of history, becoming the defining drink during a pivotal historical period.
A History of the World in 6 Glasses tells the story of humanity from the Stone Age to the 21st century through the lens of beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and cola. Beer was first made in the Fertile Crescent and by 3000 B.C.E. was so important to Mesopotamia and Egypt that it was used to pay wages. In ancient Greece wine became the main export of her vast seaborne trade, helping spread Greek culture abroad. Spirits such as brandy and rum fueled the Age of Exploration, fortifying seamen on long voyages and oiling the pernicious slave trade. Although coffee originated in the Arab world, it stoked revolutionary thought in Europe during the Age of Reason, when coffeehouses became centers of intellectual exchange. And hundreds of years after the Chinese began drinking tea, it became especially popular in Britain, with far-reaching effects on British foreign policy. Finally, though carbonated drinks were invented in 18th-century Europe they became a 20th-century phenomenon, and Coca-Cola in particular is the leading symbol of globalization.
For Tom Standage, each drink is a kind of technology, a catalyst for advancing culture by which he demonstrates the intricate interplay of different civilizations. You may never look at your favorite drink the same way again.",5632,"Review
“[A HISTORY OF THE WORLD IN 6 GLASSES] is loaded with the kind of data that get talked about at the figurative water cooler...Incisive, illuminating and swift.” ―Janet Maslin, The New York Times

Desert Solitaire is a collection of vignettes about life in the wilderness and the nature of the desert itself by park ranger and conservationist, Edward Abbey. The book details the unique adventures and conflicts the author faces, from dealing with the damage caused by development of the land or excessive tourism, to discovering a dead body. However Desert Solitaire is not just a collection of one man’s stories, the book is also a philosophical memoir, full of Abbey’s reflections on the desert as a paradox, at once beautiful and liberating, but also isolating and cruel. Often compared to Thoreau’s Walden, Desert Solitaire is a powerful discussion of life’s mysteries set against the stirring backdrop of the American southwestern wilderness.",6198,"Amazon.com Review
Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire, the noted author's most enduring nonfiction work, is an account of Abbey's seasons as a ranger at Arches National Park outside Moab, Utah. Abbey reflects on the nature of the Colorado Plateau desert, on the condition of our remaining wilderness, and on the future of a civilization that cannot reconcile itself to living in the natural world. He also recounts adventures with scorpions and snakes, obstinate tourists and entrenched bureaucrats, and, most powerful of all, with his own mortality. Abbey's account of getting stranded in a rock pool down a side branch of the Grand Canyon is at once hilarious and terrifying.

But this book is different from all the others.
Becoming Steve Jobs takes on and breaks down the existing myth and stereotypes about Steve Jobs. The conventional, one-dimensional view of Jobs is that he was half genius, half jerk from youth, an irascible and selfish leader who slighted friends and family alike. Becoming Steve Jobs answers the central question about the life and career of the Apple cofounder and CEO: How did a young man so reckless and arrogant that he was exiled from the company he founded become the most effective visionary business leader of our time, ultimately transforming the daily lives of billions of people?
Drawing on incredible and sometimes exclusive access, Schlender and Tetzeli tell a different story of a real human being who wrestled with his failings and learned to maximize his strengths over time. Their rich, compelling narrative is filled with stories never told before from the people who knew Jobs best and who decided to open up to the authors, including his family, former inner circle executives, and top people at Apple, Pixar, and Disney. In addition Brent knew Jobs personally for 25 years and drew upon his many interviews with him, on and off the record, in writing the book. He and Rick humanize the man and explain, rather than simply describe, his behavior. Along the way the book provides rich context about the technology revolution we all have lived through and the ways in which Jobs changed our world.
Schlender and Tetzeli make clear that Jobs' astounding success at Apple was far more complicated than simply picking the right products: he became more patient, he learned to trust his inner circle, and he discovered the importance of growing the company incrementally rather than only shooting for dazzling, game-changing products.",,,,"['walter isaacson', 'becoming steve', 'isaacson book', 'brent schlender', 'isaacson biography', 'well written', 'tim cook', 'highly recommend', 'rick tetzeli', 'much better', 'bill gates', 'silicon valley', 'schlender and rick', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Based on the most comprehensive nutrition study ever conducted, the book reveals that a plant-based diet leads to optimal health with the power to halt or reverse many diseases.

The China Study Cookbook takes these scientific findings and puts them to action. Written by LeAnne Campbell, daughter of The China Study author T. Colin Campbell, PhD, and mother of two hungry teenagers, The China Study Cookbook features delicious, easily prepared plant-based recipes with no added fat and minimal sugar and salt that promote optimal health.

From her Breakfast Home-Fry Hash and Fabulous Sweet Potato Enchiladas to No-Bake Peanut Butter Bars and Cheese(less) Cake, all of LeAnne’s recipes follow three important principles:

1. Optimal nutrition is based on eating food rather than nutrient supplements
2. The closer that foods are to their native states—prepared with minimal cooking, salting, and processing—the greater the long-term health benefits of eating them
3. It is best to choose locally and organically grown produce whenever possible

With 140 healthy, family-friendly recipes, 120 full-color photos, nutritional information for every recipe, and Gina's signature cooking tips, Skinnytaste One and Done will be a weeknight game changer. Even if you don't own all of the appliances, Gina gives alternative cooking directions using everyday cooking equipment where possible, so you won't miss out.

""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a home cook in possession of an Instant Pot must be in want of a cookbook filled with delicious ways to use it. The creator behind the wildly popular blog Skinnytaste took that idea and ran with it, including chapters on sheet pan, Dutch oven, skillet, slow cooker, and air fryer ideas for the calorie-minded cook.""
-- The Kitchn

""The best-selling author and blogger behind Skinnytaste, Gina Homolka, is back with a new cookbook, and this one features entirely one-vessel meals. Sometimes that vessel is the sheet-pan, sometimes it's the slow cooker, and other times it's the multi-cooker (aka Instant Pot). Whatever vessel you're using, these recipes promise to be doable and, of course, healthy.""
-- Epicurious

""With delectable options for almost every dietary preference (the Veggie-Filled Zucchini Noodles are going on our menu ASAP), this will be a family-friendly cookbook you reach for again and again."" 
-- MindBodyGreen

""Sheet-pan dinners? Check. Skillet meals? Check. Air-fryer recipes? Check, check, check. The founder of the popular blog skinnytaste.com certainly knows the way straight to our heart: Easy recipes, low calories and easy cleanup.""

The trailblazing film Forks Over Knives helped spark a medical and nutritional revolution. Backed by scientific research, the film’s doctors and expert researchers made a radical but convincing case that modern diseases can be prevented and often reversed by leaving meat, dairy, and highly refined foods off the plate and adopting a whole-food, plant-based diet instead.

Now, The Forks Over Knives Plan shows you how to put this life-saving, delicious diet into practice in your own life. This easy-to-follow, meal-by-meal makeover is the approach Doctors Alona Pulde and Matthew Lederman (featured in the documentary) use every day in their nutritional health practice—a simple plan that focuses on hearty comfort foods and does not involve portion control or worrying about obtaining single nutrients like protein and calcium.

In just four short weeks you’ll learn how to stock your refrigerator, plan meals, combat cravings, and discover all the tips and tricks you’ll need to eat on the go and snack healthily. You’ll also get 100 simple, tasty recipes to keep you on the right track, beautiful photographs, a 28-day eating guide, and advice throughout the book from people just like you.

Whether you’re already a convert and just want a dietary reboot, or you’re trying a plant-based diet for the first time, The Forks Over Knives Plan makes it easier than ever to transition to this healthiest way of eating…and to maintain it for life.",1005,"Review

“I ate and ate and ate in the hopes that if I made myself big, my body would be safe. I buried the girl I was because she ran into all kinds of trouble. I tried to erase every memory of her, but she is still there, somewhere. . . . I was trapped in my body, one that I barely recognized or understood, but at least I was safe.”
In her phenomenally popular essays and long-running Tumblr blog, Roxane Gay has written with intimacy and sensitivity about food and body, using her own emotional and psychological struggles as a means of exploring our shared anxieties over pleasure, consumption, appearance, and health. As a woman who describes her own body as “wildly undisciplined,” Roxane understands the tension between desire and denial, between self-comfort and self-care. In Hunger, she explores her past—including the devastating act of violence that acted as a turning point in her young life—and brings readers along on her journey to understand and ultimately save herself.
With the bracing candor, vulnerability, and power that have made her one of the most admired writers of her generation, Roxane explores what it means to learn to take care of yourself: how to feed your hungers for delicious and satisfying food, a smaller and safer body, and a body that can love and be loved—in a time when the bigger you are, the smaller your world becomes.",10037,"Review
“A work of staggering honesty . . . . Poignantly told.” (New Republic)

“The book’s short, sharp chapters come alive in vivid personal anecdotes. . . . And on nearly every page, Gay’s raw, powerful prose plants a flag, facing down decades of shame and self-loathing by reclaiming the body she never should have had to lose.” (Entertainment Weekly)

“Bracingly vivid. . . . Remarkable. . . . Undestroyed, unruly, unfettered, Ms. Gay, live your life. We are all better for having you do so in the same ferociously honest fashion that you have written this book.” (Los Angeles Times)

“Searing, smart, readable. . . . “Hunger,” like Ta-Nehisi Coates’ “Between the World and Me,” interrogates the fortunes of black bodies in public spaces. . . .  Nothing seems gratuitous; a lot seems brave. There is an incantatory element of repetition to “Hunger”: The very short chapters scallop over the reader like waves.” (Newsday)

“Luminous. . . . intellectually rigorous and deeply moving.” (The New York Times Book Review)

“Her spare prose, written with a raw grace, heightens the emotional resonance of her story, making each observation sharper, each revelation more riveting. . . . It is a thing of raw beauty.” (USA Today)

“Powerful. . . . fierce. . . . Gay has a vivid, telegraphic writing style, which serves her well. Repetitive and recursive, it propels the reader forward with unstoppable force.” (Lisa Ko, author of The Leavers)

“This is the book to read this summer . . . she’s such a compelling mind . . . . Anyone who has a body should read this book.” (Isaac Fitzgerald on the Today show)

“is Gay at her most lacerating and probing. . . . Anyone familiar with
Gay’s books or tweets knows she also wields a dagger-sharp wit.”

“Wrenching, deeply moving. . . a memoir that’s so brave, so raw, it feels as if [Gay]’s entrusting you with her soul.” ()

Phinney, Jeff S. Volek",4.6,656,,13.46,,"Carbohydrate restricted diets are commonly practiced but seldom taught. As a result, doctors, dietitians, nutritionists, and nurses may have strong opinions about low carbohydrate dieting, but in many if not most cases, these views are not grounded in science. Now, whether you are a curious healthcare professional or just a connoisseur of diet information, two New York Times best selling authors provide you with the definitive resource for low carbohydrate living. Doctors Volek and Phinney share over 50 years of clinical experience using low carbohydrate diets, and together they have published more than 200 research papers and chapters on the topic. Particularly in the last decade, much has been learned about the risks associated with insulin resistance (including but not limited to metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and type-2 diabetes), and how this condition is far better controlled by carbohydrate restriction than with drugs. In this book, you will learn why: • Carbohydrate restriction is the proverbial ‘silver bullet’ for managing insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and type-2 diabetes. • Restricting carbohydrate improves blood glucose and lipids while reducing inflammation, all without drugs. • Dietary saturated fat is not a demon when you are low carb adapted. • Dietary sugars and refined starches are not needed to feed your brain or fuel exercise. • Long-term success involves much more than simply cutting out carbs. • Electrolyte and mineral management are key to avoiding side effects and ensuring success. • Trading up from sugars and starches to a cornucopia of nutrient-rich, satisfying, and healthy foods is empowering. • Studying hunter-gathers’ diets provides clues to how best formulate a low carbohydrate diet. This is a great book for health-minded individuals. It is an excellent book for healthcare professionals. Best of all, it is the perfect gift for health-minded individuals to share with their doctors, dietitians, and nutritionists.",9454,,"About the Author

And the prescription is simple: By doctoring up packaged cake mix with just the right extras--a touch of sweet butter here, cocoa powder there, or poppy seeds, vanilla yogurt, sherry, eggs, and grated lemon zest for the Charleston Poppy Seed Cake--even the least experienced baker can turn out luscious signature desserts, time after time. The proof is in the taste, and the taste never stops--from Toasted Coconut Sour Cream Cake to Devilishly Good Chocolate Cake; from a to-die-for Caramel Cake and a Holiday Yule Log to cheesecakes, coffee cakes, sheet cakes, pound cakes, bars, brownies, and those all-important frostings, here are 175 fast, foolproof recipes that will transform the art of home baking in America.

Who could believe these cakes came out of a box? Moist, tender, rich, deep, and complexly flavored, without a hint of artificiality, each cake stand up and delivers. But without any of the fuss of baking from scratch. Anne Byrn, an award-wining food writer and self-described purist, creates recipes that employ a cake mix's strengths---convenience, ease-of-use, dependability, and almost imperviousness to overbeating, underbeating, overbaking, and underbaking.

In addition to the recipes are the Cake Mix Doctor's Q&A's, extensive ""Doctor Says"" tips, lists--15 Beautiful Birthday Cakes, 15 Cakes That Will Cash in at a Bake Sale--and more, all illustrated in a full-color photographic insert.",17279,"Amazon.com Review
Cake mixes are undoubtedly convenient, but do they produce good cakes? They can, says Anne Byrn, author of The Cake Mix Doctor, if you know how to tweak them. Doing this involves the addition of ingredients to enrich the mixes and flavorings to enhance and, in some cases, conceal questionable tastes. To prove her point, Byrn offers more than 175 recipes for mix-based cakes and other desserts, including formulas for frostings that, Byrn maintains, must be made from scratch. The results are convincing; readers interested in satisfying, dependable desserts prepared quickly and with little fuss should welcome the book.
Beginning with a useful discussion of cake mixes, their history and composition, and an outline of the mix-transformation battle plan, the book then presents the recipes in chapters such as ""Chocolate Cakes,"" ""Cake-Mix Classics,"" ""Special Occasion Cakes,"" and ""Incredible Bars and Comforting Cookies."" Among the most successful offerings are Deeply Chocolate Almond Cake with Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting, Banana Cake with Quick Caramel Frosting, and Lemon Buttermilk Poppy Seed Cake. A chapter devoted to crumbles, crisps, cobblers, trifles, and even a dessert pizza shows how to use the mixes in innovative ways, and ""Lighter Cakes"" presents ""healthier"" offerings, such as Pear and Toasted Pecan Buttermilk Cake. With sidebars such as The Legendary Pillsbury Bake-Off and tips for success throughout (""Cinnamon is one of the great tools to use when doctoring up cake mixes,"" begins one), the book explores every aspect of cake-mix fixing while revealing the unexpected richness that the process can yield. --Arthur Boehm

This boxed set brings together Mastering the Art of French Cooking, first published in 1961, and its sequel, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume Two, published in 1970.

Volume One is the classic cookbook, in its entirety—524 recipes.
“Anyone can cook in the French manner anywhere,” wrote Mesdames Beck, Bertholle, and Child, “with the right instruction.” And here is the book that, for nearly fifty years, has been teaching Americans how.

Mastering the Art of French Cooking is for both seasoned cooks and beginners who love good food and long to reproduce at home the savory delights of the classic cuisine, from the historic Gallic masterpieces to the seemingly artless perfection of a dish of spring-green peas. The techniques learned in this beautiful book, with more than one hundred instructive illustrations, can be applied to recipes in all other French cookbooks, making them infinitely usable. In compiling the secrets of famous Cordon Bleu chefs, the authors produced a magnificent volume that continues to have a place of honor in American kitchens.

Volume Two is the sequel to the great cooking classic—with 257 additional recipes. Following the publication of the celebrated Volume One, Julia Child and Simone Beck continued to search out and sample new recipes among the classic dishes and regional specialties of France—cooking, conferring, tasting, revising, perfecting. Out of their discoveries they made, for Volume Two, a brilliant selection of precisely those recipes that not only add to the repertory but, above all, bring the reader to a new level of mastery of the art of French cooking.

Each of these recipes is worked out step-by-step, with the clarity and precision that are the essence of the first volume. Five times as many drawings as in Volume One make the clear instructions even more so.

Perhaps the most remarkable achievement of this volume is that it will make Americans actually more expert than their French contemporaries in two supreme areas of cookery: baking and charcuterie. In France one can turn to the local bakery for fresh and expertly baked bread, or to neighborhood charcuterie for pâtés and terrines and sausages. Here, most of us have no choice but to create them for ourselves.

Praise for Julia Child and Mastering the Art of French Cooking

“Julia Child paved the way for Chez Panisse and so many others by demystifying French food and by reconnecting pleasure and delight with cooking and eating at the table. She brought forth a culture of American ingredients and gave us all the confidence to cook with them in the pursuit of flavor.” —Alice Waters, Chez Panisse

“Mastering the Art of French Cooking was one of my first introductions to my foundation of understanding the art of French cooking. The combination of reading Julia’s book, working in the kitchen, and watching her television shows helped lead me to my beginnings in serious cuisine. Julia is . . . the grande dame of cooking, who has touched all of our lives with her immense respect and appreciation of cuisine.” —Emeril Lagasse, Emeril’s Restaurant

“Julia has slowly but surely altered our way of thinking about food. She has taken the fear out of the term ‘haute cuisine.’ She has increased gastronomic awareness a thousandfold by stressing the importance of good foundation and technique, and she has elevated our consciousness to the refined pleasures of dining. Through the years her shows have kept me in rapt attention, and her humor has kept me in stitches. She is a national treasure, a culinary trendsetter, and a born educator beloved by all.” —Thomas Keller, The French Laundry

“Julia freed the American public from their fears of cooking French. By doing so, she greatly expanded the audience for all serious food writers. Her demystification prepared that public for the rest of us. I believe that the television shows based on that landmark book did even more to encourage reluctant cooks to try their hands . . . much to our benefit.” —Mimi Sheraton

“1961 A.D. Julia Child’s Mastering the Art of French Cooking is published. Her black-and-white TV show on WGBH in Boston soon follows. Child is one of the great teachers of the millennium: She is intelligent and charismatic, and her undistinguished manual skills are not daunting to her viewers. An entire generation of ambitious American home cooks is instantly born.” —Jeffrey Steingarten

Emphatically yes.

And that’s the beauty of being a waffle iron chef―waffling food other than waffles is not just a novelty but an innovation that leads to a great end product, all while giving the cook the bonus pleasure of doing something cool, fun, and vaguely nerdy (or giving a reluctant eater―your child, say―a great reason to dig in). Waffled bacon reaches perfect crispness without burned edges, cooks super fast in the two-sided heat source, and leaves behind just the right amount of fat to waffle some eggs. Waffled Sweet Potato Gnocchi, Pressed Potato and Cheese Pierogi, and Waffled Meatballs all end up with dimples just right for trapping their delicious sauces. A waffle iron turns leftover mac ’n’ cheese into Revitalized Macaroni and Cheese, which is like a decadent version of a grilled cheese sandwich with its golden, buttery, slightly crisp exterior and soft, melty, cheesy interior.",13514,"Review

Lose weight and heal your gut with more than 100 delicious Plant Paradox–approved recipes!
In the New York Times bestseller The Plant Paradox, renowned cardiologist Dr. Steven Gundry introduced readers around the world to the hidden toxins lurking in seemingly “healthy” foods: a class of plant-based proteins known as lectins. Found in nightshade plants like tomatoes and cucumbers, as well as in grains, legumes, and conventional dairy, lectins attack the lining of our gut and disrupt the balance of our microbiome, leading to leaky gut syndrome and widespread inflammation, weight gain, and illness.
Now, in The Plant Paradox Cookbook, Dr. Gundry gives fans of The Plant Paradox what they’ve been asking for: more recipes! In this easy-to-follow cookbook, Dr. Gundry shows readers how simple and delicious it is to live lectin-free (or at least lectin-reduced). In addition to an overview of the Plant Paradox program, a pantry guide, and sample meal plans, Dr. Gundry shares more than one hundred recipes designed to help heal the gut, promote weight loss, and quell inflammation.
He also includes simple kitchen hacks—like peeling and seeding vegetables, and pressure cooking grains and legumes—that reduce or eliminate lectin content, making many favorite foods safe to consume. With dishes that cover every meal of the day, including Pesto-Baked Eggs; Lemon, Kale, and Chicken Soup; Spinach Artichoke Lasagna; and Truffled Mushroom Mac and Cheese, and decadent desserts such as Chocolate Mint Cookies, Pistachio Ice Cream, and Olive Oil Rosemary Cake, Dr. Gundry makes it easy for everyone to clean up their diets and live lectin-free.

Hailed by Time magazine as ""a minor masterpiece"" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious.

For its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment.

On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped birth the inventive culinary movement known as ""molecular gastronomy."" Though other books have been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques.

Among the major themes addressed throughout the new edition are:
· Traditional and modern methods of food production and their influences on food quality
· The great diversity of methods by which people in different places and times have prepared the same ingredients
· Tips for selecting the best ingredients and preparing them successfully
· The particular substances that give foods their flavors, and that give us pleasure
· Our evolving knowledge of the health benefits and risks of foods

On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food.",4730,"From Publishers Weekly
Starred Review. Before antioxidants, extra-virgin olive oil and supermarket sushi commanded public obsession, the first edition of this book swept readers and cooks into the everyday magic of the kitchen: it became an overnight classic. Now, 20 years later, McGee has taken his slightly outdated volume and turned it into a stunning masterpiece that combines science, linguistics, history, poetry and, of course, gastronomy. He dances from the spicy flavor of Hawaiian seaweed to the scientific method of creating no-stir peanut butter, quoting Chinese poet Shu Xi and biblical proverbs along the way. McGee's conversational style—rich with exclamation points and everyday examples—allows him to explain complex chemical reactions, like caramelization, without dumbing them down. His book will also be hailed as groundbreaking in its breakdown of taste and flavor. Though several cookbooks have begun to answer the questions of why certain foods go well together, McGee draws on recent agricultural research, neuroscience reviews and chemical publications to chart the different flavor chemicals in herbs and spices, fruits and vegetables. Odd synergies appear, like the creation of fruity esters in dry-cured ham—the same that occur naturally in melons! McGee also corrects the European bias of the first edition, moving beyond the Mediterranean to discuss the foods of Asia and Mexico. Almost every single page of this edition has been rewritten, but the book retains the same light touch as the original. McGee has successfully revised the bible of food science—and produced a fascinating, charming text.

From Scientific American
""In 1984, canola oil and the computer mouse and compact disc were all novelties... [and] the worlds of science and cooking were neatly compartmentalized."" A lot has changed in 20 years: magazines and books now discuss the science of cooking, and culinary schools offer ""experimental"" courses that investigate the whys of cooking. So McGee, a writer who specializes in the chemistry of food and cooking, has completely rewritten his 1984 classic, expanding it by two thirds into a book that weighs in at almost 900 pages. He offers thorough, scientific explanations of countless topics, including why brining your turkey is not a good idea, why food wrapped in plastic often tastes like plastic, why you should never refrigerate tomatoes. And he continues to display, as one admirer said of the first edition, ""a scientist's skill and a cook's heart.""

""In my lifetime, I've understood diet played a big role in the quality of my life, so I ate what I considered to be good for me. From childhood, the litany of ‘eat your vegetables’ was drummed into me, sometimes literally. Naturally, me being Southern, there was always meat served with those veggies, and most times it was used to flavor them. 64 years later, I meet the Esselstyns, and they say ‘eat your vegetables, but eat them raw or cooked with no oil!’ WHAT?! But, I tried it. It's truly amazing what the things I already liked really tasted like. Even more amazing: the number of plant-based creations that are possible. I won't go into the gigantic health benefits that came my way as a result of my decision to go plant-based, but I will say that 30 lost pounds and an infinite number of compliments later, I'm more than happy. I hope you'll treat yourself to one of these recipes and just open that door. I guarantee you won't close it!""

Praise for Caldwell Esselstyn's Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease
“Proves that changes in diet (and that alone) cause radical changes in the age and disease of your arteries.”
—Michael Roizen, M.D., coauthor of You: On a Diet

“Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn has directed pioneering research demonstrating that the progression of even severe coronary heart disease can often be reversed by making comprehensive changes in diet and lifestyle.”


“A hard-nosed scientist shows us his secrets for successfully cleaning the rusting arteries of so many patients—and it doesn’t even hurt.”


“Dr. Esselstyn has always been ahead of his time. His focus on the healing powers of proper nutrition on diseased coronary arteries has now proven right, raising another unthinkable notion—that heart patients can cure themselves.”


“This powerful program will make you virtually heart-attack-proof. On the basis of decades of research, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn has shown not only how to prevent heart disease but also how to reverse it—even for people who have been affected for many years. I strongly recommend this important book.”


“Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease provides a practical approach for people to regain their lost health. Considering the worldwide prevalence of coronary artery disease, this book should become the bestseller of all time.”


“Dr. Esselstyn’s eminently successful arrest-and-reversal therapy for heart disease through patient education and empowerment as the treatment of choice will send shock waves through a mercenary medical system that focuses largely on pills and procedures.”


“Dr. Esselstyn’s solution in Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease is as profound as Newton’s discovery of gravity. Half of all Americans dying today could have changed their date with the undertaker by following Dr. Esselstyn’s plan.”


“If you have heart disease, this book should be essential reading. It could save your life.”

ROASTED RUTABAGA WEDGES

Makes enough for 4 people

This recipe is inspired by a band that used to play at a local dive bar in one of our old neighborhoods. No, they weren't called the Roasted Rutabagas, but they were just as underrated.

6 fist-size rutabagas*
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 lemon
1 tablespoon fresh thyme

1 Crank your oven up to 425°F. Pull out a baking sheet.

2 Cut the ends off the rutabagas cause those are tough and you don't want that shit, then cut the rutabagas into thick wedges and add them to a large bowl. Add the oil, salt, and garlic powder and toss together.

3 Pour those onto the baking sheet, stick them into the oven, and roast until you can stick a fork through them and they look browned in some spots, about 35 minutes.

4 Squeeze over the lemon juice, sprinkle with thyme, and serve those rooty bastards warm.

*If you can't find rutabagas where you're at, use potatoes or another root veggie that's just as goddamn delicious.

Did you know that eating oatmeal actually isn't a healthy way to start the day? That milk doesn't build bones, and eggs aren't the devil?

Even the most health conscious among us have a hard time figuring out what to eat in order to lose weight, stay fit, and improve our health. And who can blame us? When it comes to diet, there's so much changing and conflicting information flying around that it's impossible to know where to look for sound advice. And decades of misguided ""common sense,"" food-industry lobbying, bad science, and corrupt food polices and guidelines have only deepened our crisis of nutritional confusion, leaving us overwhelmed and anxious when we head to the grocery store.

Thankfully, bestselling author Dr. Mark Hyman is here to set the record straight. In Food: What the Heck Should I Eat? -- his most comprehensive book yet -- he takes a close look at every food group and explains what we've gotten wrong, revealing which foods nurture our health and which pose a threat. From grains to legumes, meat to dairy, fats to artificial sweeteners, and beyond, Dr. Hyman debunks misconceptions and breaks down the fascinating science in his signature accessible style. He also explains food's role as powerful medicine capable of reversing chronic disease and shows how our food system and policies impact the environment, the economy, social justice, and personal health, painting a holistic picture of growing, cooking, and eating food in ways that nourish our bodies and the earth while creating a healthy society.

We must get a little healthier now or the cost of health care will sink our economy in the not too distant future. This practical book could not have come at a better time.""―Congressman Tim Ryan, Ohio, author of The Real Food Revolution

""Just about every time someone leaves the doctor's office, they are told to exercise and eat well. Sadly, at this point in our collective human history, there is still not wide consensus on how to do either properly. With nutrition in particular, it feels like near daily whiplash. Yesterday coconut oil seemed a panacea, by tomorrow you may hear it causes heart disease. Dr. Mark Hyman, who has diligently dedicated his life to wellness, has a new book that may offer some much-needed relief. Food goes between the lines of nutrition research, providing a clear roadmap for the confused eater.""―Sanjay Gupta, MD


""Dr. Hyman eloquently answers what may well be the most important question we all ask ourselves every day. Food brings the very best in nutritional science to a place of clarity and implementation for everyone.""
―--David Perlmutter, MD, author of Grain Brain and Brain Maker

""Mark Hyman knows as much about food and our health as any human being alive. His new book, Food, is an invaluable guide to what we should eat and, perhaps more importantly, what we shouldn't, to get healthy and stay healthy.""
―Gary Taubes, author of The Case Against Sugar

""Finally, a book that puts common sense and integrity back into the discussion about what to eat -- despite decades of being fed a steady diet of nonsense by so-called 'trusted authorities.' Bravo, Dr. Hyman. this book is good medicine.""―


""Food has turned out to be a much more powerful medicine than we were all taught, yet for so many of us, the many different diets available paint a confusing picture. In his new book, Dr. Mark Hyman has provided exactly what we need: an expert analysis, clear-headed description, and effective solution to what the heck we should all be eating to optimize our health and longevity. This may be the most important book you read on this critical topic, and Dr. Hyman is one of the precious few with both the expertise and writing skill to make this information available and digestible.""―


""In a world of increasing dietary anxiety, Dr. Hyman offers a roadmap to respecting food as medicine.""―

""In the diet wars, no battle is more contentious than low-fat vegan versus high-fat paleo. Mark Hyman finds common ground with paleo-vegan ('Pegan'), a plant-based diet supplemented moderately with animal foods (as 'condi-meat'). offers a delicious recipe for restoring our health, as we care for the planet.""
―

""Food and the way we produce and consume it is at the center of most of our world's health, environmental, climate, economic, and even political crises. With his new book, ,Mark Hyman, MD, shows us that food is powerful medicine, and it contains information that speaks to our environment and our genes, programming our body with messages of health or illness.""―


""Food is at the center of our well-being, and how we get our food is directly connected to the health of our planet. But we're drowning in bewildering information and advice about what to eat. In his new book, , Mark Hyman, MD, breaks down all the science into practical advice about what to eat and what to avoid. This is a manual for how the food we eat can help us thrive.""―

R. Martin (Foreword)",4.8,626,16.99,,23.99,"Ever wonder what it’s like to attend a feast at Winterfell? Wish you could split a lemon cake with Sansa Stark, scarf down a pork pie with the Night’s Watch, or indulge in honeyfingers with Daenerys Targaryen? George R. R. Martin’s bestselling saga A Song of Ice and Fire and the runaway hit HBO series Game of Thrones are renowned for bringing Westeros’s sights and sounds to vivid life. But one important ingredient has always been missing: the mouthwatering dishes that form the backdrop of this extraordinary world. Now, fresh out of the series that redefined fantasy, comes the cookbook that may just redefine dinner . . . and lunch, and breakfast.
 
A passion project from superfans and amateur chefs Chelsea Monroe-Cassel and Sariann Lehrer—and endorsed by George R. R. Martin himself—A Feast of Ice and Fire lovingly replicates a stunning range of cuisines from across the Seven Kingdoms and beyond. From the sumptuous delicacies enjoyed in the halls of power at King’s Landing, to the warm and smoky comfort foods of the frozen North, to the rich, exotic fare of the mysterious lands east of Westeros, there’s a flavor for every palate, and a treat for every chef.
 
These easy-to-follow recipes have been refined for modern cooking techniques, but adventurous eaters can also attempt the authentic medieval meals that inspired them. The authors have also suggested substitutions for some of the more fantastical ingredients, so you won’t have to stock your kitchen with camel, live doves, or dragon eggs to create meals fit for a king (or a khaleesi). In all, A Feast of Ice and Fire contains more than 100 recipes, divided by region:
 
• The Wall: Rack of Lamb and Herbs; Pork Pie; Mutton in Onion-Ale Broth; Mulled Wine; Pease Porridge
• The North: Beef and Bacon Pie; Honeyed Chicken; Aurochs with Roasted Leeks; Baked Apples
• The South: Cream Swans; Trout Wrapped in Bacon; Stewed Rabbit; Sister’s Stew; Blueberry Tarts
• King’s Landing: Lemon Cakes; Quails Drowned in Butter; Almond Crusted Trout; Bowls of Brown; Iced Milk with Honey
• Dorne: Stuffed Grape Leaves; Duck with Lemons; Chickpea Paste
• Across the Narrow Sea: Biscuits and Bacon; Tyroshi Honeyfingers; Wintercakes; Honey-Spiced Locusts
 
There’s even a guide to dining and entertaining in the style of the Seven Kingdoms. Exhaustively researched and reverently detailed, accompanied by passages from all five books in the series and full-color photographs guaranteed to whet your appetite, this is the companion to the blockbuster phenomenon that millions of stomachs have been growling for. And remember, winter is coming—so don’t be afraid to put on a few pounds.

Includes a Foreword by George R. R. Martin",8065,"Review
""The combination of headnotes and recipes [in A Feast of Ice and Fire] almost reaches the Elizabeth David level of 'put down this book, get out of bed and start cooking.' ... And with their adherence to the imagined geography of Westeros, the authors also might actually outdo Alice Waters in local and seasonal cooking."" -Newsweek

Evicted meets Nickel and Dimed in Stephanie Land's memoir about working as a maid, a beautiful and gritty exploration of poverty in America. Includes a foreword by Barbara Ehrenreich.

At 28, Stephanie Land's plans of breaking free from the roots of her hometown in the Pacific Northwest to chase her dreams of attending a university and becoming a writer, were cut short when a summer fling turned into an unexpected pregnancy. She turned to housekeeping to make ends meet, and with a tenacious grip on her dream to provide her daughter the very best life possible, Stephanie worked days and took classes online to earn a college degree, and began to write relentlessly.

She wrote the true stories that weren't being told: the stories of overworked and underpaid Americans. Of living on food stamps and WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) coupons to eat. Of the government programs that provided her housing, but that doubled as halfway houses. The aloof government employees who called her lucky for receiving assistance while she didn't feel lucky at all. She wrote to remember the fight, to eventually cut through the deep-rooted stigmas of the working poor.

Maid explores the underbelly of upper-middle class America and the reality of what it's like to be in service to them. ""I'd become a nameless ghost,"" Stephanie writes about her relationship with her clients, many of whom do not know her from any other cleaner, but who she learns plenty about. As she begins to discover more about her clients' lives-their sadness and love, too-she begins to find hope in her own path.

Her compassionate, unflinching writing as a journalist gives voice to the ""servant"" worker, and those pursuing the American Dream from below the poverty line. Maid is Stephanie's story, but it's not her alone. It is an inspiring testament to the strength, determination, and ultimate triumph of the human spirit.",6602,"Amazon.com Review
An Amazon Best Book of January 2019: Stephanie Land lifts the rug on the life of the working poor in her eye-opening book, Maid. She is writing about the people who clean our homes, who tend to our yards—yet so often these workers go unseen and their stories untold. As a single mother, Stephanie Land cares for herself and her young daughter through a complicated system of government assistance programs and through employment as a house cleaner. Her experience with government aid programs magnifies their worst inconsistency: how difficult is it for people to become self-sufficient when they are reliant on child care and food assistance credit in order to work and live, yet even the smallest increase in income can mean a significant loss of benefits. Land doesn’t have family or friends who could help her financially. They just don’t have it to give. She is truly on her own, yet using a food assistance card at the grocery store checkout has earned her scorn and judgement from strangers who think anyone using the system is abusing the system. Land is a fighter—her desire to create a better life for her daughter is what drives her to keep trying to dig her way out of poverty, working long hours for low pay, and grasping what kindnesses she receives like a life line. Maid is compelling because it’s so personal. Land isn’t whining or blaming, she’s letting us into her life, sharing feelings of inadequacy, loneliness, and desperation that come with trying so damn hard to do better and still living below the poverty line in spite of her efforts. Land has a hard life but she also has hope and resilience. She finds joy in small moments that are often overlooked in the distraction of material things. Maid is an important work of journalism that offers an insightful and unique perspective on a segment of the working poor from someone who has lived it. --Seira Wilson, Amazon Book Review

Indian Spice Meets American Speed in 'Vegan Richa's Indian Kitchen' -- Huffington Post.

""One of the Best Vegan Cookbooks of 2015"" - Vegetarian Times


There are no shortage of Indian cookbooks published, but this one bests them all. There is so much more to Indian food than Butter Chicken. Choose your own flavor explosion! The photos in the book are stunning. The recipes are weeknight friendly. -- T.O.F.U. Magazine. 

Exotic and richly developed, Richa's plant-based, spiced Indian recipes are neither too complicated nor made with ingredients too obscure to find, to make them unapproachable for the home cook. Complex flavors and textures, hallmarks of Indian cuisine, are the big draw to the 150 recipes in this book, but so, is the photography. -- Bluffton Today.


Once in a while, a food blogger comes along who goes the extra mile or 70. Richa combines a respect for tradition with a modern cook's pragmatism and in doing so, many recipes trade painstaking effort and hours in the kitchen for much more convenience without sacrificing the most important detail: fantastic food. -- Marla Rose, Vegan Street.

I love this cookbook because it displays an array of whole, plant-based foods that are truly nutritious, combining grains and legumes with a wide variety of vegetables, while offering ridiculously delicious dishes with aromas that will totally keep you hooked. Each recipe indicates whether it is, or could be made soy-free, gluten-free, and nut-free - and that includes the breads!

From the Author
You may already love Indian food. Now imagine being able to cook your favorite recipes in your own kitchen. From delicious Dals to restaurant-style sauces, flat breads, savory breakfasts, snacks, and much more. How about some unique Indian desserts? Who would have thought you could one day enjoy dairy-free rasmalai, sandesh, or gulab jamun?  Now you can. This book is a collection of 150 recipes inspired by Indian regional cuisines, culture, local foods, and proven cooking methods distributed over various chapters. Whether you want to add a bit of Indian flavor to your cooking, try some new spices, or add more protein using legumes and lentils to everyday meals, this book has got it covered. 

Let us go on a journey where you can explore both familiar and new Indian flavors that are easy to make in your own kitchen. Everyday simple meals where nutrition-rich legumes, pulses, and vegetables are the stars in the first 6 chapters. Sauces and Curries with deep, complex flavors for special occasions or everyday in chapter 7. Fall in love with Indian food all over again. I remember eating fresh and wholesome foods as a way of life. Bulk-buying whole grains and having them milled at our local mill had a huge influence on the food I cook today. My recipes reflect my knowledge of Indian spices and traditions, as well as worldly influences. I strive hard to make my food accessible to everyone, vegan or not, and I strongly believe that vegan food can taste so good that everyone can enjoy it.

“Hartwig, a sports nutritionist and cocreator of the Whole30 diet plan, packs her fourth book on the subject with 150 recipes that are, as the cover proclaims in all-caps, “totally compliant.” That means heavy emphasis on eggs, meat, fish, and fresh vegetables, but no grains, dairy, legumes or added sugars. Whether or not one buys into Whole30, there is no denying that Hartwig has come up with a clever array of healthy and flavorful dishes. Highlights include Asian beef zoodle (zucchini noodles) soup, which is similar to Vietnamese pho but uses zucchini noodles, and grilled Jamaican jerk salmon with fresh mango salsa. Many of the recipes come courtesy of guest cooks from various food blogs. For instance, Michelle Smith, from the Whole Smiths blog, contributes cherry-chipotle BBQ chicken thighs, with the fruit providing the sweetness and ground chipotle bringing the heat. Veteran food and cocktail photographer Brent Herrig drives home the point that a burger served on a tomato slice is as delectable as one on a bun, and that meatballs do just fine in a cream sauce made with coconut milk.

Before Gabrielle Hamilton opened her acclaimed New York restaurant Prune, she spent twenty hard-living years trying to find purpose and meaning in her life. Blood, Bones & Butter follows an unconventional journey through the many kitchens Hamilton has inhabited through the years: the rural kitchen of her childhood, where her adored mother stood over the six-burner with an oily wooden spoon in hand; the kitchens of France, Greece, and Turkey, where she was often fed by complete strangers and learned the essence of hospitality; Hamilton’s own kitchen at Prune, with its many unexpected challenges; and the kitchen of her Italian mother-in-law, who serves as the link between Hamilton’s idyllic past and her own future family—the result of a prickly marriage that nonetheless yields lasting dividends. By turns epic and intimate, Gabrielle Hamilton’s story is told with uncommon honesty, grit, humor, and passion.

Chapter 1

Section 1

GEAR

Gear is like booze. As you get older, you realize that quality is more important than quantity. I’d rather own one reliable, straight-­shooting rifle than an arsenal of cheaply built guns. But a painful fact about high-­quality hunting gear is that it tends to come at a high price. When you’re considering your gear budget, it’s important to step back and take a wide-­angle look at your spending habits. I was once hunting elk in Montana when a guy pulled up to a trailhead in a shiny new $40,000 pickup in order to study a distant mountainside through a pair of $20 binoculars that would do little more than impair his natural vision. Of course, there’s no way of knowing if that guy actually owned that truck, but you get my point: a serious hunter would have sacrificed the status car in order to afford a set of hard-­core binoculars that could tear the mountainside to shreds.

That said, it’s certainly true that gear does not make the man (or woman). If you don’t have the discipline and drive to become a good hunter, no amount of high-­dollar equipment is going to make up for that. But my theory on gear is that the hunter should be the weakest link on a hunt. I expect my gear to outperform me, so I have only myself to blame for my hunting failures. If I bail on a hunt early, it better be because I couldn’t hack it, not because the sole of my boot peeled off or my rifle scope started making rattling noises after getting dinged on a rock.

When it comes to selecting hunting gear, I’ve found that personal recommendations from experienced hunters are far more valuable than any insights you might glean from reading descriptions about a product in catalogs. When a hunter tells me that he’s been using a piece of gear for three seasons and has logged dozens of days in the field with it, I start to listen. In fact, most of the gear that you’ll encounter in the following pages came to my attention in just that way: as recommendations from folks I trust. I then put the items through my own series of tests. The opinions that you’ll be reading in this section come from decades of serious hunting, years that have been punctuated with many moments of great triumph—­and many more moments of misery and frustration.

THE RIFLE



Don’t be intimidated by anyone’s experience, including mine. There have been and still are a few good writers with vast experience in the firearms field. There are also plenty of plain old fools writing about guns and shooting and plenty of younger fools, as well. Gun writers, especially those who have to produce a regular column, love controversy. That column becomes a beast that must be fed every month, so the columnist is always hungry for something to write about and controversial ideas generate reader interest and response. Perhaps it is understandable if they sometimes go overboard. Just don’t go overboard with them.

—­Chuck Hawks

Hunters take the subject of rifles so seriously that arguments about calibers can literally end friendships. People are willing to go to blows in defense of their favorite gun’s reputation, and I suppose it’s for good reason. Your rifle is one of your most important pieces of big game hunting gear. If you lack faith in your rifle’s ability to shoot straight and true, it becomes hard to perform all the necessary work that goes into a successful hunt. While there are many styles of rifles on the market, including a rapidly increasing array of AR-­format weapons, the tried-­and-­true bolt-­action rifle is still the standard go-­to weapon for serious big game hunters. Properly tuned and outfitted, and with a disciplined and well-­practiced shooter, a high-­caliber bolt-­action rifle topped with a variable-­power scope can meet 95 percent of the big game hunting challenges that this continent has to offer. For maximum versatility and ease of finding ammunition, stick to common, time-­proven big game calibers such as .270, 7 mm Rem Mag, .30-­06, .308 Winchester, and .300 Win Mag (plus the short magnum versions of these same calibers). These might seem a tad heavy for a North Carolina whitetail deer hunter, and some might be a tad light for an Alaska hunter who’s itching to tangle with a coastal brown bear. But they are all superb guns for a generalist hunter who wants to be ready for anything without having to burn up his paychecks on an arsenal of weapons. After all, the North Carolina hunter might eventually run into one of that state’s 500-­pound black bears, and the Alaska hunter might get tired of trimming around fist-­sized exit holes blown through his game meat by a mule-­kicking elephant gun. 

Cartridge Nomenclature

Cartridge nomenclature is some very tricky business and manages to baffle the majority of firearm owners. The American system is particularly vexing, though the majority of American cartridges do provide the caliber (the diameter of the rifle bore) first in the name. For example, a .30-­06 is a .30-­caliber round, meaning that the bore diameter is 0.3 inch. The remainder of a cartridge’s name isn’t so formulaic. In the case of the .30-­06, for example, the name comes from the fact that it’s a .30-­caliber round that was first designed in 1906. The .300 Savage is another .30-­caliber round, though “Savage” comes from the name of a rifle manufacturer. Adding to the confusion is the fact that so-­called .30-­caliber rounds actually measure 0.308 inch. Thus, a cartridge called the .308 Winchester is in fact the same caliber as a .30-­06; like the .300 Savage, it carries the name of a rifle manufacturer.

Things are a little clearer with cartridges that were developed in the days of black powder, as the name carries the caliber and the original grain weight of the charge. A designation such as .45-­70 would have indicated a .45-­caliber bullet with a 70-­grain charge of black powder. Sometimes you’ll see an additional number on the end. For instance, a .45-­70-­405 would be a .45-­caliber bullet weighing 405 grains and charged by 70 grains of black powder.

The European stuff is simple, which should be expected from a continent that embraces the metric system. A 7.62×39 is a 7.62 mm bullet with a case length of 39 mm. Across a wide variety of European cartridges, there is little or no variation in their system.

And then there are the “wildcat” cartridges, which find their genesis as experimental cartridges designed by tinkerers and ammunition manufacturers who blended available cartridges to make Franken-­ammo. For instance, the 7 mm-­08 comes from loading a 7 mm bullet into a .308 Winchester casing in a process known as “necking down” (reducing the neck of the case to accommodate a smaller bullet). Some of these wildcat experiments were successful in filling gaps between standard cartridges and are now produced by major ammunition companies.

CHOOSING A RIFLE SCOPE

The one thing to remember when considering the price and quality of a rifle scope (yes, there is a direct correlation) is this: better scopes buy you time. That is, a high-­quality scope will function better in low light conditions than a cheaply built scope, allowing you to shoot effectively earlier in the morning and later in the evening. Staring through scopes while you’re inside your favorite big-­box sporting goods store will rarely show you the differences that you’re paying for.

For a great do-­it-­all rifle scope, get a good-­quality 3–­9×40 mm scope with adjustable parallax from a reputable manufacturer such as Leupold, Nikon, or Vortex. Plan on paying at least $350. Never buy a scope that doesn’t carry a warranty. There are many alternatives to the 3–­9×40. For close-­range shooting, say out to 200 yards, a 2–­8×30 mm is all the scope you need. The smaller magnification allows for a huge field of view, making getting on target a breeze. When hunting in the West or anywhere else that requires longer-­range shooting, a scope with a 50 mm objective and a top end magnification of 16× or even 24× will help pull those critters in close for exact bullet placement. The 50 mm objective lens also draws in more light, buying you time during low light conditions.

Common Reticle Types

What the Hell Is Parallax?

Imagine an old-­fashioned speedometer in a car, where the needle sits in front of a fixed circular face printed with numbers. Now picture that speedometer when viewed from the passenger’s seat. From there, it’s hard to get an accurate reading on the needle’s position. While this isn’t a perfect analogy, it helps explain a vexing problem that many people have with rifle scopes. Scopes with a fixed focus (that is, any scope without an adjustable objective or an adjustable parallax knob) are prefocused at the factory. Typically, fixed-­focus scopes meant for center-­fire cartridges are focused at 100 yards; fixed-­focus scopes meant for air rifles or rim-­fire cartridges are focused at 50 yards. This doesn’t mean that these scopes are out of focus when looking at objects at other distances—­your eye does the work of correcting the focus. It could mean, however, that you’re looking at the crosshairs from the passenger seat. In other words, it might seem that the crosshairs drift around on the target with slight movements of your head. To correct this, make sure that your fixed-­focus scope roughly corresponds with the distances that you’re most likely to be shooting at. With a .22, that’s probably going to be a 50-­yard focus, and with center-­fires, 100 yards. But if you’re going to get serious about shooting accurately at longer ranges, you’ll want a scope with parallax adjustment.

In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements - fire, water, air, and earth - to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer. In the course of his journey, he discovers that the cook occupies a special place in the world, standing squarely between nature and culture. Both realms are transformed by cooking, and so, in the process, is the cook. 
Each section of Cooked tracks Pollan's effort to master a single classic recipe using one of the four elements. A North Carolina barbecue pit master tutors him in the primal magic of fire; a Chez Panisse-trained cook schools him in the art of braising; a celebrated baker teaches him how air transforms grain and water into a fragrant loaf of bread; and finally, several mad-genius ""fermentos"" (a tribe that includes brewers, cheese makers, and all kinds of picklers) reveal how fungi and bacteria can perform the most amazing alchemies of all. The listener learns alongside Pollan, but the lessons move beyond the practical to become an investigation of how cooking involves us in a web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, the soil, farmers, our history and culture, and, of course, the people our cooking nourishes and delights. Cooking, above all, connects us. 
The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume huge quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.

Waiter to the Rich and Shameless is not just a peek into the secretive inner workings of a legendary five-star restaurant; it is not just a celebrity tell-all or a scathing corporate analysis. It is a top-tier waiter's personal coming-of-age story, an intimate look into the complicated challenges of serving in the country's most elite, Hollywood-centric dining room while fighting to maintain a sense of self and purpose.
Of the many millions of food service workers around the globe, only a tiny number ever ascend to a top-level position at a world-renowned restaurant catering to iconic celebrities, moguls, and politicians. As one of those select few, Paul (""Pauli"") Hartford is the first waiter to open the door into a cloistered, coveted world of money, fame, bad behavior, and intrigue.

chapter 1

Breakfast

Who digs a pressure cooker out of the cabinet on a busy Tuesday morning? Not ­us—­but we do get it out for a Saturday ­mid- morning breakfast or any time we have weekend guests in from New York City. Or on the holidays when we’ve got a house full of family. Or during busy photo shoots when we want a hot breakfast. Come to think of it: we’ve probably pulled out the pressure cooker on a Tuesday morning.

Using a pressure cooker for breakfast isn’t just about faster cooking; it’s also about better cooking. Toast is fast. A pressure cooker layers depths of flavor in breakfast casseroles and compotes, hashes, and even porridges, all without much effort.

Take ­steel-­cut oats. Yes, they’re done in minutes under pressure, as opposed to a long simmer in a saucepan. But they’re also done better: they not only take on the vaunted creaminess that ­long-­cooking affords but also pick up more flavor from the surrounding liquid and dried fruit.

Retaining a bit of firmness underneath the velvety luxury, they end up with better texture and a more intense flavor. They’re definitely more satisfying than any microwave fare.

You may also be surprised at how pressure cooks eggs: the whites stay creamy and delicate; the yolks, set to your preference. At this point, we can’t imagine making ­soft-­boiled eggs any other way.

Of course, there’s a “but” or two: pay attention to the stated release in these recipes and follow the instructions carefully. Some grains get foamy under pressure and will spurt out of the pressure valve if you attempt a quick release when a natural one is called for. Others need a bit of time under a natural release so they can absorb moisture and get tender without going gummy.

Most whole grains need to be presoaked. And be prepared to eat when breakfast is ready. Many of these dishes ­aren’t forgiving: bread puddings can get dry; eggs can turn tough. So make the coffee, set the table, and prepare the breakfast recipe as the last task in the list. Listen, ­that’s not a bad thing. If ever a meal called for efficiency, it’s breakfast. The day awaits!

One more thing: we’ve adjusted the Effort label in this first chapter. That is, recipes that might have been marked “a little” in a subsequent chapter are labeled “a lot” of effort here. Given that we stumble around half blind before our second cup of coffee, we sometimes think melting butter in the morning qualifies as heroic.

So here are some fine hot cereals, breakfast bread puddings, potato hashes, and fruit compotes. We’ve even got a fine and fast sausage gravy, a sweet breakfast version of polenta, and an innovative ­top-­of-­the-­morning risotto for a special treat. You provide the toast and coffee; the pressure cooker will do the rest.

Apple Maple Oatmeal

Effort: Not much • Pressure: High • Time under pressure: 12 or 18 minutes • Release: Natural • Serves: 4

1/2 cup ­steel-­cut oats

1/2 cup chopped dried apples

1/4 cup maple syrup

1/4 cup sliced almonds

1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon salt

1Mix everything with 21/4 cups water in a ­6-­quart stovetop or electric pressure cooker.

2Lock the lid onto the pot.

STOVETOP: Set the pot over high heat and bring it to high pressure (15 psi). Once the pressure has been reached, reduce the heat as much as possible while keeping this pressure constant. Cook for

12 minutes.

OR

ELECTRIC: Set the machine to cook at high pressure (9–11 psi). Set the machine’s timer to cook at this pressure for 18 minutes.

3Reduce the pressure.

STOVETOP: Set the pot off the heat and let its pressure return to normal, about 10 minutes.

OR

ELECTRIC: Turn off the machine or unplug it so it ­doesn’t jump to its ­keep-­warm setting. Allow the pot’s pressure to return to normal, 10 to 12 minutes.

If the pressure in the pot ­hasn’t come back to normal within 12 minutes, use the ­quick-­release method to bring it back to normal.

4Unlock and open the pot; stir well before serving.

Testers’ Notes

This is a ­whole-­grain breakfast in minutes! It’s one of the perks of owning a pressure cooker.

Use only ­steel-­cut oats (also called “pinhead oats” or “Irish oats”), not rolled oats and not the more ground Scottish oats, and certainly not instant oats. ­Steel-­cut oats are the whole groats (bran, germ, and endosperm), cut into smaller pieces.

Don’t even think about using anything but real maple syrup in this recipe.

You can substitute chopped dried pears, nectarines, peaches, or apricots for the apples.

Serve It Up! Warm some milk, ­half-­and-­half, or cream in a small saucepan over low heat or in the microwave for a couple of minutes on high (but do not boil). Pour over each serving.

Creamy Banana Oatmeal

Effort: Not much • Pressure: High • Time under pressure: 12 or 18 minutes • Release: Natural • Serves: 4

1/2 cup ­steel-­cut oats

1/2 cup packed light brown sugar

2 ripe bananas, chopped

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon salt

1/4 cup heavy cream

1Mix the oats, brown sugar, bananas, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt with 21/4 cups water in a ­6-­quart stovetop or electric pressure cooker until the brown sugar dissolves.

2Lock the lid onto the pot.

STOVETOP: Set the pot over high heat and bring it to high pressure (15 psi). Once this pressure

has been reached, reduce the heat as much as possible while maintaining this pressure. Cook for

12 minutes.

OR

ELECTRIC: Set the machine to cook at high pressure (9–11 psi). Set the machine’s timer to cook at high pressure for 18 minutes.

3Reduce the pressure.

STOVETOP: Set the pot off the heat and let its pressure fall to normal naturally, about 10 minutes.

OR

ELECTRIC: Turn off the machine or unplug it so it ­doesn’t flip to its ­keep-­warm setting. Allow the pot’s pressure to come to normal naturally, 10 to 12 minutes.

If the pot’s pressure ­hasn’t returned to normal within 12 minutes, use the ­quick-­release method to bring it back to normal.

4Unlock and open the cooker. Stir in the cream and set aside for 1 minute to warm before serving.

Testers’ Notes

Don’t double the amount of oats in any of these porridges: the grains are stocked with a sticky starch that will rise up and clog the pressure release valve. If you’ve got more than four persons for breakfast, make two batches.

For the best flavor, the bananas should be quite ripe, their skins mottled with plenty of brown spots. Look for the ones just about to be discounted: these are the best candidates.

You can substitute light cream, ­half-­and-­half, regular evaporated milk, or almond milk for the heavy cream.

Bulgur, Oat, and Walnut Porridge

Effort: A little • Pressure: High • Time under pressure: 16 or 24 minutes • Release: Quick • Serves: 6 to 8

1/2 cup ­steel-­cut oats

1/2 cup bulgur

1/2 cup chopped walnuts

1/2 cup maple syrup

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon salt

1Mix everything with 4 cups water in a ­6-­quart stovetop or electric pressure cooker.

2Lock the lid onto the pot.

STOVETOP: Set the pot over high heat and bring it to high pressure (15 psi). Once this pressure has been reached, reduce the heat as much as possible while keeping the pressure constant. Cook for

16 minutes.

OR

ELECTRIC: Set the machine to cook at high pressure (9–11 psi). Set the machine’s timer to cook at high pressure for 24 minutes.

3Use the ­quick-­release method to bring the pot’s pressure back to normal.

4Unlock and remove the lid. Set the stovetop cooker over medium heat or turn the electric cooker to its browning function. Bring to a simmer, stirring often. Cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.

Testers’ Notes

Because of the way bulgur absorbs water, there may be a little liquid left in the cereal after ­cooking—­a good thing, since it can scorch otherwise. So we advise simmering the cereal after cooking under pressure. That said, if you open the pot and find the porridge has a consistency to your liking, there’s no need for that extra work in step 4.

Bulgur is sold by ­grinds—­fine, ­medium-­coarse, and ­extra-­coarse. However, those grinds are often not labeled on the packaging except in certain brands sold at ­health-­food or gourmet stores. Any grind will work here, although fine (sometimes labeled “instant”) is probably the least successful, more like Cream of Wheat.

Maple syrup is sold by grades, with some packagers using letters and others using numbers: A or 1 is the lighter in flavor. Grade A or 1 is further broken down into light amber, medium amber, and dark amber. While many people like Grade A or 1 for pancakes, we prefer Grade B or 2 because of its more assertive flavor, including darkly herbaceous notes to pair against the other intense flavors.

Substitute chopped pecans or pistachios for the walnuts.

Serve It Up! Put a pat of butter and some freshly grated nutmeg on each serving.

Cheesy Grits

Effort: A lot • Pressure: High • Time under pressure: 12 or 18 minutes • Release: Modified natural • Serves: 4 to 6

1 cup corn grits (not instant)

2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into very small bits

1/2 teaspoon salt

1 cup finely grated Cheddar cheese, preferably white (about 4 ounces)

Bottled hot red pepper sauce, such as Tabasco, to taste

1Set the pressure cooker rack inside a stovetop or electric cooker; pour in 2 cups water. Make an aluminum foil sling (see page 19) and set a ­2-­quart, ­high-­sided, round baking or soufflé dish on it. Mix the grits, butter, and salt with 21/2 cups water in the baking dish until smooth.

2Use the foil sling to lower the uncovered dish onto the rack in the cooker. (Do not cover the baking dish.) Fold the ends of the sling so they’ll fit inside the cooker.

3Lock the lid onto the pot.

STOVETOP: Set the pot over high heat and bring it to high pressure (15 psi). Once this pressure has been reached, reduce the heat as much as possible while keeping this pressure constant. Cook for

12 minutes.

OR

ELECTRIC: Set the machine to cook at high pressure (9–11 psi). Set the machine’s timer to cook at this pressure for 18 minutes.

4Turn off the heat and or unplug the machine. Set aside for 5 minutes, then use the ­quick-­release method to drop the pot’s pressure back to normal.

5Unlock and remove the lid. Lift the baking dish out of the cooker with its sling, steadying it as necessary to get it to a cutting board. Stir in the cheese and hot red pepper sauce; set aside for 1 minute to melt the cheese before serving.

Testers’ Notes

If you’ve never had cheese grits from a pressure cooker, you’re missing the creamiest cheese grits available. The intense cooking environment forces just the right amount of moisture into the bits of corn, and even without stirring, it’s perfect every time.

There’s no reason to use a ­run-­of-­the-­mill hot red pepper sauce here. Check out versions with smoky chipotles or even fiery habanero chiles.

Serve It Up! Spoon the grits onto a plate and top each serving with a fried egg; serve bacon on the side.

Apple, Ham, and Grits Casserole

Effort: A lot • Pressure: High • Time under pressure: 15 or 22 minutes • Release: Quick • Serves: 4 to 6

2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for buttering the dish

8 ounces Canadian bacon, chopped

1 medium tart green apple, such as Granny Smith, peeled, cored, and chopped

4 medium scallions, green and white parts, trimmed and sliced into thin bits

1 teaspoon dried thyme

3/4 cup ­quick-­cooking or instant grits

2 large eggs, lightly beaten

1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (about 2 ounces)

1Melt the butter in a ­6-­quart stovetop pressure cooker set over medium heat or in a ­6-­quart electric pressure cooker turned to the browning function. Add the Canadian bacon; cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Add the apple, scallions, and thyme; cook for 1 more minute, stirring constantly. Scrape the contents of the cooker into a large bowl. Wipe out the cooker with a damp paper towel.

2Set the stovetop model back over medium heat or turn the electric one back to its browning or simmer mode. Add 3 cups water and bring to a boil. Whisk in the grits and cook, whisking all the while, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Scrape the grits into the bowl with the bacon mixture; cool for 10 minutes. Wash and dry the cooker.

3Set the pressure cooker rack inside the cooker and pour in 2 cups water. Make a foil sling (see page 19) and set a ­2-­quart, ­high-­sided, round baking or soufflé dish on top of it. Lightly butter the inside of the dish.

4Stir the eggs and cheese into the grits mixture until uniform and well combined. Spread the mixture in the prepared baking dish; cover and seal with foil. Lower the dish onto the rack in the cooker with the sling. Fold the ends of the sling so they’ll fit inside the cooker.

5Lock the lid onto the pot.

STOVETOP: Set the pot over high heat and bring it to high pressure (15 psi). Once this pressure has been reached, reduce the heat as much as possible while keeping this pressure constant. Cook for

15 minutes.

OR

ELECTRIC: Set the machine to cook at high pressure (9–11 psi). Set the machine’s timer to cook at this pressure for 22 minutes.

6Use the ­quick-­release method to bring the pot’s pressure back to normal.

7Unlock and open the cooker. Use the sling to transfer the baking dish to a wire cooling rack, steadying the dish as necessary. Uncover, cool a couple of minutes, and spoon the casserole onto individual plates to serve.

Testers’ Notes

Here’s the perfect brunch dish: a creamy, cheesy casserole with big flavors. You just need the mimosas.

Be careful: the cooker will be hot as you wipe it out between steps of this recipe.

You can make the recipe through step 3 up to 1 hour in advance.

Try substituting one ripe Bosc pear for the apple. You can also substitute Monterey jack or Swiss for the Cheddar.

Serve It Up! For breakfast, garnish with maple syrup. For lunch, offer a tossed green salad on the side. For dinner, pour a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.

“One of the great culinary stories of our time.”—Dwight Garner, The New York Times
 
It begins with a simple ritual: Every Saturday afternoon, a boy who loves to cook walks to his grandmother’s house and helps her prepare a roast chicken for dinner. The grandmother is Swedish, a retired domestic. The boy is Ethiopian and adopted, and he will grow up to become the world-renowned chef Marcus Samuelsson. This book is his love letter to food and family in all its manifestations. Yes, Chef chronicles Samuelsson’s journey, from his grandmother’s kitchen to his arrival in New York City, where his outsize talent and ambition finally come together at Aquavit, earning him a New York Times three-star rating at the age of twenty-four. But Samuelsson’s career of chasing flavors had only just begun—in the intervening years, there have been White House state dinners, career crises, reality show triumphs, and, most important, the opening of Red Rooster in Harlem. At Red Rooster, Samuelsson has fulfilled his dream of creating a truly diverse, multiracial dining room—a place where presidents rub elbows with jazz musicians, aspiring artists, and bus drivers. It is a place where an orphan from Ethiopia, raised in Sweden, living in America, can feel at home.

Praise for Yes, Chef
 
“Such an interesting life, told with touching modesty and remarkable candor.”—Ruth Reichl
 
“Marcus Samuelsson has an incomparable story, a quiet bravery, and a lyrical and discreetly glittering style—in the kitchen and on the page. I liked this book so very, very much.”—Gabrielle Hamilton
 
“Plenty of celebrity chefs have a compelling story to tell, but none of them can top [this] one.”—The Wall Street Journal
 
“Elegantly written . . . Samuelsson has the flavors of many countries in his blood.”—The Boston Globe
 
“Red Rooster’s arrival in Harlem brought with it a chef who has reinvigorated and reimagined what it means to be American. In his famed dishes, and now in this memoir, Marcus Samuelsson tells a story that reaches past racial and national divides to the foundations of family, hope, and downright good food.”—President Bill Clinton",,,,"['marcus samuelsson', 'yes chef', 'new york', 'red rooster', 'hard work', 'well written', 'top chef', 'highly recommend', 'work ethic', 'life story', 'thoroughly enjoyed', 'chef masters', 'york city', 'adopted by a swedish', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Entrepreneur for 30+ years in the food world as a bestselling author, chef and creator of delicious, decadent, healthful plant-based food, MIYOKO SCHINNER is dedicated to pleasing the omnivore’s palate in all of us. She refuses to give up on those who haven’t made the switch to plant-based foods and continues to offer progress through the senses, not just the intellect, using diverse avenues. These have included a restaurant and natural food company that distributed products nationwide and supplied cookies and pastries to United Airlines.
 
Inspiring the general public through her 5 cookbooks, including the best-selling and “groundbreaking” Artisan Vegan Cheese and the just-published The Homemade Vegan Pantry, Schinner also recognizes that not everyone will take up the cause in their own kitchens. To answer this call, in 2014, she launched an artisan vegan cheese company, Miyoko’s Kitchen, which set out to redefine the category of “cheese” with its unctuous, decadent, delicious flavors of handcrafted cheeses made from nuts. Miyoko’s Kitchen currently ships nationwide through ecommerce as well as regular distribution channels, and exports to Australia and Hong Kong.
 
No stranger to public speaking or media attention, Schinner also co-hosts the national cooking show Vegan Mashup, presents live at major events around the country, and is frequently featured in national and local media.

“Bitter Brew deftly chronicles the contentious succession of kings in a uniquely American dynasty. You’ll never crack open a six again without thinking of this book.” (John Sayles, Director of ""Eight Men Out"" and author of A Moment in the Sun)

“As the Busch family goes, so goes America. Bill Knoedelseder has taken their multi-generational saga and boiled it down into a heartfelt, hilarious ode to beer, baseball and business.” (Michael London, Academy Award-nominated producer of ""Sideways"")

“A great American story told as well and it could be told. I’ll never drink a Bud the same way again.” (Larry Leamer, bestselling author of the Kennedy family trilogy, The Kennedy Women, The Kennedy Men and Sons of Camelot)

“An engrossing behind-the-scenes look at one of America’s most successful and familiar brands.” (Kirkus Reviews)

“[A] thoroughly researched and thoughtfully written book.” (Publishers Weekly)

“…well-written, and thoroughly documented company history…VERDICT A real-life family saga, this book is full of domestic and company details, some of which are sordid, others commendable. Recommended for readers interested in the backstory behind the King of Beers.” (Library Journal)

“An engrossing saga of the Busch family, one of the wealthiest, longest-lasting, and most colorful family dynasties in the history of American commerce.” (USA Today)

“[I]ntoxicating reading... This is a lurid, fascinating tale, which narrowly escapes the charge of being sensationalist thanks to its factual grounding and the significance of its subject-a family business that managed to dominate an industry but could not get its own dysfunction under control.” (Wall Street Journal)

From the Back Cover
Stretching across three centuries, from the start of the Civil War through Prohibition to today, Bitter Brew is the engrossing, often scandalous saga of one of the wealth- iest and most colorful dynasties in American commerce: the Busch family of St. Louis, Missouri, the founders of the legendary Anheuser-Busch company. The critically acclaimed journalist William Knoedelseder tells the story of how the Busch patriarchs turned a small brewery into a multibillion dollar international corporation and trans- formed their product, Budweiser, into the iconic ""King of Beers."" He paints a fascinating portrait of immense wealth and power accompanied by scandal, heartbreak, tragedy, and untimely death. A cautionary tale of prosperity, hubris, and loss, Bitter Brew is also a revealing chronicle of American progress and decline over the past 150 years.

""...The most beautiful bread book yet published..."" – The New York Times

Tartine - A bread bible for the home baker or professional bread-maker! It comes from Chad Robertson, a man many consider to be the best bread baker in the United States, and co-owner with Elizabeth Prueitt of San Francisco's Tartine Bakery. At 5 P.M., Chad Robertson's rugged, magnificent Tartine loaves are drawn from the oven. The bread at San Francisco's legendary Tartine Bakery sells out within an hour almost every day.

Only a handful of bakers have learned the bread science techniques Chad Robertson has developed: To Chad Robertson, bread is the foundation of a meal, the center of daily life, and each loaf tells the story of the baker who shaped it. Chad Robertson developed his unique bread over two decades of apprenticeship with the finest artisan bakers in France and the United States, as well as experimentation in his own ovens. Readers will be astonished at how elemental it is.

Bread making the Tartine Way: Now it's your turn to make this bread with your own hands. Clear instructions and hundreds of step-by-step photos put you by Chad's side as he shows you how to make exceptional and elemental bread using just flour, water, and salt.

Chad Robertson (co-owner, with his wife, Elisabeth Prueitt, of San Francisco's Tartine, Bar Tartine) brings his master Tartine Bread technique to those who may not have the chance to try the famed Bay Area loaves hot out of the oven. This ""baker's guidebook"" is divided into four parts: Basic Country Bread; Semolina and Whole-Wheat Breads; Baguettes and Enriched Breads; and Day-Old Bread. Robertson's basic recipe is explained in depth with numbered steps, and consists of making a natural leaven and baking in a cast-iron cooker. The author's passionate tone and tales of baking apprenticeships, along with top-notch step-by-step photos, elevate the title from mere manual to enjoyable read. The later sections include variations on the basic recipe; bread-to-use recipes for sandwiches; bruschetta; and salads and entrees made with croutons and breadcrumbs. The sophisticated and clean design, exceptional photos, and padded cover give the book a luxurious feel. (Nov.)

With more than 1,000 full-color photographs, How to Grill shows 100 techniques, from how to set up a three-tiered fire to how to grill a prime rib, a porterhouse, a pork tenderloin, or a chicken breast. There are techniques for smoking ribs, cooking the perfect burger, rotisserieing a whole chicken, barbecuing a fish; for grilling pizza, shellfish, vegetables, tofu, fruit, and s'mores.

The giddy joy that comes with picking up this tribute to outdoor cooking is comparable to the adolescent thrill of sneaking a naughty magazine into the garage. Not only does every conceivable meat, fish and fowl get its turn over the coals, there is a whole Barbecued Cabbage stuffed with bacon and onion and even a grilled Creme Brulee. Raichlen focuses on creative techniques, employing everything from butcher's string and bricks wrapped in foil to inserting a half-full can of beer into the cavity of a chicken: when placed on the grill it simultaneously steams the bird and holds it upright, allowing the skin to grow crisp. Indeed, Raichlen's approach is anything but shy. However, to limit the book to a manageable size, Raichlen presents just one or two recipes for each cut of meat or type of seafood. Thus a single lamb is chopped into a new-world-order menu of Rack of Lamb Marrakech, Sichuan-Spiced Loin Lamb Chops and Leg of Lamb Provencal. Throughout, every recipe is made foolproof with step-by-step instructions and, happily, a photo accompanies every one of the steps. While none could be considered a full-fledged centerfold, it is impossible not to gaze upon them and lust. —Publishers Weekly

First of all, thanks for reading about my first audiobook. I hope you buy it - and not just because each purchase gets me one step closer to buying the leather pants of my dreams.
I hope you buy Fat Girl Walking because I want to start a conversation. Or continue a conversation, one I inadvertently started a while ago when I took my clothes off on a stage in front of 700 people. A lot of people thought I was awesome for doing that. A lot of others thought a size 18 woman had absolutely no business showing off her body. Unfortunately for them, I've made it my personal mission to destroy the ridiculous myth that every woman who is overweight hates her body and herself. I, Brittany Gibbons, and the Curvy Girls I speak to every day on the Internet, beg to differ. We love our bodies. We love fashion. We are in loving relationships, having lots of sex. We aren't just a fetish, we're normal women. Sure, sometimes we doubt ourselves, we're not robots, but not anymore than EVERY OTHER WOMAN ON THE PLANET. See, Fat Girls aren't freaks of nature. We're just like you. Maybe we are you.
Fat Girl Walking is a collection of stories from my life, my thoughts about the issues that I have faced as a woman, wife, mom, daughter, daughter-in-law, and Internet personality in regards to my weight. I have tried to be as honest as I possibly could - apologies in advance to my husband and parents, but hopefully any discomfort you feel is quickly replaced by laughter. The insecure texts to my husband and summer camp hijinks are hilarious if I do say so myself. And I also ask some tough questions, things like ""What if my husband weighs less than I do?"" and ""Is my body hate ruining my daughter's life?""
Listen to Fat Girl Walking and let's start having these conversations. No pressure, but we may just save all of womankind.
Love,
Brittany",,,,[]

A literal encyclopedia of recipes (culled from the magazine), this revision to Cook's Illustrated's popular The Best Recipe is almost double in size and includes more than 1,000 recipes. Cook's Illustrated is known for careful (some would say compulsive) testing of recipes with a focus on foolproof technique; detailed line drawings that take readers step-by-step through recipes; and opinionated guides that assert that their way is the best way. This methodology appeals particularly to a specific kind of cook, one with a primarily scientific rather than artistic or intuitive approach to cooking. Though there are a few photographs, readers who buy cookbooks for full-color photographs and personal anecdotes aren't likely to be drawn to this work. Twenty-two chapters cover appetizers to desserts. Even the simplest tasks, such as blanching vegetables or peeling an egg, are explained and illustrated in detail. More involved techniques include brining poultry and roasting a turkey. Pad Thai gets a full-page description with photographs to help home cooks learn how to properly soak the noodles. Well organized and extremely clear, the book has only one drawback: its heft may make it tough to hoist onto kitchen counters.

Potato Salad
Serves 12

When it comes to potato salad, you like what you like. This recipe is mayonnaise-based, but if you like a mustard-based potato salad, just experiment a little. Add some yellow mustard and leave out a little bit of the mayonnaise. Make these recipes your own by finding out what works for you. Our traditional potato salad uses peeled potatoes, but unpeeled work too, and the skins add some color to your dish.

5 pounds red potatoes, peeled and cut in 1⁄2-inch ­cubes
2 teaspoons salt, plus more to ­taste
4 hard­-­boiled eggs, peeled, and ­diced
3⁄4 cup ­mayonnaise
1⁄2 cup sweet pickle ­relish
Black ­pepper

Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan or pressure cooker (see Note). Add 2 teaspoons salt and enough water to cover the potatoes. Boil the potatoes for 30 minutes, or until they are tender when pierced with the point of a knife but hold their shape. Drain the potatoes, transfer them to a large mixing bowl, and allow them to cool completely. Add the chopped eggs, mayonnaise, and sweet relish, and fold gently to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate until ready to serve.


From Gwen:
Don’t overcook the potatoes. They should hold their shape during mixing.

Note: The potatoes may be cooked in a pressure cooker. Sprinkle salt over the potatoes. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and pressure-cook for 5 minutes. Release the pressure immediately and drain and cool the potatoes.





Serves 8

This is a nice variation on regular sweet potatoes for a Thanksgiving side dish. It's almost a dessert, it's so sweet!

   • 5 medium sweet potatoes (about
9 ounces each)
   • 2 large eggs
   • 1 cup granulated sugar
   • 1 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, at room temperature
   • 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
   • 1/2 cup milk
   • Pinch of salt




   • 1 cup finely chopped pecans
   • 1 cup brown sugar, packed
   • 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
   • 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, softened


1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Grease a 2 1/2-quart baking dish with butter. On a foil-covered baking sheet, bake the sweet potatoes for 1 hour, or until they are soft. When cool enough to handle, peel the potatoes, place the flesh in a large mixing bowl, and mash until very smooth. Add the eggs, sugar, butter, vanilla, milk, and salt. Combine well with an electric mixer or hand mixer. Turn the mixture into the baking dish.

2. In a medium bowl, stir together the pecans, brown sugar, flour, and butter until thoroughly combined. Spoon the mixture over the sweet potatoes, making an even layer. Bake the casserole for 30 minutes, or until slightly browned. Let the casserole sit for 5 minutes before serving.

In The Negative Calorie Diet, Rocco DiSpirito shares how simple it is to eat wholesome, delicious foods that naturally support weight loss. He calls these foods “negative calorie foods”—foods that help you to burn body fat, lose weight, and boost your metabolism. These whole foods are packed with fiber, so not only do you tend to eat smaller portions of them naturally, but you also stay fuller, longer. These nutritious superfoods offer the essential vitamins and minerals the body needs to keep your metabolism running efficiently. Some even offer what is known as a “thermogenic effect”—effectively boosting your metabolism to increase the rate at which your body burns energy. And you can eat as much of them as you want!
Rocco begins with a ten-day cleanse designed to kick-start weight loss and detox the body, preparing it to reap the benefits of a nutrient-rich, whole foods diet. Next comes the twenty-day meal plan, with step-by-step guidance to help you achieve maximum results. To make it easy, Rocco gives you more than seventy-five recipes for meals, snacks, smoothies, and desserts that use his Top 10 Negative Calorie Foods: almonds, apples, berries, celery, citrus fruits, cruciferous vegetables (such as cauliflower and Brussels sprouts), cucumbers, leafy greens (including Swiss chard, spinach, and kale), mushrooms, and nightshade vegetables, including peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, and more.
Complete with grocery shopping lists, troubleshooting FAQs, a guide to dining out, and advice for adapting the plan for kids and families as well as vegetarian, gluten-free, and low-sugar lifestyles, The Negative Calorie Diet helps you build healthy habits to lose weight and achieve better health for a lifetime.",32289,"Review
“Finally I can have my cake and eat it too! Rocco’s whole foods approach to weight loss is smart and satisfying. When you follow his plan, you never feel like you’re on a ‘diet.’” (Stacy London, bestselling author and contributor to The View)

“Rocco’s way of eating is all about real food, real fuel, real results. Do not be afraid. You will never go hungry on this plan!” (Daymond John, Entrepreneur and co-Star of Shark Tank)

“Rocco’s whole food / no calorie counting approach to meal planning, delivers dramatic transformational results that I’ve personally witnessed. Over the years, we’ve collaborated on patients’ care...And, all the patients find the food delicious!” (Dr. Jeffrey A. Morrison M.D., Founder of The Morrison Center and acclaimed Weight Loss Expert and Practitioner Of Integrative Medicine)

EAT REAL FOOD. LOSE MORE WEIGHT . . . FASTER.
Most diets are about one thing: restricting calories. And while it’s true that cutting calories can be a component of weight loss, not all calories are created equal. The secret to fast, lasting weight loss isn’t how much you eat—it’s what you eat.
Eating high-quality, whole foods causes the body to burn fat and lose weight, while eating low-quality, processed foods causes the body to store fat and gain weight. A diet rich in real, unprocessed foods is a satisfying way to lose weight for people who love to eat.  Because not only does it offer the vitamins and nutrients your body needs to fuel your metabolism, it also allows you to eat unlimited quantities of delicious, satisfying foods. Some whole foods even offer what is known as a “thermogenic effect”—boosting the rate at which your body burns calories. In short: eating the right foods can have a negative calorie effect!

""It's a little-known fact that the information in here will make anyone look and sound better than they actually do""
-David Baldacci


""...this is a wonderfully entertaining read, slight enough to be digested in one sitting, clever enough to be entertaining even if you never make a single one of the cocktails.""
-World of Beer blog


""Tequila Mockingbird is a refreshing reminder that drinking is supposed to be fun, and it brings together the kind of cocktails you'll actually make into a book you'll actually use.""
-DrinkSpirits.com


""You've never seen so many literary inside jokes in your whole life, which makes this little cookbook my new favorite thing... The commentary is hilarious, to boot.""
-FoodRiot


""Ingredient by ingredient I became a fan of the ersatz bartending guide for English majors, in which summaries of classic novels and their corresponding recipes are garnished with groan-worthy puns and sepia-toned illustrations. I toast to that!""



""Pun-tastic cocktail delights . . . peruse it to find your book club's next read (and cocktail).""

Essentials of Italian Cooking is a culinary bible for anyone looking to master the art of Italian cooking, bringing together Marcella Hazan’s most beloved books, The Classic Italian Cook Book and More Classic Italian Cooking, in a single volume, updated and expanded with new entries and 50 new recipes. Designed as a basic manual for cooks of all levels of expertise—from beginners to accomplished professionals—it offers both an accessible and comprehensive guide to techniques and ingredients and a collection of the most delicious recipes from the Italian repertoire. As home cooks who have used Marcella’s classic books for years (and whose copies are now splattered and worn) know, there is no one more gifted at teaching us just what we need to know about the taste and texture of a dish and how to achieve it, and there is no one more passionate and inspiring about authentic Italian food.",4257,"Amazon.com Review
Perhaps more than any other person, Marcella Hazan is responsible for bringing Italian cuisine into the homes of American cooks. We're not talking spaghetti and meatballs here--Hazan's cuisine consists of polenta, risotto, squid braised with tomatoes and white wine, sautéed swiss chard with olive oil and garlic.... Twenty years ago, when Hazan first exploded into the American consciousness with The Classic Italian Cook Book and More Classic Italian Cooking, such recipes were revolutionary. With time, however, these classic dishes have become much-beloved family favorites.
Now a new generation is ready to be introduced to Marcella Hazan's way with food, and in Essentials of Italian Cooking Hazan combines her two earlier works into one update and expanded volume. In addition to the delicious collection of recipes, this book serves as a basic manual for cooks of every skill level. Recipes have been revised to reduce fat content, and a whole new chapter full of fundamental information about herbs, spices, and cheeses used in Italian kitchens--as well as details on how to select specific ingredients--has been added. New chapters, new recipes--who could ask for more than Essentials of Italian Cooking?
From Publishers Weekly
In the language of cookbooks, the word ""classic"" is bandied about nearly as frequently as the terms ""low-fat"" and ""no-cholesterol."" In this case, however, the estimable Hazan ( More Classic Italian Cooking ) does indeed contribute a classic to the ever-increasing literature of Italian cuisine. A revision and update of her two previous ""classic"" Italian cookbooks (with more than 35 completely new recipes), this one includes recipes not ""in pursuit of novelty, but of taste."" As Hazan puts it, the book ""is meant to be used as a kitchen handbook . . . for cooks of every level . . . who want an accessible and comprehensive guide to the products, the techniques, and the dishes that constitute imperishable Italian cooking."" From marinated carrot sticks to sweet-and-sour tuna steaks, Trapani style, to tortellini with fish stuffing and polenta shortcake with raisins, dried figs and pine nuts, the outstanding recipes--many of them poetically simple--are too numerous to do justice to in few words. Included is a spirited discussion of squid and the essentials of preparing fresh pasta, gnocchi (potato dumplings), authentic risotto, frittate and polenta dishes. While writing from Venice, her home for much of the year, Hazan never fails to consider the availability of ingredients in the U.S., and never assumes that all readers understand complex methods or exotic terminology. This volume is the perfect gift for a new homemaker, a seasoned chef and all lovers of good food. Illustrated. 40,000 first printing; Home Style Book Club main selection, BOMC alternate.

Tens of thousands of people have already used this groundbreaking guide to shatter the vicious sugar stronghold. Now it's your turn!

Use the easy-to-follow meal plans and more than 90 simple recipes in this book to bust a lifetime of sugar and carb cravings in just three weeks. Three levels of the program make it approachable for anyone, whether you're starting from scratch or from a gluten-free, grain-free, and/or Paleo/primal lifestyle.

The 21-Day Sugar Detox even includes special modifications for athletes (endurance, CrossFit, HIIT-style, and beyond), pregnant/nursing moms, pescetarians, and people with autoimmune conditions.

What you'll experience on this program will be different from a lot of other ""diet"" programs out there that promote extremely restricted eating; encourage you to consume only shakes, juices, or smoothies; or rely heavily on supplements and very-low-calorie or very-low-fat diets to ensure success. The goal of any detox program should be to support your body in naturally cleansing itself of substances that create negative health effects--and that's exactly what The 21-Day Sugar Detox does.

By focusing on quality protein, healthy fats, and good carbs, this program will help you change not only the foods you eat, but also your habits around food, and even the way your palate reacts to sweet foods. You'll likely complete the program and continue eating this way much of the time thereafter because you'll feel so amazing. After changing your everyday eating habits, you will begin to gain a new understanding of how food works in your body--and just how much nutrition affects your entire life. There's no reason to wait!

Sugar is taking over our lives.

But why? And is it only those sweet, refined white crystals that are causing us problems, or could there be more to the story?

Let's be honest: The problem isn't just sugar itself. It's the refined, nutrient-poor carbohydrates that carry tons of calories, but no real nutrition. In our world, these are the easiest foods to grab on the go, but they leave us fat, sick, tired, and downright unhappy.

The effect that sugar, ""hidden"" carbs, and refined, processed foods have on our bodies goes far beyond our waistlines. We can't focus, we can't sleep, we have irrational mid-afternoon cravings, and we can't even make it through the day without wanting--or needing--to prop up our energy levels with caffeine or even more sugar! What can we do to break free from this cycle? The 21-Day Sugar Detox is here to help.",25745,"Review

Introduction

The Instant Pot—an electric, programmable pressure cooker—has quickly become one of the most popular kitchen appliances on the market. If you grew up with a traditional stove-top pressure cooker, you’ll be amazed at how far pressure cooking has come. 

Gone are the days of the scary, rocking pressure regulator on stove-top models. The Instant Pot is whisper quiet while it cooks foods under pressure. It’s also extremely versatile. With a wide range of programmable settings, it does the job of a traditional pressure cooker as well as a slow cooker, rice cooker, and yogurt maker. 

Indeed, the range of foods you can cook in the Instant Pot is nothing short of mind-blowing. It’ll turn out both a pot of chili and the loaf of cornbread to go alongside it, a kid-friendly macaroni and cheese that’s ready in a snap, and a silkysmooth cheesecake that will be the envy of every home baker. 

This cookbook will tell you how to make those dishes and more. It includes seven chapters of recipes that range from globally inspired dishes to retro American classics with modern updates. You’ll also find how-to instructions for such staples as rice, beans, and broth, as well as directions for flavor-boosting add-ins to keep in the freezer for fast weeknight cooking from scratch. 

Once you are comfortable with all of the buttons on the Instant Pot, you’ll discover that using it is much like cooking in a pot on the stove. It has settings to sauté and brown (especially useful when starting soups, stews, and braises), to pressure steam (great for getting vegetables done fast), and even to make yogurt. Plus, once a dish has finished cooking, the Instant Pot will keep it warm for up to 10 hours.

I’ve done my best to include a broad array of recipes to please omnivores and vegetarians alike, as well as folks who are staying gluten-free or dairy-free. There are dishes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and for luscious desserts and between-meal snacks. And I’ve tested every recipe in my own kitchen to make sure it is not only foolproof but also delicious. 

When I wrote these recipes, I wanted them to be both intuitive and easy to follow. To make sure I’ve delivered on that goal, I have included clear instructions at every step so you’ll never have to guess which button to press. Decoding the buttons is the main hurdle to learning how to use the Instant Pot, and I’ve eliminated that obstacle in this book. You’re bound to get the hang of things after making just a handful of dishes, and using the Instant Pot will soon be as second nature as stove-top cooking. 



A filling one-pot rice dish with chunks of chicken thigh and slices of spicy andouille sausage, jambalaya is one of my husband’s favorite dishes. It’s easy to throw together for dinner, and I’m happy to make it often, especially when we’re tired of the usual soups and stews. If you like, add seeded and chopped bell pepper and/or celery with the onion. A bottle of hot sauce on the table is mandatory. Frank’s RedHot is my pairing of choice. 

serves 4

1 tablespoon avocado oil or other neutral oil with high smoke point
6 ounces andouille sausage (2 links), sliced
1 yellow onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 cup long-grain white rice
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs (4 thighs), cut into 1-inch pieces

Select the Sauté setting on the Instant Pot and heat the oil. Add the sausage and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for about 3 minutes, until slightly softened. Add the rice, bay leaf, and spices and sauté, stirring often, for 1 minute longer. 

Add the broth, Worcestershire sauce, and chicken and stir to combine, scraping down the sides of the pot to make sure all of the rice is covered with the cooking liquid. 

Secure the lid and set the pressure release to Sealing. Press the Cancel button to reset the cooking program, then select the Poultry setting and set the cooking time for 10 minutes at high pressure. 

Let the pressure release naturally for at least 10 minutes, then move the Pressure Release to Venting to release any remaining steam. Open the pot and serve the jambalaya immediately.

Every recipe you -- or your mother -- ever wanted is here, from pigs in blankets, to Emergency Steak to Chicken Tomato Aspic. Enjoy the clever ideas throughout -- twelve months of birthday cake ideas, showing how to decorate a cake to match each month's gem stone, pointers to make setting up a kitchen easy, or hints to make housework more pleasant. Feel a part of history when making Home Front Macaroni, developed during WW II rationing to stretch meat. Get into the spirit of fun with a Betty Crocker ""Cookie Shine"" or cookie baking party. People who grew up with this book will want it for the memories; those who are new to the book will want it for its charm and its intelligent approach to cooking. It's a perfect keepsake and a great gift.",13232,"Amazon.com Review
First published in 1950, Betty Crocker's Picture Cook Book is now reprinted in all its old-fashioned glory. Betty immerses you in a time when women were homemakers, cakes had at least two layers, and salad was iceberg lettuce. You may hesitate to recreate what your mother or grandmother probably cooked--if so, consider that back then we ate simply, in the days before the word foodie was invented. Many of the recipes suit today's harried lifestyle, as you see in Six Layer Dinner, combining eight cups of vegetables with a pound of ground meat, and Dainty Tea Brownies topped with colorful chopped pistachios.
Hundreds of black-and-white photos, animated drawings, and quaint color spreads of prepared dishes aid you in using the recipes. Beginners learn how to measure ingredients, choose the best economical cuts of meat, and cut up round and sheet cakes for serving. There is even a section on how to set the table. This loose-leaf book contains enough recipes to fill a 12-page, double-column index. Best of all, perhaps, is the ""Shortcut"" section, where useful tips include cleaning a grater of cheese residue by rubbing it with a piece of stale bread. These are interspersed with 15 ways to recuperate from overwork. One suggestion is to lie down on the kitchen floor on your back and relax for three to five minutes. Still a good idea, though few people have a kitchen large enough to try this. --Dana Jacobi

Rule #3: Eat protein at every meal, making some kind of fish your go-to protein as often as you can. Take your weight and divide it by two—that’s more or less how much protein you should be eating in grams every day.
 
Rule #15: Eat at least ten meals a week at home (and cook them yourself). Restaurant portions are usually 40 to 50 percent bigger than what you’d serve at home—the more you eat out, the more you overeat.

Rule #18: Go to bed slightly hungry. Denied fuel for more than five hours, your body will start burning its own fat and sugar. Make a point not to eat after dinner and you’ll be burning fat while you’re sleeping.

RULE 1

DRINK A LARGE GLASS OF WATER BEFORE EVERY MEAL—­NO EXCUSES!

This has got to be the easiest rule there is. Which is a good place to start. But it’s also one of the most important rules there is. You simply must stay hydrated. At a minimum I want you to drink a large glass of water before every meal. But I’d prefer that you drink at least five glasses of water a day, the first one within fifteen minutes of waking.

Now, do I really need to harass you about this? I do. Because during the process of losing weight, nothing is so crucial to your success. Water keeps your organs healthy while you’re sweating, keeps food moving through the system, and makes you feel full.

Let me put this plainly: drinking water helps you lose weight. You can see this most vividly in very overweight children. Recently, a group of Israeli researchers examined the resting energy expenditure (REE) of twenty-­one obese children. REE refers to the rate at which you burn calories when you are sleeping, watching TV, or just simply sitting there and staring into space. The researchers gave the kids a large serving of cold water, then began measuring the REE every 10 minutes. The reaction was more robust than anticipated. Within 24 minutes, REE began increasing. By 57 minutes, REE had increased by 25 percent, and this effect lasted 40 minutes.

Did you get that? Just by drinking water, your body increases its burning of calories. The scientists estimated that, if you just do this, you’ll burn off an extra three pounds over the next year.

That doesn’t sound like a lot, but I’ll take it. Won’t you?

The contestants on The Biggest Loser are usually chronically dehydrated, and their collective experience shows another reason to drink lots of water. They are usually pretty big consumers of salt before they come on the show. They eat it unknowingly—­in the fried and highly processed foods that are their usual mealtime fare and that helped make them so overweight in the first place—­and knowingly; too many of them often add salt to whatever they are served. They are usually eating so much salt that they have begun to mess up the delicate mechanisms of chemical balance so vital to our bodies. When the kidneys are swamped with salt and without adequate liquids, you don’t get enough potassium. That and other minerals are absolutely key to weight loss.

And as my private fitness clients have shown me, drinking more water helps in other physical ways as well. When they start conscientiously drinking lots of water, their workouts improve. They get less muscle fatigue, they recuperate faster, and they don’t feel groggy in the afternoon.

Simple Hydration Tips

Make it your premeal policy: drink a large glass of water before every meal. No excuses.

End the day with preparation for a good start to the next: put a large, full glass of water on your bedstand every night and drink it when you wake up, every morning.

Get a little extra bang for your effort: mix a pitcher of water with a noncaloric vitamin and mineral supplement. I like ElectroMix (one little packet makes a quart), and having the pitcher all mixed and right in front of you will make it that much easier to pour yourself a glass when you open the fridge at every meal; I usually drink mine when I work out.

RULE 2

DON’T DRINK YOUR CALORIES

Caloric beverages steal your health and they steal great food from you. That’s right. They steal it because they are so heavily caloric themselves and will fill you up with all the wrong stuff. Think of the kinds of caloric beverages all around you.

Soft drinks: As you heft one of those cans or buckets of sugar water to your mouth, consider that you are actually eating the equivalent of what should be your entire lunch.

I came to this rule while working on TBL. When I reviewed their pre-­TBL meal plans I saw that most contestants were drinking Big Gulps or other massive jugs of soda that had 500 calories. Some people would nurse several of them during the day (that’s upwards of 1,500 calories of soda a day!). Think of it this way: all that corn syrup? It’s a bushel of corn! And remember, when factory farms want to fatten their cattle, what do they do? They feed them corn. So if you are drinking things with corn syrup, think about that. Are you a cow? No you are not.

Moreover, when you drink soda, you are ingesting what just about every legitimate medical authority in the world has named as suspect number one in today’s sprawling diabetes epidemic. A friend of mine tells me that his teenage kids really got the message a few years ago when their father was diagnosed. Now, when a family member asks for a soda, they cheerily reply: “Sure. What kind of diabetes do you want?”

Out of the mouths of babes.

If, like most Americans, you are used to drinking lots of liquid calories, cutting out soda might be a tough adjustment. But it’s essential that you kick your soda habit ASAP. If you’re a full-­calorie soda drinker, you’re guzzling empty and unsatisfying calories. If you’re a diet/zero-­calorie soda drinker, you haven’t dodged the problem. Hello?! You’re guzzling artificial sweeteners and, as you’ll hear again and again in this book, I don’t think highly of these at all. They only serve to whet your appetite for more sweet! Stop the madness. Kick the habit.

To help wean yourself from your soda habit, start experimenting with other flavored, noncaloric drinks that you can make yourself. Try seltzer water with lime or lemon juice. Stock up on unsweetened, naturally flavored herb teas. Make a quart or so at a time and keep it in the refrigerator to go with your afternoon snack. And there is my tried-­and-­true alternative—­the “soda eliminator” described in Rule 15. Check it out.

Juices and juice drinks: Most juices have exactly the same number of calories—­and the same amount of simple sugars—­as a cola. Oh, you’ll protest, but doesn’t the fiber in a “natural” juice obviate that problem? No. That’s just what you’ve been told. It is the same as drinking a soft drink. You want fruit? Eat fruit. The whole piece of fruit. Not the extracted and manipulated juice.

Yeah, well, juice smoothies are healthy, right? Maybe “healthy” if you order one with no preservatives or added sugar, but regardless, fruit smoothies that you haven’t made yourself (i.e., you have controlled the portions and know exactly what’s gone in it) will make you as fat as a Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade float—­just like a 32-ounce soda.

Energy replacement drinks: Well, yeah—­if you’re training for a marathon. Otherwise, look at the label! A 20-­ounce sports drink—­let’s face it, that’s how much you’ll “need” to quench that big thirst—­weighs in at 130 calories. Like a 12-­ounce cola, but without the nifty zing of bubbles and caffeine. I’ve always seen drinks like these as particularly insidious, because they are, in our heads at least, deeply associated with sports, which are deeply associated with health and fitness. You have to break that connection.

When did he realize he had morphed into un vrai parisien? It might have been when he found himself considering a purchase of men's dress socks with cartoon characters on them. Or perhaps the time he went to a bank with 135 euros in hand to make a 134-euro payment, was told the bank had no change that day, and thought it was completely normal. Or when he found himself dressing up to take out the garbage because he had come to accept that in Paris appearances and image mean everything.

Once you stop laughing, the more than fifty original recipes, for dishes both savory and sweet, such as Pork Loin with Brown Sugar–Bourbon Glaze, Braised Turkey in Beaujolais Nouveau with Prunes, Bacon and Bleu Cheese Cake, Chocolate-Coconut Marshmallows, Chocolate Spice Bread, Lemon-Glazed Madeleines, and Mocha–Crème Fraîche Cake, will have you running to the kitchen for your own taste of Parisian living.",45826,"Review
“David Lebovitz is the greatest thing to happen to dessert since the spoon, but this time he shows that beyond his artful nose and flawless taste, he also has a keen reporter’s eye. If Paris intrigues, excites, or merely interests you, read this book.” —Mort Rosenblum, author of The Secret Life of the Seine, A Goose in Toulouse, Olives, and Chocolate: A Bittersweet Story of Dark and Light

“Cooks aren’t usually such good writers—so funny, skeptical, and observant. He’s a wonderful one. Also, I’m a fervent fan of his ice-cream book, so I can’t wait to cook my way through his other recipes.” —Diane Johnson, author of Le Divorce

Maria Emmerich is a wellness expert in nutrition and exercise physiology. She is the author of several cookbooks and three nutritional guidebooks, including the global bestseller The Ketogenic Cookbook and Quick & Easy Ketogenic Cooking. Maria’s blog, mariamindbodyhealth.com, offers a unique combination of innovative recipes using alternative ingredients to less-healthy options and easy-to-understand explanations of why these options are better for our health.

Maria’s success stems from her passion for helping others reach and sustain optimal health through programs and education that work on a personal level. She understands the connection between food and how it makes us all feel inside and out. Her specialty is brain chemical neurotransmitters and how they are affected by the foods we eat. After struggling with her weight throughout her childhood, she decided to study health and wellness so she could help others who are discouraged by their appearance and do not feel their best. The nutrient-rich, relatively high-fat dietary approach that she developed for herself and the exotic, little-known replacements for typical high-glycemic starchy foods and sugar are what finally gave her total peace with food, something she never imagined possible.","['maria emmerich', 'restaurant favorites', 'easy to follow', 'way of eating', 'low carb', 'every recipe', 'marias books', 'highly recommend', 'feel like', 'keto lifestyle', 'marias cookbooks', 'whole family', 'bourbon chicken', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

I had been drinking fruit and vegetable juices, for a long time. While juices did their job of providing me with good nutrients that are essential for the body, and while juices are good for easy absorption of the nutrients, they do not contain the fiber from the fruit or the vegetable, and I found that I wanted something more substantial and nutritious, but also easy and rapid to prepare.
 
So, I decided that smoothies would be the answer; but not just any smoothie but smoothies made from the Nutribullet. I bought a Nutribullet and it does the job for me. One of the best things I liked about this blender is that it is compact and does not occupy much space, making it ideal for my kitchen; which is small and compact. Making smoothies with the Nutribullet is a quick and simple feat. What about washing the Nutribullet after I'm all done? It can be done in a jiffy, with no pulp or mess to deal with. Pretty sleek, don't you think?
 
I simply love the Nutribullet, for it allows me to whip a healthy breakfast, packed full of nutrition, in a very short time. Washing the cup and blade is equally simple and fast and there is no waste as there is when juicing fruits and vegetables.

In her hit Food Network show Everyday Italian, Giada De Laurentiis shows you how to cook delicious, beautiful food in a flash. And here, in her long-awaited first book, she does the same—helps you put a fabulous dinner on the table tonight, for friends or just for the kids, with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of flavor. She makes it all look easy, because it is.

Everyday Italian is true to its title: the fresh, simple recipes are incredibly quick and accessible, and also utterly mouth-watering—perfect for everyday cooking. And the book is focused on the real-life considerations of what you actually have in your refrigerator and pantry (no mail-order ingredients here) and what you’re in the mood for—whether a simply sauced pasta or a hearty family-friendly roast, these great recipes cover every contingency. So, for example, you’ll find dishes that you can make solely from pantry ingredients, or those that transform lowly leftovers into exquisite entrées (including brilliant ideas for leftover pasta), and those that satisfy your yearning to have something sweet baking in the oven. There are 7 ways to make red sauce more interesting, 6 different preparations of the classic cutlet, 5 perfect pestos, 4 creative uses for prosciutto, 3 variations on basic polenta, 2 great steaks, and 1 sublime chocolate tiramisù—plus 100 other recipes that turn everyday ingredients into speedy but special dinners.

With its cover image of the fetching de Laurentiis wearing a low-cut top and its promise of easy, tasty Italian recipes, this cookbook is sure to draw in home cooks who don't know how to make a basic marinara sauce and want to be introduced them to the beauty and simplicity of Italian cuisine. Which is, of course, a good thing, but a shame, too, since this work lacks depth or meaning. Readers seeking a true introduction to the building blocks of Italian cooking would be worlds better off with one of Marcella Hazan's or Lidia Bastianich's early primers. What those who are lured in by the good looks and charm of de Laurentiis (granddaughter of film producer Dino and star of Food Network's Everyday Italian) will get is an unsophisticated but decent selection of Italian-American classics, from antipasto to pasta, meat dishes to desserts, including Clams Oreganata, Caprese Salad, Salsa all'Amatriciana, Fettucine Alfredo, Veal Marsala, Caponata and Chocolate Tiramisù. De Laurentiis provides an introduction to each dish, and her recipes are generally minimalist (there are no recipes for homemade pastas or stews that take a day to make). Though bursting with glamorous shots of a lovely looking author, this is a rather flat first effort.

Featured Recipe: No Cream-No Cry Penne Alla Vodka

The dirty little secret about Penne alla Vodka is not the vodka but the hefty amount of heavy cream. Vodka is colorless, odorless, and without much flavor—not really attributes of a superstar ingredient. It’s the combination of cream and tomato sauce that gives this dish its signature flavor. The traditional cream is swapped here for low-fat Greek yogurt. --Rocco DiSpirito
Ingredients
8 ounces whole- wheat penne
2 cups Rocco’s How Low Can You Go Low-Fat Marinara Sauce (page 206 of Now Eat This!) or store-bought low- fat marinara sauce
Pinch of crushed red pepper
One 7-ounce container 2% Greek yogurt
1 cup chopped fresh basil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
6 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
(Serves 4)
Directions

This dish isn’t a makeover, per se. But there are so many beloved--and believe it or not, unhealthy--seared tuna dishes out there in the restaurant world that I thought I should offer at least one healthy version. The tuna is never the problem. Tuna is rich in nutrients, low in fat, delicious, and just a good bet all around. It’s the stuff that’s put on top that’s the problem--anything from seared foie gras to deep-fried tempura crispies. Sure, it tastes great, but those additions turn a healthful dish into an artery-clogging one.Read more
From Booklist
Popular television chef DiSpirito’s latest cookbook retools diet cookery in hope of convincing even the most stubborn gourmand to cut calories yet still maintain a regimen of delicious, satisfying foods not immediately perceived as diet food. To accomplish this, he takes up underused ingredients such as Greek yogurt, whole-wheat pasta, cauliflower, and reduced-sugar ketchup, whose benefits go beyond mere calorie trimming to add fiber and enhance nutrition. DiSpirito’s goal is to reduce calories in popular “comfort foods” to less than 350 per serving, and his methods yield some astonishing calorie reductions. Onion rings fall from about 1,800 calories to 342. Fried chicken loses more than half. In addition to building in lower fats, DiSpirito does his best to lower cholesterol, carbohydrate, and sodium levels as well. The frustrated gourmet compelled to address weight loss will thrill to DiSpirito’s novel approach, but it requires thorough pantry restocking. --Mark Knoblauch

From beloved food personality Bobby Deen, son of Paula Deen, comes an irresistible new cookbook featuring 120 recipes of Southern comfort-food classics—all under 350 calories and jam-packed with flavor.
 
Raised on his mother’s fried chicken and hoecakes, Bobby Deen ultimately found himself, as a young man, twenty-five pounds overweight. Unwilling to sacrifice any of his favorite foods, Bobby started tweaking the recipes he grew up on, replacing sour cream with nonfat yogurt, using lower-calorie versions of mayonnaise, cream cheese, and other high-calorie items. Even Paula herself sometimes couldn’t tell the difference between the lo-cal versions and her originals—since the flavor remained top-notch.
 
Here you’ll find a soup-to-nuts collection of many of the great dishes and flavors you’ve come to enjoy and expect from the Deens, but with a lot fewer calories. Every recipe has been reviewed and approved by a certified nutritionist. Yes, you can have your Gooey Less Butter Cake and eat it too . . . along with such selections as
 
It’s a Party Guacamole • Easy Ginger-Glazed Spare Ribs • Yes You Can Mac and Cheese • Cheeseburger Casserole • Old-Fashioned Meatloaf • Crispy Oven-Fried Chicken • Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Apples • Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes • Bittersweet Chocolate Cheesecake • Strawberry Streusel Cake
 
In addition to all these mouthwatering recipes and 65 full-color photos, you will find before/after fat and calorie counts (so you know just how many calories you’re saving)—plus a week’s worth of 1,500 calorie/day menus, celebration menus, healthy prep tips, weight-loss shortcuts, ideas for stocking a healthy pantry/fridge, and a section on easy high-fat/low-fat ingredient swaps.

His tasty food stresses eating healthier without sacrificing the delicious Southern flavors and traditions he grew up with! Way to go Bobby!”—Pat and Gina Neely, hosts of Down Home with the Neelys

Whether grow-your-own, bought locally from a farmer's market, or fresh from a regular supermarket, seasonality still affects the quality, abundance and price of good food. It just makes sense to preserve food quality for those times when it's not as plentiful or not available at all. Dehydrating food with this terrific book is easy and creates tasty food year-round.
Incorporating the age-old practices of food dehydration takes full advantage of what nature offers. All the wonderful recipes are still here and there is a bonus section on everything from pet treats to crafts and homemade gifts. What has changed is that the ""Everything You Need to Know About Dehydrating Foods"" section has been expanded to include even more comprehensive and complete information about dehydrating foods along with even more tips and techniques.
There are more than 150 recipes for dehydrating everything from herbs and seasonings to fruits, vegetables, meats and fish, plus more than 250 delicious recipes that actually use the dehydrated foods as ingredients. Putting home-preserved food to work for home, RV, boat or campsite has never been easier.
The easy-to-follow drying instructions along with time guidelines make even a novice cook feel like a seasoned professional.
Planting a few extra rows of tomatoes or beans, picking many strawberries at their peak or buying that big basket of freshly harvested carrots can really pay off later. Loading up the dehydrator will provide personally dried foods the whole year through.",19046,"Review
This one's an encyclopedia. It's a good resource for recipes on the spot but may be overwhelming if you`re starting out. I like to have it on the shelf in case I'm looking to expand ideas but it`s recipes are so literal (an advantage to many) that I prefer to use this to brainstorm my own ideas from rather than to use it each piece. This could apply to all levels of home preservers but I like it best as an on-demand reference as opposed to a manual. (Well Preserved wellpreserved.ca 2011-04-25)

Dehydrating is one of the most effective ways to preserve food for maximun nutrition at a very low cost. The Dehydrator Bible recognizes that cooking is a blend of science and art. Co-authors Jennifer MacKenize, Jay Nutt and Don Mercer combined their professional expertise to take the guesswork out of drying a variety of foods, and sharing successful techniques and recipes.

With a searchable DVD demonstrating every technique a cook will ever need.

In his more than sixty years as a chef, Jacques Pépin has earned a reputation as a champion of simplicity. His recipes are classics. They find the shortest, surest route to flavor, avoiding complicated techniques.

Now, in a book that celebrates his life in food, the world’s most famous cooking teacher winnows his favorite recipes from the thousands he has created, streamlining them even further. They include Onion Soup Lyonnaise-Style, which Jacques enjoyed as a young chef while bar-crawling in Paris; Linguine with Clam Sauce and Vegetables, a frequent dinner chez Jacques; Grilled Chicken with Tarragon Butter, which he makes indoors in winter and outdoors in summer; Five-Peppercorn Steak, his spin on a bistro classic; Mémé’s Apple Tart, which his mother made every day in her Lyon restaurant; and Warm Chocolate Fondue Soufflé, part cake, part pudding, part soufflé, and pure bliss.

Essential Pépin spans the many styles of Jacques’s cooking: homey country French, haute cuisine, fast food Jacques-style, and fresh contemporary American dishes. Many of the recipes are globally inspired, from Mexico, across Europe, or the Far East.

In the accompanying searchable DVD, Jacques shines as a teacher, as he demonstrates all the techniques a cook needs to know. This truly is the essential Pépin.

Fall into Cooking Featured Recipe from Jacques Pepin’s Essential Pepin
When the weather gets cooler in the fall, I make soup. I generally cook up a big batch and freeze some for whenever I need it. This one, with sausage, potatoes, and cabbage, is hearty and good for cold weather. It’s terrific served with thick slices of country bread, and if you have a salad as well, you’ve got a complete dinner.
Sausage, Potato, and Cabbage Soup
Serves 8
Ingredients
8 ounces mild Italian sausage meat
2 small onions, cut into 1-inch-thick slices (1 ½ cups)

""A must-have for any cookbook fan.""
--Edward Ash Millby for USA Today
""...simple without being dumbed down; approachable yet still adventurous... Whether he's explaining how to make Escoffier quenelles with mushroom sauce, black sea bass gravlax...or tarte tatin, [Pepin] makes it seem doable and shares tidbits of wisdom to boost confidence and kitchen knowledge... For serious cooks and beginners alike, this is an instant classic that would enhance almost any collection.""
-Publishers Weekly, starred
""Jacques Pépin has been a constant inspiration to me. This book is a distillation of the very best of his creations, showing both the remarkable breadth of his cooking and the beautiful continuity of his dishes over the past sixty years. He makes food the way it should be made: Simple, seasonally ripe, pure, and impossible to resist.""
—Alice Waters
""Jacques Pepin is The Master. The undisputed authority on . . . well, just about everything relating to food. If Jacques Pepin tells you this is the way to make an omelet — or to roast a chicken, then for me, the matter is settled. As with all his works, this is a vital, essential volume that should live in your kitchen forever. Nobody knows more or does it better.""

""If there's a 'best of the best' in cookbooks, this is it--a lifetime of greatest hits from our favorite ambassador of French cuisine. These recipes are more than just mouthwatering; they are as lively, unpretentious, and appealing as the man behind them, reminding us (as if we needed reminding) why we fell in love with French food, and with Jacques Pépin, in the first place. An essential collection from an essential chef.""

""Jacques Pepin is a true artist and a masterful one at that. His commitment to excellence and dedication to quality education are evident throughout his storied career. , and we, his pupils, are ever so fortunate to benefit from the breadth of knowledge within its pages.

5 Questions for Mark Bittman

Q. What motivated you to write a comprehensive cookbook of vegetarian recipes right now?
A: What motivated me--several years ago--was seeing the handwriting on the wall: That although being a principled, all-or-nothing vegetarian was not a course of action that would ever likely inspire the majority of Americans, the days of all-meat-all-the-time (or, to be slightly less extreme, of a diet heavily dependent on meat) could not go on. Averaging a consumption of two pounds a week or more of meat (as Americans do) is not sustainable, either for the earth or our planet. And, as more and more of us realize this, I thought it was important to develop a cookbook along the lines of How to Cook Everything, but without meat, fish, or poultry. Needless to say, there’s plenty of material.

From Publishers Weekly
Starred Review. Marking how mainstream vegetarian cooking has become, the next must-have for the vegetarian cook's shelf comes from New York Times Minimalist chef Bittman, an avowed meat eater. And that ensures one of this massive compendium's many attractions: a wealth of recipes that don't scream vegetarian and plentiful guidelines to make cooking vegetarian as intuitive as cooking with meat. Like his now classic How to Cook Everything, this book opens with terrifically useful, straightforward discussions of essential ingredients, appliances and techniques, which Bittman builds on throughout in to-the-point sidebars and illustrated boxes. The recipes flow thick and fast in his theme-and-variations style: Green Tea with Udon Noodles is followed by concise instructions for making it 17 different ways, while Coconut Rice gets five additional takes and Kidney Beans with Apples and Sherry four; other lists (six Great Spreads for Bruschetta or Crostini, 10 Garnishes for Pozole with Mole) abound and inspire. New vegetarians and vegetarians cooking for omnivores will appreciate Bittman's avoidance of faux meat products in favor of flavorful high-protein dishes like Braised Tofu in Caramel Sauce and Bechamel Burgers with Nuts. Even owners of the original book will find much new to savor while benefiting from Bittman's remarkable ability to teach foundational skills and encourage innovation with them, which will help even longtime vegetarians freshen their repertory.

A guide to all kinds of addiction from a star who has struggled with heroin, alcohol, sex, fame, food, and eBay, that will help addicts and their loved ones make the first steps into recovery.
""This manual for self-realization comes not from a mountain but from the mud.... My qualification is not that I am better than you but I am worse."" (Russell Brand)
With a rare mix of honesty, humor, and compassion, comedian and movie star Russell Brand mines his own wild story and shares the advice and wisdom he has gained through his 14 years of recovery. Brand speaks to those suffering along the full spectrum of addiction - from drugs, alcohol, caffeine, and sugar addictions to addictions to work, stress, bad relationships, digital media, and fame. Brand understands that addiction can take many shapes and sizes and how the process of staying clean, sane, and unhooked is a daily activity. He believes that the question is not ""why are you addicted?"" but ""what pain is your addiction masking? Why are you running - into the wrong job, the wrong life, the wrong person's arms?""
Russell has been in all the 12-step fellowships going, he's started his own men's group, he's a therapy regular and a practiced yogi - and while he's worked on this material as part of his comedy and previous best sellers, he's never before shared the tools that really took him out of it, that keep him clean and clear.

William Menzin M.D. (Foreword)",4.4,517,4.99,4.3,,"Everyone knows they need to eat more fruits and vegetables, but consuming even the minimum FDA-recommended five servings a day can be challenging. In Green for Life, raw foods pioneer Victoria Boutenko presents an overlooked powerhouse of nutrition in this equation: greens. For their bounty of minerals and nutrients, greens exceed other vegetables in value. Green for Life details the immense health benefits of greens and suggests an easy way to consume them in sufficient quantities: the green smoothie. This quick, simple drink benefits everyone, regardless of lifestyle, diet, or environment. Green smoothies eliminate toxins, correct nutritional deficiencies, and are delicious as well.

Green for Life includes the latest information on the abundance of protein in greens, the benefits of fiber, the role of greens in homeostasis, the significance of stomach acid, how greens make the body more alkaline, the healing power of chlorophyll, and more. Also included are the results of a pilot study demonstrating the effectiveness of adding just one quart of green smoothies a day to one’s diet, without changing anything else in dietary intake. Green smoothie testimonials and recipes give readers confidence and motivation in exploring green smoothies for themselves. This updated edition offers important new research on the role that omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids play in metabolic health and includes nutritional data on select green smoothies and updated findings on organic versus conventional produce. Offering more in-depth nutritional and experiential information than Boutenko’s recently released Green Smoothie Revolution, Green for Life makes an ideal companion piece to its recipe-rich successor.",132132,"Review

—Midwest Book Review

“In more than thirty-five years of practice as a psychiatrist affiliated with the Harvard Medical School, I have learned one thing very well: Human behavior is very hard to change. Now Victoria Boutenko is persuading me otherwise. … Thirty days of green smoothies will change how you feel, and how you feel about yourself. That’s no small achievement for one small book.”
—A. William Menzin, MD, Harvard Medical School, from the foreword

“Victoria Boutenko’s clear, simple, masterful concept is so valuable, so powerful—we can expect to see and feel the world of health rocked to its foundations within the decade.”

—Dr. Ruza Bodganovich, internationally renowned lecturer and author of The Cure is in the Cause

“Raw food expert Victoria Boutenko wants you to eat more leafy greens, but she knows chomping on big bunches of them can be difficult. So, in the second edition of her book , originally published in 2005, she instead recommends blending kale, spinach, chard, and the like with different fruits and vegetables and drinking a quart of the resulting green smoothie every day... Already own the book? The new version includes nutritional information on Boutenko's favorite edible weeds (stinging nettles, dandelions, lambsquarters); testimonials from smoothie converts, who marvel at how their various ailments disappear after going green; and some 20 additional recipes for smoothies and puddings, which Boutenko perfected over six years of experimentation.”

is the book that makes the case, the proof, if you will, that green smoothies are the missing link in human nutrition… After you read the science and the amazing testimonials, you'll be itching to make your first smoothie… Few books are as ‘must-have’ as this one… 10+ out of 10.”

“Amazing and inspiring... is impossible to read without craving a fresh, green smoothie. Why? The information and stories in the book (including dozens of first person experiences from those who changed their diets after reading the first edition of ) are compelling, even shocking, and offer the promise of healing for any of us with health and skin issues... pick up this influential book and start getting greens into your daily routine!”

As a nutrition professional I frequently discover new diets and eating habits.  Many claim to offer optimal health or weight loss, disease control or the next thing. I find myself reading diet books with a certain skepticism… [Victoria Boutenko’s] research finds many benefits to adding green smoothies to the daily diet... I highly recommend reading [], and trying the smoothies, to anyone.  If your health is declining, your weight is increasing or decreasing unexpectedly, or if you would like overall health benefits of amazing greens…read this book!”
—Rachel Fox, RD,

“[ offers] background, logistics, health information, facts, and even a short study with people trying out the smoothie lifestyle. I thoroughly enjoyed this book! ... I noticed a difference in myself after only one day drinking the smoothies. That shocked me. I felt so betrayed by my own desires of wanting 'regular' food. I felt more energized, didn't need as much sleep the night afterward, and could tell my digestion was better… I'm glad to know there's an easy way to add greens and fruits to my diet… helpful and informative.”
Kari,

“[Boutenko] makes it clear throughout [] that consuming vitamin-packed smoothies is not only the most effective way for our bodies to absorb essential nutrients, adding just one quart of green smoothie a day to one's diet can help with everything from weight loss and cravings, to healing skin conditions and reversing diabetes. She literally has pages and pages of inspiring testimonials, which is helpful for us as readers since we can pinpoint our trouble spot and then look through the book for a way to tackle it with the help of greens.”

“A good beginner's guide that is ripe for discussion.”

It’s Sheet Pan Suppers—a breakthrough full-color cookbook with more than 120 recipes for complete meals, snacks, brunch, and even dessert, that require nothing more than a sheet pan, your oven, and Molly Gilbert’s inspired approach.

The virtue of cooking on a sheet pan is two-fold. First there’s the convenience of cooking everything together and having just one pan to clean up. Then there’s the cooking method—roasting, baking, or broiling—three techniques that intensify flavors; in other words, food tastes better when cooked on a sheet pan (move over, slow cooker). But the real genius here is Molly Gilbert’s fresh, sophisticated approach. There are easy dinners for weeknight meals—Chicken Legs with Fennel and Orange; Soy-Mustard Salmon and Broccoli; Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Squash, Apples, and Onions. Special occasion meals—Rack of Lamb with Herby Bread Crumbs and Buttered Carrots; Asparagus and Black Cod in Parchment. Meatless meals—Israeli Couscous-Stuffed Peppers. Plus surprise extras, including in-a-snap party snacks—Baked Brie and Strawberries, Corn and Crab Cakes with Yogurt Aioli; quick brunch dishes like Greens and Eggs and Ham, and Baked Apricot French Toast; and, of course, dessert—Stone Fruit Slab Pie, Halloween Candy S’mores.

Originally published in 1896 as The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book by Fannie Merritt Farmer, it became the coobook that taught generations of Americans how to cook. Completely updating it for the first time since 1979, Marion Cunningham made Fannie Farmer once again a household word for a new generation of cooks.

What makes this basic cookbook so distinctive is that Marion Cunningham, who is the personification of the nineteenth-century teacher, is always at your side with her forthright tips and comments, encouraging the beginning cook and inspiring the more adventurous. She knows what today's cooks are looking for, and she has a way of instilling confidence and joy in the act of cooking.

In giving the book new life, Mrs. Cunningham has been careful always to preserve the best of the old. She has retained all the particularly good, tried-and-true recipes from preceding editions, retesting and rewriting when necessary. She has rediscovered lost treasures, including delicious recipes that were eliminated when practically no one baked bread at home. This is now the place to find the finest possible recipes for Pumpkin Soup, Boston Baked Beans, Carpetbag Steak, Roast Stuffed Turkey, Anadama Bread, Indian Pudding, Apple Pie, and all of the other traditional favorites.

The new recipes reflect ethnic influences—Mediterranean, Moroccan, Asian—that have been adding their flavors to American cooking in recent years. Tucked in among all your favorites like Old-Fashioned Beef Stew, New England Clam Chowder, Ham Timbales, and Chicken Jambalaya, you'll find her cool Cucumber Sushi, Enchiladas with Chicken and Green Sauce, or a layered dish of Polenta and Fish to add variety to your repertoire. Always a champion of old-fashioned breakfasts and delectable desserts, Mrs. Cunningham has many splendid new offerings to tempt you.

Throughout, cooking terms and procedures are explained, essential ingredients are spelled out, basic equipment is assessed. Mrs. Cunningham even tells you how to make a good cup of coffee and how to brew tea properly.

For the diet-conscious, there is an expanded nutritional chart that includes a breakdown of cholesterol and fat in common ingredients as well as in Fannie Farmer basic recipes. Where the taste of a dish would not be altered, Mrs. Cunningham has reduced the amount of cream and butter in some of the recipes from the preceding edition. She carefully evaluates the issues of food safety today and alerts us to potential hazards.

But the emphasis here is always on good flavor, fresh ingredients, and lots of variety in one's daily fare, which Marion Cunningham believes is the secret to a healthy diet. Dedicated to the home cooks of America, young and old, this thirteenth edition of the book that won the hearts of Americans more than a century ago invites us all—as did the original Fannie Farmer—to cherish the delights of the family table.",21468,"Amazon.com Review
Marion Cunningham's brilliant revision of this classic home cooking reference addresses ""good everyday cooking."" Cunningham states that ""every meal should be a small celebration,"" and she eases the preparation of those celebrations with clear, straightforward instructions and hints on how to make the most of every meal through beautiful presentation and balanced nutrition. The chapter on microwaved foods is clear and presents recipes that are simple and taste great. Cunningham's work especially shines in the chapters on baking, as might be expected from her work on The Fannie Farmer Baking Book and The Breakfast Book. Your piecrusts will always be crisp and flaky under her tutelage.

The Cancer-Fighting Kitchen features 150 science-based, nutrient-rich recipes that are easy to prepare and designed to give patients a much-needed boost by stimulating appetite and addressing treatment side effects including fatigue, nausea, dehydration, mouth and throat soreness, tastebud changes, and weight loss. A step-by-step guide helps patients nutritionally prepare for all phases of treatment, and a full nutritional analysis accompanies each recipe. This remarkable resource teaches patients and caregivers how to use readily available powerhouse ingredients to build a symptom- and cancer-fighting culinary toolkit. Blending fantastic taste and meticulous science, these recipes for soups, vegetable dishes, proteins, and sweet and savory snacks are rich in the nutrients, minerals, and phytochemicals that help patients thrive during treatment.

Whole foods, big-flavor ingredients, and attractive presentations round out the customized menu plans that have been specially formulated for specific treatment phases, cancer types, side effects, and flavor preferences. The Cancer-Fighting Kitchen brings the healing power of delicious, nutritious foods to those whose hearts and bodies crave a revitalizing meal.

Starred Review. Cancer treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation can be almost as hard on the body as the disease itself, and detailed nutrition advice is usually not on the program. This informative guide to fighting cancer from the inside out, from the senior chief at Marin County's Commonweal Cancer Help Program, corrects that with a wealth of easy, immediate steps to speed up the healing process through diet. The duo offer advice on treatment prep as well as solutions to common side effects like dehydration, fatigue and nausea. Caregivers should scour the first third, which describes in detail the treatment process, and includes an alphabetical list of cancer-fighting ingredients like blueberries, chocolate, honey and salmon, a reference for the 150 recipes that follow. Recipes for soups, broths and simple, satisfying dishes like Chicken and Rice are welcome, but the text is most helpful for an array of quick, nutritious snacks, like nutrient-rich granola bars or a cooling Cantaloupe Granita with Mint (especially useful for cravings, which are also addressed). Katz's experience with cancer patients and their long, often frustrating recovery lends authority to her wise, common-sense approach, suitable for cooks of all skill levels.

Recipe Excerpts from How to Cook Everything The Basics


It's actually been almost 14 years since the first edition, which I can hardly believe myself. For me, there's a big difference between how I think about ""food"" and how I approach writing cookbooks. In fact, the way I write cookbooks has barely changed: I try to write simple, straightforward recipes that encourage people to cook rather than wow or intimidate them. These are cookbooks for people who cook or want to learn how to cook. In terms of thinking about food, see the next question.


It's a huge change but I haven't left much behind; I'm still writing about cooking not only for the but for others. The Opinion writing gives me a chance to say what I think not only about cooking but about food, about eating. And what I think is that although cooking goes a long way to helping us eat better, there are many, many issues that cooking can't address, important issues to anyone who eats--which is everyone.


No. I think that the books about lifestyle and trends in restaurant food are not cookbooks. , modesty aside, is the epitome of a cookbook: It's a book that teaches how to cook. It'll be trendy for some people and not for others, like everything else.


The basic books of the '60s and '70s, which were those by Jim Beard; Julia Child; Paula Peck; Craig Claiborne; and a few others. And of course .

Followers of the diet have been asking Dr. Agatston for more recipes that are delicious, healthy, and fast, so he's created The South Beach Diet Quick and Easy Cookbook.

Our time-strapped culture needs an effective plan for eating healthy meals at home again. Dr. Agatston delivers with 200 brand-new recipes that use 10 or fewer ingredients and require 30 minutes or less of cooking time. The cookbook offers a diverse range of healthy, easy dishes in all categories, including 25 all-new chef recipes from Miami-area restaurants. There are no more excuses for not joining the many others that have made the South Beach Diet work for them.

The sound advice readers count on from the South Beach Diet name are still featured. The book provides practical timesaving tips and advice for how to eat well while staying on the plan. Also, phase designations and nutritional information are listed along with each recipe, so you're in control of what you're eating. Illustrated throughout with full-color photography, The South Beach Diet Quick and Easy Cookbook is for believers and newcomers alike.",8475,"From Publishers Weekly
The 30-minute time limit for preparing dinner, popular with Rachael Ray and a host of other cookbook authors, has finally been South Beachified. It's just in time for dieters who've grown bored (or impatient) with The South Beach Diet Cookbook and offers easy recipes that help dieters stay on track. The recipes span all courses, including desserts. Most impressive are the entrées and salads, particularly in their ability to riff on familiar dishes: witness Spaghetti with White Clam Sauce, Chicken and Avocado Salad, and South Beach Classic Burger. Even more inventive fare, such as Thai Shrimp Soup with Lime and Cilantro, is still homey. Adding to the book's unthreatening feel is its idiosyncrasies. It favors certain spices (cilantro, black pepper), vegetables (asparagus, zucchini) and meats and fish (chicken and shrimp). The ingredient glossary is surprisingly enticing, and the introductory material explains modern eating habits and makes the South Beach Diet highly sensible. Photos. (Oct.)

When Kristin Kimball left New York City to interview a dynamic young farmer named Mark, her world changed. On an impulse, she shed her city self and started a new farm with him on five hundred acres near Lake Champlain. The Dirty Life is the captivating chronicle of the couple’s first year on Essex Farm, from the cold North Country winter through their harvest-season wedding in the loft of the barn.

Kristin and Mark’s plan to grow everything needed to feed a community was an ambitious idea, and a bit romantic. It worked. Every Friday evening, all year round, over a hundred people travel to Essex Farm to pick up their weekly share of the “whole diet”—beef, pork, chicken, milk, eggs, maple syrup, grains, flours, dried beans, herbs, fruits, and forty different vegetables—produced by the farm. In The Dirty Life, Kristin discovers the wrenching pleasures of physical work, learns that good food is at the center of a good life, falls deeply in love, and finally finds the engagement and commitment she craved in the form of a man, a small town, and a beautiful piece of land.",22245,"Review
“The Dirty Life is a delightful, tumultuous, and tender story of the author's love affair with the man who becomes her husband and the farm they work together to restore. With wisdom and humor, Kristin Kimball describes how she abandoned her career in New York City, leaving behind everything she thought was important for a hard, distinctly unglamorous existence that turns out to be the most fulfilling thing she’s ever done.”
—Jeannette Walls, author of Half Broke Horses and The Glass Castle

""The Dirty Life is a wonderfully told tale of one of the most interesting farms in the country. If you want to understand the heart and soul of the new/old movement towards local food, this is the book you need. It's the voice of what comes next in this land, of the generation unleashed by Wendell Berry to do something really grand.”
—Bill McKibben, author Eaarth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet

""The truest, most hilarious, and most affirming story of a beginning farmer that you could possibly find.""
—Barbara Damrosch, The Washington Post

""Kimball is a graceful, luminous writer with an eye for detail . . . How lucky we are to be able to step into that world with no sweat. I wished for a hundred pages more.""
—Minneapolis Star Tribune

""Kimball writes in vivid but unsentimental language, equal parts dirt and poetry.""
—Burlington Free Press

""In her beguiling memoir, Kimball describes the complex truth about the simple life in prose that is observant and lyrical, yet tempered by a farmer's lack of sentimentality.""
—

""As Kimball chronicles that first year in supple prose, the farm takes on vivid form, with the frustrations balancing the satisfactions and the dark complementing the light. Throughout the book, the author ably describes the various trials and tribulations involved... A hearty, chromatic account of a meaningful accomplishment in farming.""

She’s out to prove that Mexican home cooking is quicker and far easier than most Americans think.

Her dishes are not blanketed with cheese, or heavy and fried, or based on complex sauces. Nor are they necessarily highly spicy. Surprising in their simplicity and freshness, they incorporate produce and grains. Most important, they fit perfectly into an everyday family cooking schedule and use just a handful of ingredients, most of which are already in your pantry. Many are homey specialties that Pati learned from her mother and grandmother, some are creative spins on classics, while others are not well known outside of Mexico.

Dishes like Chicken à la Trash (it’s delicious!), a one-pot meal that Pati gleaned from a Mexican restaurant cook; Mexican Meatballs with Mint and Chipotle; Sweet and Salty Salmon; and Mexican-Style Pasta can revitalize your daily repertoire. You’ll find plenty of vegetarian fare, from Classic Avocado Soup, to Divorced Eggs (with red and green salsa), to Oaxaca-Style Mushroom and Cheese Quesadillas.

Your friends and family will enjoy Tomato and Mozzarella Salad with Pickled Ancho Chile Vinaigrette; Crab Cakes with Jalapeño Aioli; and Chicken Tinga — (you can use rotisserie chicken), which makes a tasty filling for tortas and tostadas. Pati also shares exciting dishes for the holidays and other special occasions, including Mexican Thanksgiving Turkey with Chorizo, Pecan, Apple, and Corn Bread Stuffing; Spiral-Cut Beef Tenderloin; and Red Pozole (“a Mexican party in a bowl”), which she served on her wedding day. Desserts like Triple Orange Mexican Wedding Cookies, Scribble Cookies (sandwich cookies filled with chocolate), and little Apricot-Lime Glazed Mini Pound Cakes are sophisticated yet simple to make.",14022,"Review

  ""Pati Jinich is a breath of fresh air in the food world. She's warm, beyond smart, she's funny and a generous and gifted cook. She knows Mexican food as her heritage and as a scholar, but knows, too, the realities of being a working mother. She never gave up on the tastes she grew up with, but she's got an uncanny way of streamlining how she recreates them. This is one of those books you'll be cooking and learning from for a long time.""

  ""Pati Jinich has created the most delicious guidebook to the magnificent market-driven home cooking of Mexico that I've ever seen.

""Of all the kids' cooking books that have crossed my threshold over the years, this is the one that seems to have struck gold. I usually hand kids' cookbooks to my daughter (she's 9 now) for a first opinion before looking at them myself; this one I never got back. Cooking Class, written by family-magazine editor and kids'-cooking specialist Deanna Cook, seems to know how to talk directly to kids (or at least bookish kids who are seriously motivated to feed themselves) with minimal interference from parents. Part of the appeal is that it's such an intensely visual book, full of colorful pages, punchy graphics and clear instructions. It's got peel-off labels for your homemade dressings (because even a kid independent enough to cook for herself is still a kid, and hence not immune to the charm of stickers). It's got pictures of other kids cooking by themselves. And now, our copy's got stains and sticky spots — sure signs of devotion no matter what the cook's age."" — T. Susan Chang, NPR

“An appealing blend of fun techniques (flowers made of fruit, anyone?) and practical recipes (omelets, apple crisp) make former FamilyFun editor Deanna F. Cook’s new book, Cooking Class, a must-have for any budding chef. The recipe variations and open-ended projects let kids take their culinary creativity to the next level.” — FamilyFun
 ""There comes a time, kids, when you've got to expand your kitchen repertoire beyond mac 'n cheese, hot dogs, and PB&J. French Toast on a Stick, Quiche Cupcakes, Tiny Tomato Toast, and Lettuce Roll-Ups are so much more interesting and healthy, especially when you've made them all by yourself. No matter what you want to cook, this book has you covered, with helpful photos, easy-to-follow instructions, and quirky twists on recipes."" —

Review
“David Lebovitz is a rare specimen: both a terrific storyteller and a brilliant, uncompromising recipe writer. His lighthearted, almost satirical style is combined with far-reaching knowledge of food and its context. I’d follow him blindfolded on this journey to the City of Light.” 
-Yotam Ottolenghi, coauthor of Jerusalem
 
“David Lebovitz is a chef who can write better than most food writers, a writer who can hold his own in any restaurant kitchen in the world, and, most of all, a guy who simply rejoices in food and cooking. This may be his most personal cookbook, describing all facets of his cooking life in Paris, with great stories, information, and recipes. I need two copies of this book: one for the kitchen and another by my reading chair.” 
-Michael Ruhlman, author of Ruhlman’s Twenty
 
“Opening this beautiful book is like opening the door to David’s Paris. Of course, you get great recipes, but you also get to wander the world’s most delicious city with a friend who knows it well and is excited to share it with you. A treat for those of us who love French home cooking, Paris, and David’s take on it all.” 
-Dorie Greenspan, author of Around My French Table
 
“David Lebovitz is the ultimate American in Paris and this book is the ultimate insight into his beautiful and delicious world. I am beyond jealous!” 
-Suzanne Goin, author of The A.O.C. Cookbook

 In My Paris Kitchen, Lebovitz weaves together inviting and insightful tales about his adopted city with a collection of smart, fun recipes. Some of these are total French classics—think oeufs mayo and green lentil salad—while others give a nod to the ethnic diversity in the city. In a nod to his pastry background, Lebovitz includes a substantial dessert section, but it's clear from the breadth of the book that his Paris kitchen is filled with so much more than sweets. Here is a cookbook to take to a comfy chair and read cover to cover.

Baby-Led Weaning explodes the myth that babies need to be spoon-fed and shows why self-feeding from the start of the weaning process is the healthiest way for your child to develop. With baby-led weaning (BLW, for short), you can skip purées and make the transition to solid food by following your baby’s cues.
At about six months, most babies are ready to join the family at the kitchen table and discover food for themselves. Baby-Led Weaning is the definitive guide to this crucial period in your child’s development, and shows you how to help your baby:
Participate in family meals right from the start
Experiment with food at his or her own pace
Develop new abilities, including hand-eye coordination and chewing
Learn to love a variety of foods and to enjoy mealtimes
Baby-led weaning became a parenting phenomenon in the UK practically overnight, inspiring a fast-growing and now international online community of parents who practice baby-led weaning—with blogs and pictures to prove it! In Baby-Led Weaning, world-leading BLW authority Gill Rapley and early BLW practitioner and coauthor Tracey Murkett deliver everything you need to know about raising healthy, confident eaters.",18530,"Review
STARRED REVIEW—""Nurse Rapley and freelance writer Murkett encourage parents to forgo the usual baby puree and move straight to whole foods while continuing to breastfeed primarily after a baby is six months old. Their arguments are scientifically sound, especially when it comes to muscle development in the mouth, and they address the anticipated counterarguments, e.g., the need for iron-fortified cereal at six months. Some parents will be concerned about their lax approach to the order of allowable foods and especially their lack of concern about nuts, but allergic warnings are given where necessary. If mine were little again, I would definitely try this. As long as mom is nursing, who says baby can’t eat lamb chops?""
—Library Journal

“I’ve been telling mothers for years that when babies start grabbing food from the table, they are ready for solids. I had the pleasure of observing this with my own children. What I love about this book is the joy and zest the authors put into parenting, their commonsense approach, and their faith that babies will do the right things for themselves when the time is right. Baby-led weaning is easy, and it makes parenting fun!”
—Nikki Lee RN, MS, IBCLC

“Gill Rapley’s work is amazing and makes so much sense. I recommend this groundbreaking book to every new mother I know. Read it. It will forever change the way you think about feeding your baby.”
—Kathleen Kendall-Tackett, PhD, IBCLC, clinical associate professor of pediatrics, Texas Tech University School of Medicine, and coauthor of Breastfeeding Made Simple

“The benefits are great”
—Independent

“[Baby-led weaning] makes life so much easier.”


“It sounds like common sense: after all, would you want to be strapped into a high chair and force-fed spoon after spoon of bland vegetables? It's surely much more exciting to be able to exercise a bit of control over your diet.”


“I see many happy children, who chose their own food independently and eat at their own pace.”
pediatric dietitian

“Sharing food with Mirah has turned out to be one of the great joys of parenting. Watching her respond to the pleasures of ripe tomatoes, curried rice noodles, and all kinds of meats and vegetables has made mealtime a much more enjoyable experience for all three of us. We can tell she is learning through all of her senses about how various substances respond to being crumbled or dropped or mushed. She seems to really like that she is eating the same foods as we are, and since we are generally sharing the same meal, I am more likely to make us all something healthy.”


“It’s been wonderful, and very funny, watching her discover food, her great concentration in navigating new textures and exploring new tastes… One of our favourite things about BLW is its emphasis on families eating together.”


“You just hand them the food in a suitably-sized piece and if they like it they eat it and if they don't they won't… That's the essence of Baby Led Weaning. No purees, no ice cube trays, no food processor, no potato masher . . . just you and your child, eating food that you enjoy with you and your family . . . My baby is nearly seven months old and . . . ADORED feeding herself while her parents ate their own meals. I can't even begin to tell you how pleasant it is to eat in a restaurant with your Baby Led Weaning child chomping on a piece of bread and butter or a chunk of cucumber from your salad beside you.”


“The thing I really love about baby led weaning is that my son can actively participate in family meals . . . I love that I don’t have to cook 2 different meals, I simply have to adjust our family meal to ensure it’s suitable for him . . . We’re having a blast watching our little men truly learn to enjoy and appreciate food in all of its glory. And it’s SO much easier than purees!”


“As a child psychiatrist, I have worked on a team for children with feeding difficulties… One of the main things I would recommend to these families is giving the child control, and allowing them to have small successes to build on rather than pushing food on them and ending up in a battle . . . I believe strongly in baby led play (again, something I would teach at work) and baby led routines rather than routines being forced on babies to suit parents’ lifestyles (as suggested by at least one popular parenting book). So this intuitively makes sense to me.”

Baked goods that are marvels of ingenuity and simplicity from the famed Bouchon Bakery

The tastes of childhood have always been a touchstone for Thomas Keller, and in this dazzling amalgam of American and French baked goods, you'll find recipes for the beloved TKOs and Oh Ohs (Keller's takes on Oreos and Hostess's Ho Hos) and all the French classics he fell in love with as a young chef apprenticing in Paris: the baguettes, the macarons, the mille-feuilles, the tartes aux fruits.

   Co-author Sebastien Rouxel, executive pastry chef for the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group, has spent years refining techniques through trial and error, and every page offers a new lesson: a trick that assures uniformity, a subtlety that makes for a professional finish, a flash of brilliance that heightens flavor and enhances texture. The deft twists, perfectly written recipes, and dazzling photographs make perfection inevitable.",30302,"Amazon.com Review

From Booklist
With a cavalcade of Michelin-starred restaurants and James Beard awards and the respect and admiration of an entire industry, it may seem there’s little left for culinary powerhouse Keller to conquer. But here, as he has done with the French Laundry and his other establishments, he proves the cookbook can be so much more as he culls together a collection ofrecipes from his famous chain of bakeries in a masterfully produced tome. The glossy, big format lends itself well to foodies of all types, who will relish the many pages of resourceful information and reliable recipes. With each recipe, Keller includes applicable techniques and must-know tidbits, so readers really won’t need to venture beyond these pages for much else. Tackling macaroons or tempering chocolate, for example, may terrify some baking newbies, but Keller’s focused prose lays out the steps clearly and confidently. One puzzling interruption is a series of clip art images sprinkled throughout. For such an otherwise fastidious attention to detail, these seem out of place and second-rate, though readers furiously baking Keller’s succulent treats may hardly notice. --Casey Bayer

Makiko Itoh was born in Tokyo and raised and educated in Japan, England and the U.S. After years of living in New York City, she moved to Switzerland, where it was difficult to find authentic Japanese cooking. This inspired her to go back to her roots and learn how to cook the food her mother and grandmother used to make, using the limited range of Japanese ingredients available to her. In 2003 she started a blog about Japanese cooking called Just Hungry, and in 2007, a companion blog about bento box lunches called Just Bento. Just Hungry is the most popular blog about Japanese cooking in English, and Just Bento boasts more than 220,000 subscribers and millions of page views a month.

The secret to Jim Lahey’s bread is slow-rise fermentation. As Jim shows in My Bread, with step-by-step instructions followed by step-by-step pictures, the amount of labor you put in amounts to 5 minutes: mix water, flour, yeast, and salt, and then let time work its magic―no kneading necessary. The process couldn’t be more simple, or the results more inspiring. Here―finally―Jim Lahey gives us a cookbook that enables us to fit quality bread into our lives at home.
color photos throughout",14725,"From Publishers Weekly
Starred Review. The founder of New York's Sullivan Street Bakery, Lahey started a revolution in 2006 with his no-knead dough technique, in which flour, yeast, salt and water are mixed together quickly, left alone for 12 hours, then baked in a Dutch oven. The baking-averse found themselves suddenly capable of bread-making with a minimum of skill and fuss, opening a world of possibilities. In this wonderful compilation, Lahey elaborates on that method, explaining not only the science behind his approach but, through liberal use of photos, the technique as well. Once readers have mastered his basic dough (which won't take long), they're on their way to crafting homemade pizza, ciabatta, foccacia and rye as well as more playful variations such as peanut butter and jelly bread. While waiting for dough to rise, readers can pick from suggested sandwiches, such as Lahey's Cuban, made with Citrus Roast Porkand homemade pickles. Lahey's passion for bread-making and feeding people carries the book; his plainspoken advice and patient tutelage provide novices with a sure, steady hand to hold; and his methods will surely be adopted by chefs and bakers of all stripes.
Review
“Mr. Lahey's method is creative and smart.... What makes Mr. Lahey's process revolutionary is the resulting combination of great crumb, lightness, incredible flavor―long fermentation gives you that―and an enviable, crackling crust, the feature of bread that most frequently separates amateurs from the pros.... With just a little patience, you will be rewarded with the best no-work bread you have ever made.”
- Mark Bittman, New York Times

“Jim Lahey's My Bread expands on his no-knead, bread-in-a-pot method, a revolutionary development that allows even once-hopeless bakers like me to produce wonderful loaves of thick-crusted goodness. In the professional arena, Jim is the acknowledged master of bread, dough, and crust. Chefs, foodies, and food nerds flock to his bakery and to his pizza joint. He is to bread what the Dalai Lama is to Buddhism.”
- Anthony Bourdain

“The secret to making a foolproof, nearly labor-free loaf that tastes as delicious as anything from a baker..... [Lahey] is the most intuitive bread baker I have ever met.”
- Jeffrey Steingarten, Vogue

“Jim Lahey... opened the Sullivan St Bakery in 1994 selling breads that no one in the city had made before.... Sullivan St became the name to look and ask for, and... became... the place to go for the incredibly airy, oil-brushed, lightly salted pizza Bianca, which is even better than that of the bakery in Rome's Campo de' Fiori.”
- Corby Kummer, The Atlantic

“It's bread above all that [Lahey] knows and loves.... The man can do wonders with flour and water, massaged or not.... He can do fluffy, crunchy, supple, dense. He can do pizza Bianca―man, oh man, can he do pizza Bianca―those salty squares of almost entirely naked crust.”

With every chapter, you get a history lesson, a hunting lesson, a nature lesson and a cooking lesson. . . . Meat Eater offers an overabundance to savor.”—The New York Times Book Review
 
Steven Rinella grew up in Twin Lake, Michigan, the son of a hunter who taught his three sons to love the natural world the way he did. As a child, Rinella devoured stories of the American wilderness, especially the exploits of his hero, Daniel Boone. He began fishing at the age of three and shot his first squirrel at eight and his first deer at thirteen. He chose the colleges he went to by their proximity to good hunting ground, and he experimented with living solely off wild meat. As an adult, he feeds his family from the food he hunts.
 
Meat Eater chronicles Rinella’s lifelong relationship with nature and hunting through the lens of ten hunts, beginning when he was an aspiring mountain man at age ten and ending as a thirty-seven-year-old Brooklyn father who hunts in the remotest corners of North America. He tells of having a struggling career as a fur trapper just as fur prices were falling; of a dalliance with catch-and-release steelhead fishing; of canoeing in the Missouri Breaks in search of mule deer just as the Missouri River was freezing up one November; and of hunting the elusive Dall sheep in the glaciated mountains of Alaska.
 
Through each story, Rinella grapples with themes such as the role of the hunter in shaping America, the vanishing frontier, the ethics of killing, the allure of hunting trophies, the responsibilities that human predators have to their prey, and the disappearance of the hunter himself as Americans lose their connection with the way their food finds its way to their tables. Hunting, he argues, is intimately connected with our humanity; assuming responsibility for acquiring the meat that we eat, rather than entrusting it to proxy executioners, processors, packagers, and distributors, is one of the most respectful and exhilarating things a meat eater can do.
 
A thrilling storyteller with boundless interesting facts and historical information about the land, the natural world, and the history of hunting, Rinella also includes after each chapter a section of “Tasting Notes” that draws from his thirty-plus years of eating and cooking wild game, both at home and over a campfire. In Meat Eater he paints a loving portrait of a way of life that is part of who we are as humans and as Americans.

Praise for Meat Eater
 
“Full of empathy and intelligence . . . In some sections of the book, the author’s prose is so engrossing, so riveting, that it matches, punch for punch, the best sports writing.”—The Wall Street Journal
 
“Steven Rinella is one of the best nature writers of the last decade. . . . This book was a page-turner.”—Tim Ferris
 
“Rinella’s writing is unerringly smart, direct, and sharply detailed.”—The Boston Globe
 
“A unique and valuable alternate view of where our food comes from.”—Anthony Bourdain",4645,"Review
“Truth be told, I have lived a life plenty comfortable with my disdain toward hunters and hunting.  And then along comes Steven Rinella and his revelatory memoir Meat Eater to ruin everything. Unless you count the eternal pursuit of the unmetered parking space, I am not a hunter. I am, however, on a constant quest for good writing. Meat Eater begins with a promise—'This book has a hell of a lot going for it, simply because it’s a hunting story'—and then delivers ceaselessly, like a Domino’s guy with O.C.D. This is survival of the most literate. Graphic, sure, but less so than an episode of ‘CSI,’ and with more believable emoting…this—genuine passion, humbly conveyed—is when nonfiction slaughters fiction and hangs it over its mantel. The text is relentlessly vivid and clear…the commitment, effort and ardor are unflinching. What Rinella does to prepare a muskrat trap when he’s in fifth grade takes five more steps and is infinitely more loving than whatever I did as a fifth grader to break in my baseball glove. With every chapter, you get a history lesson, a hunting lesson, a nature lesson and a cooking lesson, and most of the chapters end with 'tasting notes' on various game. … Readers will never ask themselves, 'What is he talking about?' The only question they might have is, 'Why isn’t this guy the head of the N.R.A.?'…  [A]gain and again, his descriptive powers trump gruesomeness…. Meat Eater offers an overabundance to savor.” —New York Times Book Review

“As Steven Rinella is quick to point out, the hunting story is the oldest sort of story there is. Humans developed language, it is commonly held, to tell them. When told properly, as they are in Meat Eater, such stories are not simple gloats by the successful hunter around the table, proudly chewing on the biggest portion of meat and relishing the respect he has earned from his tribe by bringing back the protein. Rather, they are stories of man's relationships with his fellow hunters, his family, the land and the animals. The stories in Meat Eater are full of empathy and intelligence….In some sections of the book, the author's prose is so engrossing, so riveting, that it matches, punch for punch, the best sports writing. When Mr. Rinella wades into the surging Grand River, to throw a fly for steelheads, the story moves as well as Tom Callahan writing about Johnny Unitas in the 1958 championship or Bill Nack writing about Secretariat.” —Wall Street Journal

“Relentlessly descriptive and endlessly evocative ‘tasting guides’ at the close of each chapter help armchair hunters get a sense of what it might be like digging into their own heaping plate of camp meat, deer hearts or sun-dried jerky…the writing is The author wisely allows philosophical questions pertaining to the validity of hunting and the efficacy of state-enforced regulations to simmer in the background, and he effectively shows nature in all its glory….”
 
“On one level, [Rinella has] penned an entertaining collection of the sort of anecdotes that, if you had the good luck to meet him at a Brooklyn hipster’s cocktail party, would be conversational gold. Though animals figure almost as prominently in his narrative as people, Rinella is …But in , He writes from the standpoint of a married writer and father living in one of the world’s more densely populated metropolises. His book .”
 
“For the typical urbanite, feeling disdain for gun owners is about as easy as broiling a boneless, shrink-wrapped chicken breast: They’re hicks. Red State rubes. Mowing down Bambi with their assault rifles. Meanwhile, we meander the supermarket aisles, poking around for grass-fed this or free-range that, floating in a cloud of ethical contradiction and denial. Without breaking it down this polemically, Steven Rinella, in his memoir, , rigorously describes his trajectory from unexamined to intensely reconstructed killer of wildlife, a progression that should assist the typical city slicker in replacing categorical dismissal with something more akin to nuanced understanding… And critically, we witness Rinella’s evolving sense of what all this killing might mean. Acutely conveyed are the ways society is elbowing aside an age-old practice, often bloody and brutal, and replacing it with practices numbingly antiseptic and increasingly unreal. By the end, regardless of how you feel about guns or hunting, its appeal has ironically been made alive. It’s the perfect negative image of our pervasive technological moment — bracing, dangerous, and direct rather than mediated, packaged, and disassociated…..”
 
“Chances are, Steven Rinella's life is very different than yours or mine. He does not source his food at the local supermarket. Meat Eater is It's a look both backward, at the way things used to be—and forward—to a time when every diner truly understands what's on the end of the fork.”
 
“If hunting has fewer participants and advocates than ever before, Rinella is doing his best to reverse the trend.   Perhaps what’s most remarkable about his work is that it offers readers who only ‘hunt’ at the local grocery store the opportunity to enjoy a vicarious adventure or two in the world of outdoor protein gathering….” 
 
“ Also, almost every chapter is finished with short ‘Tasting Notes’ that outline the culinary dos and don’ts for meat from game like squirrel, black bear, and mountain lion.  and even if you don’t agree with his ideas on hunting lions with dogs or catch-and-release fishing .”

Kristie Sullivan was obese from the age of three. She'd tried everything to lose weight, even gastric bypass.  By the age of 45 she was desperate. When she discovered a ketogenic diet, her body finally started responding positively to her eating habits. Her lifetime of struggle was resolved by eliminating carbohydrates!

Kristie Sullivan's passion is reaching out to others who struggle and helping them to learn why a ketogenic diet works, and how to make this a sustainable lifestyle.  Too many physicians recognize that carbohydrate restriction can work, yet they don’t prescribe it because they fear it isn’t sustainable.  Patient compliance is perceived as a primary barrier to success, and Kristie struggles to bridge that gap by showing that it's not only practical but sustainable for the rest of your life.

When you know a culinary ratio, it’s not like knowing a single recipe, it’s instantly knowing a thousand.

Why spend time sorting through the millions of cookie recipes available in books, magazines, and on the Internet? Isn’t it easier just to remember 1-2-3? That’s the ratio of ingredients that always make a basic, delicious cookie dough: 1 part sugar, 2 parts fat, and 3 parts flour. From there, add anything you want—chocolate, lemon and orange zest, nuts, poppy seeds, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, almond extract, or peanut butter, to name a few favorite additions. Replace white sugar with brown for a darker, chewier cookie. Add baking powder and/or eggs for a lighter, airier texture.

Ratios are the starting point from which a thousand variations begin.

Ratios are the simple proportions of one ingredient to another. Biscuit dough is 3:1:2—or 3 parts flour, 1 part fat, and 2 parts liquid. This ratio is the beginning of many variations, and because the biscuit takes sweet and savory flavors with equal grace, you can top it with whipped cream and strawberries or sausage gravy. Vinaigrette is 3:1, or 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar, and is one of the most useful sauces imaginable, giving everything from grilled meats and fish to steamed vegetables or lettuces intense flavor.

Cooking with ratios will unchain you from recipes and set you free. With thirty-three ratios and suggestions for enticing variations, Ratio is the truth of cooking: basic preparations that teach us how the fundamental ingredients of the kitchen—water, flour, butter and oils, milk and cream, and eggs—work. Change the ratio and bread dough becomes pasta dough, cakes become muffins become popovers become crepes.

As the culinary world fills up with overly complicated recipes and never-ending ingredient lists, Michael Ruhlman blasts through the surplus of information and delivers this innovative, straightforward book that cuts to the core of cooking. Ratio provides one of the greatest kitchen lessons there is—and it makes the cooking easier and more satisfying than ever.",23078,"Review
""Cooking, like so many creative endeavors, is defined by relationships. For instance, knowing exactly how much flour to put into a loaf of bread isn't nearly as useful as understanding the relationship between the flour and the water, or fat, or salt . That relationship is defined by a 'ratio, ' and having a ratio in hand is like having a secret decoder ring that frees you from the tyranny of recipes. Professional cooks and bakers guard ratios passionately so it wouldn't surprise me a bit if Michael Ruhlman is forced into hiding like a modern-day Prometheus, who in handing us mortals a power better suited to the gods, has changed the balance of kitchen power forever. I for one am grateful. I suspect you will be too."" -- Alton Brown, author of ""I'm Just Here for the Food""

Like the idea of preparing fork-tender beef stew in thirty minutes and pot roast in under an hour? All this and more is made possible by the pressure cooker, a magical appliance that produces soul-satisfying, homemade food in one-third (or less) the standard cooking time.
In Pressure Perfect, Lorna Sass, the country's leading authority on pressure cooking, distills her two decades of experience into one comprehensive volume. First learn everything you need to know about buying and using today's 100% safe cookers. Then enjoy more than 200 recipes for preparing soups, meats, poultry, grains, beans, vegetables, and desserts in record time. How about whipping up a savory risotto in 4 minutes, chicken cacciatore in 12 minutes, or a delectable chocolate cheesecake in 25 minutes?
Because the pressure cooker tenderizes tough cuts of meat quickly, you can prepare fall-off-the-bone beef short ribs or lamb shanks on weekday nights instead of waiting for a special occasion. The pressure cooker also allows you to make delectable one-pot meals in minutes. Among the many innovative recipes and techniques, you'll learn to cook meatloaf and potatoes simultaneously in 10 minutes, and meatballs, pasta, and sauce at the same time in only 5 minutes. Many recipes also suggest Cook-Along ideas for preparing vegetables and grains along with the entre.
To further help those cooking under pressure (and who isn't nowadays?), each chapter contains timing charts for quick reference. Tips and Pressure Points in every recipe ensure optimum results.
This ultimate guide to pressure cooking is a must for all busy cooks, boaters, brides, college students, and anyone looking for a great way to make irresistible, healthy, home-made food fast.",185097,"From Booklist
Predating the Crock-Pot was its opposite in cooking speed, the pressure cooker. Contemporary pressure cookers take much of the guesswork and anxiety out of their operation and make them a boon for the cook who needs to get something on the table fast and with minimum fuss. Pressure Perfect not only gives dozens of recipes for the pressure cooker, but Sass also shows how to modify each recipe to create an ever-varying series of dishes. Her beef in beer and mustard gravy not only gives the cook a choice among brisket, chuck, oxtails, or short ribs but also offers alteration in sauce structure to create either horseradish cream or chili versions. Tables throughout the book explain how to adjust standard recipes to take advantage of a pressure cooker. Mark Knoblauch

One of the most important assets you have in your quest for beauty is energy. Energy is a key factor in your ability to shed weight easily and permanently, achieve great health and look your most beautiful. Energy regenerates your liver and other tissue cells, flushes toxic waste from the body, helps maintain your ideal weight, keeps your skin's collagen smooth and your hair healthy, and keeps blood from stagnating into dark under-eye circles. The more energy you have, the better you feel and the more beautiful you become.

What eats up energy? The quick answer: digestion. Yes, digestion! Did you know that the full process of digestion takes more energy than any other internal function of the human body? Some experts estimate that digestion takes as much as half or more of your total energy.Digestion is the key that can elevate your beauty to the highest levels, or, adversely, take you down, by sucking up precious energy that could be used for other processes. Beauty Detox Foods are designed to free up energy from digestion, which is the single most important way to redirect large amounts of energy to make weight loss easy and help you look your most beautiful.

Your body's systems are always trying to maintain perfect balance, which leads to superior health and beauty, but this is possible only after you have cleansed yourself of toxic material that constantly accumulates. The more efficiently you digest food (in other words, the less energy your body has to spend on digesting), the more energy your body has to clean out the old toxic material and perform all those beautifying processes. The toxic sludge amasses at a much faster pace when you're not digesting your food efficiently.

Detoxing yourself by getting rid of old waste is the key to allowing your digestion to function optimally. When you loosen the toxic sludge from your system, your energy will automatically increase because your body will be able to perform digestive and other functions efficiently and with much less effort. Thanks to that renewed energy, you will also lose weight and look years (or even decades) younger. Your skin will radiate and your hair will grow in with vibrant body and a healthy sheen.

Most diets focus on the number of calories or grams of carbs and protein to consume, yet they make no effort to deduce how efficiently—or not—your system can break down or use any given food. These eating plans don't consider Beauty Energy and how it's used up in digesting foods that are difficult to break down. Calories and grams of carbs and proteins alone don't give a holistic picture of how healthy a food is within the human body, how nutrient-dense it is or how much fiber it contains. Nor do they give you any clues as to the amount of foreign chemicals, preservatives and additives that may be in that given food. That is the very reason that dieting and losing weight have always seemed like such a miserable chore and struggle, a struggle that most of us feel we are losing, along with energy levels. And it's one of the reasons people age at such an accelerated rate. There's more to our achieving thriving health and beauty than adding up a bunch of numbers. Don't worry, because you are soon going to learn the easy way to lose weight and get your energy back again.

The high content of mineral-, enzyme- and fiber-rich Beauty Detox Foods will help cleanse and unclog the waste from the intestines so that your body can start to absorb nutrients optimally. But building up toxic waste in the body can take many years, even decades, so detoxification on a deeper level is not something that happens instantly. It should be a gradual, controlled and regulated process…and it needs to take place continuously to get the tangible results you are after. In fact, detoxification that happens too quickly can be very uncomfortable—you can feel or actually become ill. But you can start to see changes fairly quickly by making important shifts in the foods you eat.



The best thing you can do to improve your overall health and beauty is to fill your diet with whole, unrefined plant foods. As pointed out in ""Natural, plant-based foods provide all the essential nutrients needed for a well-balanced and healthy diet, as there are no nutrients found in animal-based foods that are not abundantly available in plant foods, with the exception of vitamin B. And you can supplement vitamin B for insurance."" In the past, B was obtained in adequate amounts from a plant-based diet, because microorganisms in the soil manufacture B. But today, foods are sanitized and scrubbed of soil exposure. Although you may choose to keep some meat in your diet for taste, social, familial or any other reasons, there is no nutritional reason to do so. We discuss protein (that inevitable topic when the notion of a plant-based diet is discussed) in the following section, but rest assured that if your diet isn't deficient in calories, it is practically impossible for you to be deficient in protein.

To keep your body running efficiently, greens are one of the most important food groups. Green vegetables are among the most nutrient-dense of all foods and are full of alkaline minerals, including calcium, chlorophyll and amino acids. They make up your key Beauty Foods that regenerate and purify your cells.

Besides greens, you want to eat substantial portions of a wide range of vegetables, which will supply you with key minerals, enzymes and vitamins. Their fiber will help sweep waste from the body, as well as fill you up.





It's preferable to eat only fresh vegetables. However, frozen vegetables are the next best choice if you don't have access to fresh produce or the time to purchase it. Canned vegetables should be avoided altogether, as they may contain preservatives or chemicals such as bisphenol A, are high in sodium and tend to have lower nutritional value than fresh or frozen vegetables.



Eating vegetables raw is the key to obtaining the most beautifying vitamins, enzymes and nutrition, so eat plenty of salads and raw veggies every day. Any type of heat will destroy some of their nutrients. But I know it's not reasonable to eat only salads all the time. It's okay to have some cooked vegetables, especially when you're transitioning and when eating dinner. When cooking vegetables, avoid charring or overboiling them, because you want to preserve the nutrients as much as you can. Steaming or lightly cooking in a bit of vegetable broth, for example, will retain some of the vegetables' nutrients and ensure they are digested easily.



Over the past decade or so, a number of high-protein, low-carb diets have become increasingly popular. A study published in 2002 and funded by the Atkins Center for Complementary Medicine researched fifty-one obese people who were put on the low-carb Atkins Diet. Over six months, forty-one subjects maintained the diet and lost an average of twenty pounds. Sounds good, doesn't it? But consider that the participants in the study were consuming an average of only 1,450 calories per day, which is 35 percent less than the average American consumption of 2,250 calories a day. On any kind of diet, if you were to restrict your calories by at least 35 percent, you would lose weight, at least for the short term. In the same study the researchers also stated that ""at some point during the twenty-four weeks, 68% reported constipation, 63% reported bad breath, 51% reported headaches, 10% reported hair loss, and one woman reported increased menstrual bleeding.""

Another frightening figure from the study is that dieters had a fifty-three percent increase in the amount of calcium excreted in their urine, which is a big problem for bone density and health. A diet that creates such high levels of constipation shows how unnatural it is for the human body. Constipation holds toxins in the body and is incredibly aging.

Digesting animal protein creates all sorts of by-products in the body, like purines, uric acid and ammonia by-products. These toxins are absorbed into your bloodstream through the colon and circulate all around your body. When your blood is clogged with toxins, it can't transport as many beautifying minerals, and these toxins can age and clog the skin cells of your face. Furthermore, excessive protein consumption overworks the liver and kidneys. In his book Gabriel Cousens, M.D., discusses how ammonia, a by-product of digesting protein, contributes to aging. As he notes, ""Ammonia, which is a breakdown product of a high-flesh-food diet, is directly toxic to the system. It has been found to create free radical damage and cross-linking (a process associated with skin wrinkles and aging), as well as depletes the body's energy.""

Ketosis, which may occur as a result of a low-carb diet, whereby by-products called ketones accumulate in your body, makes the blood acidic. An acidic body tends to age faster. Take a look for yourself at people who are on high-protein, low-carb diets. They usually look ""hardened"" and far older than they are, with what I call the ""old skinny"" look, which has lost all its youthfulness. I'll bet you can think of some ""old skinny"" people!

One study published in the focusing on the short- and long-term effects of high-protein and low-carb diets found that ""complications such as heart arrhythmias, cardiac contractile function impairment, sudden death, osteoporosis, kidney damage, increased cancer risk, impairment of physical activity and lipid abnormalities can all be linked to long-term restriction of carbohydrates in the diet."" Animal protein is also the most complex of all foods: it takes about twice as long as other foods to pass through your digestive system. The more slowly a food is digested in your body, which is a hot 98.6 degrees, the greater the chance that toxins can be created.

There definitely have to be limits to the amount of concentrated protein you consume. The ""eat as much animal protein as you can"" theory is both aging to your skin and body, and dangerous. Taking in more protein than is needed places a heavy burden on your body, creating acidity (see Chapter 2 for more info on acidity) and wasting Beauty Energy—the very thing you are trying to avoid.



Fish and seafood are generally good nutritional choices. But that's not to say that you should start loading up on seafood. Fish is cited as one of the most polluted foods you can eat. Three of the biggest water contaminants that are found in fish are hydrocarbons, PCBs and mercury, although there are others like DDT and fertilizers in our waters.

The sad fact is that our water sources, including the oceans, lakes and rivers, have been polluted with megadoses of toxic chemicals, and fish today act as a sponge for toxins and are often heavily contaminated. Toxins diminish your beauty and age you faster, so although some will argue that fish has some positive health benefits, such as good omega-3 oils (which we'll discuss later; there are cleaner options for getting these fats), the benefits have to be balanced against the dangers.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend strict limits on fish consumption for pregnant women because of risks posed to the developing fetus. However, especially if you eat out at restaurants for dinner and can choose from some better options (see below), you may choose to keep fish in your diet as part of your moderate amount of weekly animal protein intake.

Here are some tips for choosing fish if you would like to eat it:

Don't eat fish or seafood more than a maximum of two times a week.

Choose fish that may be lower in heavy metals and toxins: wild Alaskan salmon, mahi-mahi, sole, tilapia, trout, striped sea bass, haddock, halibut and whitefish.

Avoid fish high in toxins: swordfish, tuna, shark, bluefish, Chilean sea bass, tilefish, marlin, shellfish (which is particularly high in the heavy metal cadmium) such as shrimp and blue crab, Atlantic or farmed salmon, bluefish, wild striped bass, mackerel and grouper.

Avoid store-bought canned tuna fish, which is high in mercury. A woman who eats just one can of tuna a week will be 30 percent over the EPA cutoff for safe mercury levels.

Because a lot of the chemicals are stored in the fish's fat, be sure to broil or bake your fish to allow as much fat as possible to drain from it. When eating out, order baked fish as opposed to pan-seared or fried dishes.

Be cautious when eating sushi and sashimi. If the fish weren't toxic, it would be a great choice since it's raw, and the amino acids that make up the fish proteins don't become denatured from cooking. But tuna, salmon and other fish commonly used for sushi and sashimi are often the most toxic fish of all.

WEBER GRILL: The year was 1952. Weber Brothers Metal Works employee George Stephen Sr. had a crazy idea. Using as a model the marine buoys made by his company, he concocted a funky dome-shaped grill with a lid to protect food and keep in rich barbecue flavor. From those humble beginnings, an international grilling revolution was born. Today, Weber has grown to become the leading brand of charcoal and gas grills and accessories, and George’s kettle has become a backyard icon.","['way to grill', 'easy to follow', 'step by step', 'weber way', 'jamie purviance', 'gas grill', 'highly recommend', 'great book', 'weber grill', 'smokey mountain', 'red meat', 'every recipe', 'poultry seafood', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Chey MD (Foreword)",4.3,457,0,15.15,,"A diet plan proven to relieve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and other digestive disorders—presented by the world’s leading experts and tailored to you

“A must-have survival guide”—Gerard E. Mullin, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of Integrative GI Nutrition Services at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine

“What can I do to feel better?” For years, millions of adults who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have asked this question, often to be met with scientifically unfounded or inadequate advice.

The low-FODMAP diet is the long-awaited answer. In clinical trials, over three quarters of people with chronic digestive symptoms gain significant relief by reducing their intake of FODMAPs—difficult-to-digest carbs found in foods such as wheat, milk, beans, soy, and certain fruits, vegetables, nuts, and sweeteners.

In The Complete Low-FODMAP Diet, Sue Shepherd and Peter Gibson explain what causes digestive distress, how the low-FODMAP diet helps, and how to:

• Identify and avoid foods high in FODMAPs
• Develop a personalized and sustainable low-FODMAP diet
• Shop, menu plan, entertain, travel, and eat out with peace of mind
• Follow the program if you have IBS, celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or diabetes, and if you eat a vegetarian, vegan, low-fat, or dairy-free diet.

And, with 80 delicious low-FODMAP, gluten-free recipes, you can manage your symptoms, feel great, and eat well—for life.",11422,"Review
“This detailed, yet easy-to-understand book is written by the two gurus of FODMAP, a scientifically proven dietary treatment that’s rapidly gaining recognition around the world. This book is the roadmap for eliminating problem foods and reintroducing items to find the customized food plan that works specifically for you. More than 80 gut-friendly, gluten-free recipes are included.”—Living Without

“[Shepherd and Gibson's] book does a nice job of explaining how and why a low FODMAP diet would be beneficial to many IBS patients. Their in-depth experience with the subject permeates throughout the book, as they offer many practical suggestions for following the diet, including food lists, meal plans, recipes and tips for navigating real-life situations. What makes this book a stand-out is the stunning photography and a sense that following a low FODMAP diet can actually be luxurious! . . . If you are interested in following a low FODMAP diet for your IBS, this book should absolutely be on your bookshelf. If you like to cook, you will want to keep it in your kitchen! . . . Choosing low FODMAPs foods offers such a wonderful alternative to a bland diet, and more importantly, allows you to take in the kinds of foods that are helpful for improving digestive health. This book will definitely guide you in fitting the diet into your lifestyle in a way that feels easy and natural.”—Barbara Bolen, PhD, IBS.about.com

“IBS has been a daunting problem for patients and their physicians for years. We have seen many drugs and different dietary fads come and go. So, it is wonderful that this solution has been developed for many patients with IBS: a diet based on sound scientific and physiological mechanisms. Combined with good medical care that includes testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and fructose and lactose intolerance, the low-FODMAP diet can be individualized, liberalized, and tailored to each patient. This book also provides a great deal of information as to how the diet can be truly indulged in!”—Peter H. R. Green, MD, Professor of Clinical Medicine and Director of the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University

“The low-FODMAP diet has revolutionized my practice and has helped so many of my patients. If you suffer from irritable bowel syndrome and choosing food is a challenge, this splendid book is a must-have survival guide. Begin your journey back to good gut health by using food as medicine. Kudos to Drs. Shepherd and Gibson!”— Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of Integrative GI Nutrition Services at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and coauthor of The Inside Tract: Your Good Gut Guide to Great Digestive Health, http://thefoodmd.com

“For those with celiac disease who continue to have digestive issues, is a must-read. Drs. Shepherd and Gibson do a tremendous job both in identifying the foods responsible for digestive distress and in offering a personalized approach to a balanced diet free from those triggers. With science-based information and easy-to-follow recipes, this book delivers the why and how that people are looking to know.”— President of the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness (NFCA)

“Drs. Shepherd and Gibson have truly created a complete reference guide about the low-FODMAP diet. The book offers evidence that supports the use of the low-FODMAP diet to manage digestive symptoms, especially IBS. The authors walk you through precise diets, recipes, and menus to put the diet into practice. The recipes are easy to follow and the illustrations are quite breathtaking. I strongly recommend this book for all IBS sufferers.”— Founder of IBS Self Help and Support Group

Growing up in Mississippi and St. Louis, Robbie Montgomery, the oldest of nine children, was often responsible for putting meals on the family table. Working side by side with her mother in their St. Louis kitchen, Robbie learned to prepare dozens of classic soul food dishes.
Now, at seventy-two, Miss Robbie passes down those traditions for generations of fans to enjoy in Sweetie Pie's Cookbook. Robbie takes you into the kitchen to prepare her most favored meals—smothered pork chops, salmon croquettes, baked chicken—and tells you heartfelt and humorous stories, including amazing tales from her life at the restaurant and on the road as a back-up singer. Miss Robbie began her culinary career on the road—in the segregated America of the1960s, finding welcoming restaurants in small cities and towns was often challenging for African-Americans. When a collapsed lung prematurely ended her singing career, Miss Robbie returned to St. Louis, using her formidable cooking talent to open a soul food restaurant that would make her legend.

Charcuterie exploded onto the scene in 2005 and encouraged an army of home cooks and professional chefs to start curing their own foods. This love song to animal fat and salt has blossomed into a bona fide culinary movement, throughout America and beyond, of curing meats and making sausage, pâtés, and confits. Charcuterie: Revised and Updated will remain the ultimate and authoritative guide to that movement, spreading the revival of this ancient culinary craft.
Early in his career, food writer Michael Ruhlman had his first taste of duck confit. The experience “became a fascination that transformed into a quest” to understand the larger world of food preservation, called charcuterie, once a critical factor in human survival. He wondered why its methods and preparations, which used to keep communities alive and allowed for long-distance exploration, had been almost forgotten. Along the way he met Brian Polcyn, who had been surrounded with traditional and modern charcuterie since childhood. “My Polish grandma made kielbasa every Christmas and Easter,” he told Ruhlman. At the time, Polcyn was teaching butchery at Schoolcraft College outside Detroit.
Ruhlman and Polcyn teamed up to share their passion for cured meats with a wider audience. The rest is culinary history. Charcuterie: Revised and Updated is organized into chapters on key practices: salt-cured meats like pancetta, dry-cured meats like salami and chorizo, forcemeats including pâtés and terrines, and smoked meats and fish. Readers will find all the classic recipes: duck confit, sausages, prosciutto, bacon, pâté de campagne, and knackwurst, among others. Ruhlman and Polcyn also expand on traditional mainstays, offering recipes for hot- and cold-smoked salmon; shrimp, lobster, and leek sausage; and grilled vegetable terrine. All these techniques make for a stunning addition to a contemporary menu.
Thoroughly instructive and fully illustrated, this updated edition includes seventy-five detailed line drawings that guide the reader through all the techniques. With new recipes and revised sections to reflect the best equipment available today, Charcuterie: Revised and Updated remains the undisputed authority on charcuterie.

For lunch, she has classics with a twist, such as Tomato, Mozzarella, and Pesto Paninis and Old-Fashioned Potato Salad, which are simply delicious. Then there are Ina’s homey dinners–from her own version of loin of pork stuffed with sautéed fennel to the exotic flavors of Eli’s Asian Salmon. And since Ina knows no one ever forgets what you serve for dessert, she includes recipes for outrageously luscious sweets like Peach and Blueberry Crumble, Pumpkin Mousse Parfait, and Chocolate Cupcakes with Peanut Butter Icing.

Ina also lets readers in on her time-tested secrets for cooking and entertaining. Get the inside scoop on everything from what Ina considers when she’s designing a kitchen to menu-planning basics and how to make a dinner party fun (here’s a hint: it doesn’ t involve making complicated food!).

Along with beautiful photographs of Ina’s dishes, her home, and the East Hampton she loves, this book is filled with signature recipes that strike the perfect balance between elegance and casual comfort. With her most indispensable collection yet, Ina Garten proves beyond a shadow of doubt that there truly is no place like home.",7091,"From Publishers Weekly
Garten's fifth cookbook (after Barefoot in Paris) follows her surefire formula: uncomplicated but elegant recipes for the home cook whose priority is spending time with friends and family, not in the kitchen. From breakfast to dessert, the Food Network star organizes this volume by meal, with an easy-to-navigate recipe list at the top of each section. Many entries provide a creative alternative to the basics: the Summer Borscht—which calls for fresh beets, cucumber and chicken stock—will make a cool, flavorful substitute for the predictable bowl of gazpacho, and the mayonnaise-based Jon Snow's Fish Salad—freshly roasted white fish filets (e.g., halibut) distinguished by the addition of diced fennel—will supersede tuna salad. But some of Garten's ""feel-good"" foods barely warrant inclusion—her recipe for Sunday Morning Oatmeal barely elevates the instructions on the Quaker canister. If not always inventive, these recipes (e.g., Cornish Hens with Cornbread Stuffing) should be reliable for seasoned but time-pressed or ambitious but inexperienced cooks. Striking a warm, personal tone, Garten also includes advice on designing a kitchen, making a grocery list, planning a menu and where to shop and dine in the Hamptons. (Nov.)

Martha Stewart's Prime Rib Roast
Prime rib, or standing rib roast, has long been a mainstay at the holiday table (where it is often paired with Yorkshire pudding, a British specialty made from the pan juices and a simple batter of flour, eggs, and milk). As it is expensive, prime rib should be handled with extra care. It is imperative that you have an instant-read thermometer for determining the internal temperature; if allowed to cook too long, the meat will no longer be a rosy pink inside, the optimal color for any high-quality roast. Remove the roast when still rare, as it will continue to cook as it rests, rising as much as 10 degrees in 20 minutes.
15 dried bay leaves, crumbled
1/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh sage leaves, plus several whole leaves for garnish
1/2 cup extra--virgin olive oil
coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
1/3 cup finely grated orange zest (from 2 to 3 oranges)


1 three-rib prime rib of beef (about 7 pounds), trimmed and frenched

From Publishers Weekly
Starred Review. Stewart's trademark ability to simplify everything that seems complex or overwhelming in domestic life serves her well in this excellent foundation course in cooking techniques. Like Stewart herself, its pages exude authority along with accessibility, with numerous helpful checklists, charts and boxed tips artfully arranged throughout the numbered lessons that build from essentials such as roasting chicken perfectly or wilting leafy greens just so to more involved, less frequently used methods featured as extra credit, such as grinding and binding meat into paté or producing a peerless vegetable puree. Each technique is illustrated by numerous stylish yet instructive photos, and accompanied by a few carefully selected recipes and variations that successfully aim to familiarize cooks with a basic procedure without inundating them with the full range of possibilities right away. They will also appreciate Stewart's concise but enlightening introductions to each chapter and the lessons within, For new cooks looking to establish a core set of kitchen skills as well as for those just looking to brush up or to have a ready reference to cooking fundamentals, this impressive volume will be an ideal choice.

One morning Jenny McCarthy was having a cup of coffee when she sensed something was wrong. She ran into her two-year-old son Evan's room and found him having a seizure. Doctor after doctor misdiagnosed Evan until, after many harrowing, life-threatening episodes, one good doctor discovered that Evan is autistic.

With a foreword from Dr. David Feinberg, medical director of the Resnick Neuro-psychiatric Hospital at UCLA, and an introduction by Jerry J.

From America's most chic restaurants to the countless kitchens of avid home cooks, everyone is rediscovering the joy of cooking with classic cast iron. Cast iron cooking has always been a kitchen favorite with its even heating, great heat retention and its flexibility to go outdoors and grill or cook over an open fire. According to Esquire magazine, cast iron cookware ""will enrich your eggs and burgers, it's impossible to break and it will last longer than you.""

And now with The Lodge Cast Iron Cookbook, every cook will learn the simple, savory secrets of cast iron cookery. From the kitchens of Lodge, America's leading manufacturer of cast iron cookware, this unique cookbook offers over 200 mouthwatering recipes. The delectable dishes range from breakfast specials to the secrets of great fried food, to soups and stews, biscuits and baked goods, fish, veggies and finally those sweet finales. And the book features favorite cast iron cooking recipes by well-known cooks such as Bill and Cheryl Jamison, Nick Malgieri and Allison Fishman. Special cooking lessons include cast iron cooking basics and how to enjoy open air cooking and grilling.

This special culinary delight features great cooking stories and intriguing vignettes on the history and legend and lore of cast iron cooking. Each unique recipe, culled from cooks across the country, is illustrated with four-color photography. Published in a special flexible binding, this cookbook will be a keepsake treasured by all cooks.",79633,"From Booklist
Contemporary focus on good, healthy cooking has led to a renaissance of interest in cast-iron pots and pans, the sort that Grandma used so effectively. Today’s top chefs swear by cast iron for searing meats and fish, and a well-seasoned, properly maintained cast-iron pan can be nearly as nonstick as any fancy Teflon skillet. Tennessee’s Lodge factory has become practically synonymous with cast-iron cookware, so it’s consistent that Lodge should generate a cookbook to show off their products’ best culinary characteristics. This collection of recipes offers dishes for every family meal, from breakfast through dessert, and includes both stove-top and outdoor cooking. Recipes cover what most will recognize as conventional, unpretentious American home-style food. Since nothing but cast iron produces that inimitable crisp-crunchy brown crust typical of the finest southern cornbread, that topic alone merits its very own chapter. --Mark Knoblauch

Come on in, but be prepared—it might not be quite what you expect. There is flour on the counter, oats that overflowed onto the floor, chocolate-encrusted spoons in the sink. There is Joey, the husband, exhausted by the thirty-five preschoolers who were hanging on him all day, and he is stuffing granola into his mouth to ease his five o’clock starvation. There are two little girls trying to show me cartwheels in that miniscule space between the refrigerator and the counter where I really need to be.”
 
In her debut cookbook, Alana Chernila inspires you to step inside your kitchen, take a look around, and change the way you relate to food. The Homemade Pantry was born of a tight budget, Alana’s love for sharing recipes with her farmers’ market customers, and a desire to enjoy a happy cooking and eating life with her young family. On a mission to kick their packaged-food habit, she learned that with a little determination, anything she could buy at the store could be made in her kitchen, and her homemade versions were more satisfying, easier to make than she expected, and tastier. 
           
Here are her very approachable recipes for 101 everyday staples, organized by supermarket aisle—from crackers to cheese, pesto to sauerkraut, and mayonnaise to toaster pastries. The Homemade Pantry is a celebration of food made by hand—warm mozzarella that is stretched, thick lasagna noodles rolled from flour and egg, fresh tomato sauce that bubbles on the stove. Whether you are trying a recipe for butter, potato chips, spice mixes, or ketchup, you will discover the magic and thrill that comes with the homemade pantry.
           
Alana captures the humor and messiness of everyday family life, too. A true friend to the home cook, she shares her “tense moments” to help you get through your own. With stories offering patient, humble advice, tips for storing the homemade foods, and rich four-color photography throughout, The Homemade Pantry will quickly become the go-to source for how to make delicious staples in your home kitchen.",71382,"Amazon.com Review

1/4 cup roughly chopped unpeeled fresh ginger
Three 4-inch cinnamon sticks
3 whole cloves
4 cardamom pods
3 black peppercorns

Review
“Alana is the real deal: A practically minded, thoroughly modern yet authentically old school homesteader. Ingeniously opting for quality over quantity, she strives for excellence, taste, and nutrition, and inspires her readers to do the same. She shows us the functional beauty in a frugal kind of cooking that’s nevertheless alive with luxury and abundance. Believe her and practice what she preaches.”
—LUCINDA SCALA QUINN, host of Mad Hungry with Lucinda Scala Quinn and author of Mad Hungry

“Alana Chernila’s food is the sort of honest, natural, and down-to-earth cooking that I crave. On the top of my can’t-wait-to-make list are the toaster pastries, which I’m sure my own daughter will adore, and the cucumber pickles, which are right up my DIY-alley. Plus, Alana’s stories are engaging and fun to read. But what I really love about this book is Alana’s passionate approach to homemade kitchen staples, which I hope will get people to rethink the questionable goods that we all keep in our pantries. We can do better, and she shows us how. I would feel confident cooking any of her recipes for my friends and family, and that means a lot.”
—MELISSA CLARK, New York Times food columnist and author of Cook This Now
 
“You can work culinary magic on a whim when you keep a well-stocked, mindfully edited pantry. Alana’s beautiful book shows you the way with an impressive range of homemade go-tos. She covers all the useful day-to-day staples here with understated style. Pancake and waffle mixes, granola, tomato sauce, and salad dressings bump up against recipes for crackers, soda syrups, sauerkraut, and spice blends. It’s the sort of book that makes you want to head straight for your kitchen.”
—HEIDI SWANSON, bestselling author of Super Natural Every Day
 
“Alana Chernila has given us something incredibly special: a book both practical and inspiring, authoritative, and down to earth. Reading THE HOMEMADE PANTRY, I feel as though I’m in the kitchen with her and her family, and that together, there’s nothing that we can’t do. Why not make my own hot sauce, mozzarella, or graham crackers? From now on, I know I will.”

“Alana Chernila not only understands the power of food, she understands the power of food and family. She understands the comfort and security a bowl of creamy soup brings on a winter day; she understands that a lasagna from scratch can bond a family in ways that the boxed kind can’t; and perhaps most importantly, she understands that a warm homemade toaster pastry will go a long way in easing any brand of maternal guilt. I think that recipe in particular is going to be a keeper in my house.”

My name is Alton Brown, and I wrote this book. It’s my first in a few years because I’ve been a little busy with TV stuff and interwebs stuff and live stage show stuff. Sure, I’ve been cooking, but it’s been mostly to feed myself and people in my immediate vicinity—which is really what a cook is supposed to do, right? Well, one day I was sitting around trying to organize my recipes, and I realized that I should put them into a personal collection. One thing led to another, and here’s EveryDayCook. There’s still plenty of science and hopefully some humor in here (my agent says that’s my “wheelhouse”), but unlike in my other books, a lot of attention went into the photos, which were all taken on my iPhone (take that, Instagram) and are suitable for framing. As for the recipes, which are arranged by time of day, they’re pretty darned tasty. Highlights include: 
 
• Morning: Buttermilk Lassi, Overnight Coconut Oats, Nitrous Pancakes 
• Coffee Break: Cold Brew Coffee, Lacquered Bacon, Seedy Date Bars
• Noon: Smoky the Meat Loaf, Grilled Cheese Grilled Sandwich, “EnchiLasagna” or “Lasagnalada”
• Afternoon: Green Grape Cobbler, Crispy Chickpeas, Savory Greek Yogurt Dip
• Evening: Bad Day Bitter Martini, Mussels-O-Miso, Garam Masalmon Steaks
• Anytime: The General’s Fried Chicken, Roasted Chile Salsa, Peach Punch Pops
• Later: Cider House Fondue, Open Sesame Noodles, Chocapocalypse Cookie

Chapter 1


Breakfast Carbonara

Feeds 4 to 6 

The way I look at it, if you’re going to eat pasta on a regular basis, you should probably have it for breakfast so you’ve got the whole day to work it off. With that in mind, I offer this riff on carbonara that delivers eggs, sausage, toast, and even a bit of citrus.

Now . . . where will I put that Nobel.

1 tablespoon grated orange zest

W cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped

W cup fresh bread crumbs

1 tablespoon kosher salt

8 ounces dry linguine, preferably whole wheat

8 ounces breakfast sausage

2 scallions, thinly sliced

4 large eggs, at room temperature

3 ounces finely grated Pecorino Romano

1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1. Combine the orange zest, parsley and bread crumbs in a small bowl. Set aside.

2. Add 2 quarts water, the salt and linguine to a large sauté pan. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 4 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente. 

3. Meanwhile, cook the sausage in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until brown. Add the scallions and cook until fragrant.

4. While the pasta and sausage are cooking, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino and pepper.

5. Drain the pasta, reserving W cup of the starchy water. Add the pasta to the sausage, tossing the pasta to coat in the fat.

6. Remove from the heat, add the egg mixture, and thin as needed with additional pasta water.

7. Serve immediately with a generous sprinkle of the parsley mixture.

Always Perfect Oatmeal

Feeds 2 

If you think about it before going to bed, go ahead and put the water, oats and salt in the pot and let it sit overnight. The cooking will go even faster.

120 grams thick rolled oats (1 cup)

25 grams quinoa (unrinsed) 

475 grams water (2 cups + 2 T)

7 grams kosher salt

Combine, cover and place over low heat. After 15 minutes take a peek. If the water doesn’t seem to be absorbing, re-cover, boost the heat a little and cook another 15 minutes. If at any time you see steam shooting out around from the lid, the heat’s too high. Don’t stir during cooking! If you want to add fruit, do so after cooking. Simply kill the heat, place the fruit on top of the oatmeal mixture, re-cover and wait 5 minutes.

Buttermilk Lassi

Feeds 2 

Although I’ve never personally been to the Indian subcontinent, I’m a huge fan of the various dairy-based beverages that go by the name “lassi.” Most include yogurt and fruit of some type. My favorite home version is built instead on buttermilk, which I always seem to have left over from biscuit making, and mangoes, whose funky terpene flavors (kinda like pinesap) balance the b.milk’s acidic snap.

12 ounces cubed mangoes (2 large specimens)

2 cups buttermilk

1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger

V teaspoon chili powder

V teaspoon kosher salt



4 frozen lassi cubes

V ripe cantaloupe, cubed

1 peach, peeled and pitted, or 1 cup frozen peach slices

V cup plain low-fat yogurt

1-inch-long hunk fresh ginger

V cup almond milk

V teaspoon ground turmeric

Combine the mangoes, buttermilk, ginger, chili powder and salt in a blender. Puree until smooth. Serve immediately.


Or . . .

Freeze in ice cube trays and use to make one of my favorite morning smoothies:

Place the lassi cubes, cantaloupe, peach, yogurt, ginger, almond milk and turmeric in a blender. Blend until smooth, drink and face a grateful planet.

Blueberry Pound Cake

Makes 1 Bundt cake, feeds 12 

The best cakes are cakes that can arguably be served as breakfast, and this pound cake is a prime example. After all, it contains eggs and dairy and flour and fruit. Serve a thick slice, toasted golden brown, slathered with butter and sprinkled with sea salt, alongside a steamy cup of joe and go forth into your day knowing that no matter what else doesn’t get done in your day, you got your cake in. Go you!

8 ounces (2 sticks) plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature

15 ounces plus 2 tablespoons sugar

15 ounces all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking powder

V teaspoon kosher salt

4 large eggs, at room temperature

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 dry pint fresh blueberries (10 ounces or about 2 cups)

1. Heat the oven to 325˚F. Coat a Bundt pan with 1 tablespoon of the butter and 2 tablespoons of the sugar.

2. Cream the remaining 8 ounces butter and remaining 15 ounces sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, sift together 10 ounces of the flour, the baking powder and salt onto a paper plate. 

3. When the butter mixture is pale and fluffy, drop the mixer speed to low and add the eggs, one at a time, waiting for each to be incorporated before adding the next. Follow with the vanilla extract. Then slowly add the flour mixture.

4. Toss the blueberries with the remaining 5 ounces flour. Remove the mixing bowl and fold the berries and flour into the batter with a large rubber spatula. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan.

5. Bake for 75 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 210˚F. Cool in the pan on a cooling rack for 15 minutes before de-panning and cooling.

6. Serve with . . . your hands.

Pho Bo (Beef Pho)

Feeds 4 to 6 

In the United States we have breakfast cereal. There are dozens of different types and styles and we all have our special ways of eating them. In Vietnam, they have pho. Pho equals breakfast cereal. Cook and eat accordingly.

Notice the broth calls for three cuts of beef. You can fudge a bit one way or the other, but I really think this combination makes for a superlative broth, and although the word “pho” actually refers to the rice noodles, the dish is really all about the broth.

Beef Broth 

1 cinnamon stick

6 whole cloves

2 pods star anise

1 teaspoon whole fennel seed

2-ounce chunk fresh ginger, roughly crushed . . . don’t bother peeling

1 onion, cut into thick slices

3 pounds mixed beef shanks and oxtails

1 pound chicken wings

V large Fuji apple, don’t bother peeling

5 teaspoons kosher salt

2 tablespoons fish sauce

1 tablespoon palm sugar

To Serve

8 ounces eye of round, sirloin steak, or London broil, thinly sliced (freeze briefly before slicing)

14 ounces thin rice noodles or “sticks” in the B⁄bg-inch range (banh pho)

3 scallions, thinly sliced

2 Thai bird chiles, thinly sliced

1 cup bean sprouts

2 cups fresh herbs, including cilantro, Thai basil and mint

2 limes, quartered

SPECIAL EQUIPMENT

Pressure cooker, which you should totally have anyway.

1. In a large pressure cooker, toast the spices over medium-high heat until fragrant.

2. Add the ginger and onion and blacken slightly (some of the spices may burn a bit and that’s just fine.

3. Add the meat and bones, wings, apple, salt, sugar and 10 cups of water. Apply the lid according to your cooker’s instructions and bring to full pressure over medium heat. Once the cooker is steaming and whistling, back down on the heat to just maintain full pressure and cook for 30 minutes.

4. Meanwhile, place the eye of round in the freezer for 20 minutes to firm it up, then slice the meat very thinly across the grain. Cover and refrigerate while the broth continues to cook.

5. Remove the broth from the heat and allow to cool naturally for 5 minutes, then slowly remove the pressure.

6. Carefully remove the lid and fish out the meat, vegetables and spices from the broth. Save the shanks and oxtails for serving. Use a fine-mesh strainer to skim any small particles and/or scum from the broth. Stir in fish sauce and palm sugar.

7. When they’re cool enough to handle, slice the cooked shanks.

8. Everything above this line can be done up to a day ahead. When you’re ready to eat, read on.

9. Soak the rice noodles in cold water for 30 minutes, then drain. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil.

10. When you’re really ready to serve, cook the noodles in the water for 10 to 15 seconds so that they are still a bit chewy. Drain thoroughly in a spider.

11. Distribute the noodles into wide soup bowls (better be deep too) and top with the slices of (raw) eye of round and a few pieces of the cooked beef.

12. Cover with hot broth. Serve with the scallions, chiles, sprouts, herbs and limes and let diners garnish as desired.

Inspired by her success, Dr. Ballantyne created the popular health blog www.ThePaleoMom.com and became co-host of a top-rated podcast, The Paleo View. Her passion for providing straightforward explanations of the science behind her diet and lifestyle recommendations for managing autoimmune disease, plus her love of food and cooking as well as her conviction that healing your body does not have to come at the expense of enjoying food, form the foundations of The Paleo Approach and The Paleo Approach Cookbook.","['paleo approach', 'autoimmune disease', 'approach cookbook', 'autoimmune protocol', 'sarah ballantyne', 'cricket flour', 'shopping lists', 'every recipe', 'autoimmune', 'plans and shopping', 'easy to follow', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

If smoked salmon and cream cheese omelets, sautéed jumbo shrimp, and double-patty burgers suit your palate, belly up to the Protein Power diet: ""Not a high protein diet"" but ""an adequate protein diet."" Doctors Michael R. and Mary Dan Eades make a persuasive case in favor of ""the diet we were meant to eat.""
Similar to Dr. Robert Atkins's New Diet Revolution, the authors cite insulin as the main culprit in weight gain and expound the benefits of a diet extremely low in carbohydrates. Carbohydrates, which are changed into sugar during digestion, stimulate the body to store fat, making weight loss virtually impossible. The most revolutionary idea put forth in Protein Power is that the fat you eat has very little bearing on the fat you gain: in other words, we aren't what we eat after all. Researchers have found that eating larger portions of protein in conjunction with severely reduced portions of carbohydrates causes people to burn the excess fat stored in their bodies.
Protein Power is packed with helpful charts and formulas, so you can estimate your body-fat percentage and your ideal weight for your particular body composition. There are worksheets to calculate your protein need and carbohydrate and protein equivalency charts, as well as charts that allow you to track your fat and weight loss. But this book is not all grams and percentages: it also shows you what a day of eating on this diet would look like and includes sample menus and 70 pages of recipes. If you've been starving yourself for years and just can't seem to lose weight, this may be the diet for you. --Jhana Bach

Product Description
My name is Christy Jordan and I like to feed people.
I come from a long line of Southern cooks who taught me home cooking is best, life is good, and there is always something to be grateful for. I created Southern Plate so that I could share the recipes and stories that have been passed down through my family for more than nine generations.
You won't find fancy food or new-fangled recipes in this cookbook—just easy, no-fuss Southern favorites such as Chicken and Dumplings, Homemade Banana Pudding, Aunt Looney's Macaroni Salad, Fried Green Tomatoes, and Daddy's Rise-and-Shine Biscuits. (I want to make one thing as clear as possible: How your mama made it is the right way! I'm going to bring it to you how my mama made it, which is the only right way for me.)
These stories and recipes come from my heart. They are a gift from my ancestors, but the ability to have them heard is a gift from you. Take a seat at the Southern Plate table; you're with family now.
From Southern Plate: Lela’s Fried Fruit Pies

These are my great-grandmother’s pies. I remember Lela standing in the kitchen humming as she fried these, placing the crispy treats on a paper towel–lined plate next to the stove as she dipped more into the hot oil in her cast-iron skillet. The entire house smelled of peaches, because that was her favorite kind of fruit pie.
If you’re yearning for an old-fashioned fried pie like Granny used to make, you’ve come to the right place. This recipe can easily be modified to accommodate your favorite dried fruit. Feel free to modify it to accommodate your own tastes. Most folks start out making these with dried apples but even though we love apples, nothing can beat a fried pie made with dried peaches.


Macaroni and cheese is a must-have whenever kids are around, and there are countless takes on this classic comfort food, so I couldn’t bring you just one. This is the recipe for the baked version, which is for those who prefer stringy, extra cheesy mac and cheese. It’s best made in an ovenproof bowl rather than a 9 x 13-inch pan.

He's bigger than food."" (Anthony Bourdain)
Eddie Huang is the 30-year-old proprietor of Baohaus - the hot East Village hangout where foodies, stoners, and students come to stuff their faces with delicious Taiwanese street food late into the night - and one of the food world's brightest and most controversial young stars. But before he created the perfect home for himself in a small patch of downtown New York, Eddie wandered the American wilderness looking for a place to call his own.
Eddie grew up in theme-park America, on a could-be-anywhere cul-de-sac in suburban Orlando, raised by a wild family of FOB (""fresh off the boat"") hustlers and hysterics from Taiwan. While his father improbably launched a series of successful seafood and steak restaurants, Eddie burned his way through American culture, defying every ""model minority"" stereotype along the way. He obsessed over football, fought the all-American boys who called him a chink, partied like a gremlin, sold drugs with his crew, and idolized Tupac. His anchor through it all was food - from making Southern ribs with the Haitian cooks in his dad's restaurant to preparing traditional meals in his mother's kitchen to haunting the midnight markets of Taipei when he was shipped off to the homeland. After misadventures as an unlikely lawyer, street fashion renegade, and stand-up comic, Eddie finally threw everything he loved - past and present, family, and food - into his own restaurant, bringing together a legacy stretching back to China and the shards of global culture he'd melded into his own identity.
Funny, raw, and moving, and told in an irrepressibly alive and original voice, Fresh Off the Boat recasts the immigrant's story for the 21st century. It's a story of food, family, and the forging of a new notion of what it means to be American.",,,,"['eddie huang', 'hip hop', 'fresh off the boat', 'model minority', 'new york', 'writing style', 'great read', 'asian american', 'law school', 'reading this book', 'asian americans', 'anthony bourdain', 'american dream', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

It's also a primer on nutrition—including facts about green foods, such as spirulina and blue-green algae, and the ""regeneration diets"" used by cancer patients and arthritics—along with an inspiring cookbook with more than 300 mostly vegetarian, nutrient-packed recipes.

The information on Chinese medicine is useful for helping to diagnose health imbalances, especially nascent illnesses. It's smartly paired with the whole-foods program because the Chinese have attributed various health-balancing properties to foods, so you can tailor your diet to help alleviate symptoms of illness. For example, Chinese medicine dictates that someone with low energy and a pale complexion (a yin deficiency) would benefit from avoiding bitter foods and increasing ""sweet"" foods such as soy, black sesame seeds, parsnips, rice, and oats. (Note that the Chinese definition of sweet foods is much different from the American one!)

Pitchford says in his dedication that he hopes the reader finds ""healing, awareness, and peace"" from following his program. The diet is certainly acetic by American standards (no alcohol, caffeine, white flour, fried foods, or sugar, and a minimum of eggs and dairy) but the reasons he gives for avoiding these ""negative energy"" foods are compelling. From the adrenal damage imparted by coffee to immune dysfunction brought on by excess refined sugar, Pitchford spurs you to rethink every dietary choice and its ultimate influence on your health. Without being alarmist, he adds dietary tips for protecting yourself against the dangers of modern life, including neutralizing damage from water fluoridation (thyroid and immune-system problems may result; fluoride is a carcinogen).

As storyteller and chef, Lidia Bastianich draws on anecdotes to educate and illustrate. Recalling lessons learned from her mother, Erminia, and her grandmother Nonna Rosa, Lidia pays homage to the kitchen sages who inspired her. Whether it's Citrus Roasted Veal or Rustic Ricotta Tart, each recipe is a tangible feast. We learn to look at ingredients as both geographic and cultural indicators. In Campania, the region where mozzarella is king, we discover it best eaten three hours after preparation. In Genova we are taught that while focaccia had its basil origins in the Ligurain culinary tradition, the herbs and flavorings will change from region to region; as home chefs, we can experiment with rosemary or oregano or olives or onions! When it's time for dessert, Lidia draws on the scared customs of nuns in Italian monasteries and convents and reveals the secret to rice pudding with a blessing.

Lidia's Commonsense Guide to Italian Cooking is a masterclass in creating delectable Italian dishes with grace, confidence and love.",25461,"From Booklist
Having extensively surveyed the world of Italian and Italian American cooking in previous books and television series, indefatigable and entrepreneurial Bastianich seems bent on creating a new sort of Italian cooking for American kitchens that crosses time-honored boundaries and looks to fashion a more relaxed but no-less-appealing cuisine. She has partnered with her art-historian daughter before, but now the two of them offer readers such uncommon fare as potatoes baked in beer, eggplant and rice parmigiana, and veggie meatballs. Traditionally unadorned pasta carbonara gets some sliced artichokes in its cream-and-egg sauce. Desserts include an apple cake, cookies, and several variations of rice pudding. Most dishes can be readily reproduced, but acquiring razor clams away from the Atlantic coast may be daunting. The authors’ celebrity and their upcoming public-television series mark this a cookbook sure to be in great demand. --Mark Knoblauch

And this cookbook is her best one yet! Absolutely no one will complain when you serve them delicious dishes like Breakfast Tacos, Buffalo Chicken Casserole, Slow Cooker Short Rib Tostadas, Pistachio Rosemary Lamb Chops, and Layered Flourless Chocolate Cake.

For most people, the Paleo or “caveman” diet seems unrealistic. “You expect me not to eat cake anymore?” was Juli’s first reaction. (There may have been a few curse words thrown in there, too.) For Juli, that just wasn’t going to work. We all understand that cavemen didn’t eat cake back in the day, but we’re here in the future, and we can create Paleo-friendly cakes. So Juli ventured out to put a new spin on eating like a caveman. After two weeks of eating Paleo, she knew she was in it for the long haul. She has been eating Paleo for five years now, and she consistently gives her readers Paleo recipes that bring back childhood meal memories or just bring back the foods they love the most. There’s no need to be a true, pretentious caveman if you don’t have to be! We see you using Instagram over there, you modern caveman, you.

Paleo is about so much more than just food. To Juli, Paleo is what gave her the freedom to feel healthy, energetic, and enthusiastic about life.

From Publishers Weekly
Food blogger Amsterdam's latest cookbook is aimed firmly at the growing Paleo diet market, noting that ""a plant-based diet with small amounts of lean animal protein feel less inflated and more energetic."" There is a wealth of options for those looking to eliminate gluten, diary, and grains—but be forewarned she also avoids tomatoes, potatoes, peppers and eggplant. Nevertheless the recipes are worth a try. She uses a great deal of coconut in various forms: coconut flour in Apricot Muffins, coconut oil in Paleo ""Potato"" Leek Soup—cauliflower replaces the potato, and coconut milk in a diary-free whipped cream. For those less keen on coconut, Amsterdam's Honey Lemon Chicken and Avocado Kale Salad will surely please. Unfortunately, all the recipes feel limited by the diet's strict protocols, so only the most restrictive eaters will find the bite worth the buy. (June)

Six years ago, an overweight, pre-diabetic Mark Bittman faced a medical directive: adopt a vegan diet or go on medication. He was no fan of a lifelong regimen of pills, but as a food writer he lived—and worked—to eat. So neither choice was appealing. His solution was a deal with himself. He would become a “flexitarian.”

He adopted a diet heavy in vegetables, fruits, and grains by following a healthy vegan diet (no meat, dairy, or processed foods) all day. After 6:00 p.m. he’d eat however he wanted, though mostly in moderation. Beyond that, his plan involved no gimmicks, scales, calorie counting, or point systems. And there were no so-called forbidden foods—he ate mostly home-cooked meals that were as varied and satisfying as they were delicious.

He called this plan Vegan Before 6:00 (VB6 for short), and the results were swift and impressive. Best of all, they proved to be lasting and sustainable over the long haul. Bittman lost 35 pounds and saw all of his blood numbers move in the right direction.

Using extensive scientific evidence to support his plan, the acclaimed cookbook author and food policy columnist shows why his VB6 approach succeeds when so many other regimens not only fail, but can actually lead to unwanted weight gain. He then provides all the necessary tools for making the switch to a flexitarian diet: lists for stocking the pantry, strategies for eating away from home in a variety of situations, pointers for making cooking on a daily basis both convenient and enjoyable, and a complete 28-day eating plan showing VB6 in action.

Finally, Bittman provides more than 60 recipes for vegan breakfasts, lunches, and snacks, as well as non-vegan dinners that embrace the spirit of a vegetable- and grain-forward diet.",24297,,"About the Author

Six years ago, the man I most trusted with my health said to me, “You should probably become a vegan.”
 
Not exactly the words I’d wanted to hear, and certainly not what I was expecting. But I’d asked Sid Baker, my doctor of thirty years, what he recommended, given that he’d just told me that at age 57, I had developed the pre-diabetic, pre-heart-disease symptoms typical of a middle-aged man who’d spent his life eating without discipline.
 
He’d laid out the depressing facts for me: “Your blood numbers have always been fine but now they’re not. You weigh 40 pounds more than you should. You’re complaining of sleep apnea. You’re talking about knee surgery, which is a direct result of your being overweight. Your cholesterol, which has always been normal up until now, isn’t. Same with your blood sugar; it’s moved into the danger zone.”

A more conventional doc would’ve simply put me on a drug like Lipitor, and maybe a low-fat diet. But Lipitor, one of the statin drugs that lowers cholesterol, is a permanent drug: Once you start taking it, you don’t stop. I didn’t like the idea of that. Furthermore, its effectiveness in healthy people has never been established, and it’s also been implicated in memory loss and other cognitive complications; I didn’t like the idea of any of that, either. And at this point, low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets have essentially been discredited: They might help you lose weight, but they’re not effective for maintaining that loss in the long term, and they may even wreak havoc on your system.
 
But becoming a vegan? A person who eats no animal products at all? Calling that a radical change to my lifestyle was more than a bit of an understatement. Yet it was clear that something had to be done. I asked Sid, “Is a compromise possible? Any other ideas?”
 
“You’re a smart guy,” he said. “Figure something out.”
 
I thought about this for a few days, and I recognized that what he was saying made sense. There are no silver bullets, and over the years it’s become increasingly clear—much as none of us wants to hear it—that the most sensible diet for human health and longevity is one that’s lower in animal products and junk food and higher in vegetables, fruits, legumes, and minimally processed grains.
 
I knew that, and I’m guessing you do, too. Yet the idea of becoming a full-time vegan was neither realistic nor appealing to someone accustomed to eating as widely and as well as I do. Furthermore, I had no interest in becoming an isolated vegan in a world of omnivores and—though I have vegan friends, to be sure—the world of omnivores is where I live. Full time.
 
Yes. I like vegetables and grains; I love them. I love tofu, too, when prepared well. Even back then, I was eating beans far more frequently than I ever had. But none of this got in the way of my enjoying pork shoulder, pizza, bacon, and burgers. I was not prepared to give up that kind of food. That sounded untenable and, more importantly, unsustainable for more than a couple of weeks.
 
So the question became: What could I do with the conflict between what was undoubtedly Sid’s very sound advice—“become a vegan”—and my own established, beloved, well-socialized lifestyle?
 
The answer, to me, was this: I’d become a part-time vegan. And for me, this part-time veganism would follow these simple rules: From the time I woke up in the morning until 6 in the evening, I’d eat a super-strict vegan diet, with no animal products at all.
 
In fact, I decided to go even beyond that: Until 6 p.m., I’d also forgo hyper-processed food, like white bread, white rice, white pasta, of course all junk food, and alcohol.
 
At 6 p.m., I’d become a free man, allowing myself to eat whatever I wanted, usually—but not always—in moderation. Some nights, this meant a steak dinner; some nights, it was a blow-out meal at a good restaurant; other nights, dinner was a tunafish sandwich followed by some cookies. It ran, and runs, the gamut.
 
Whatever happened at dinner, though, the next morning I turned not to bacon and eggs or a bowl of Trix but to oatmeal or fruit or vegetables. For lunch, rice and beans or a salad—or both. Throughout the day I snacked on nuts and more fruit.
 
I called the diet “vegan before six,” or VB6. And it worked.
 
A month later, I weighed myself; I’d lost 15 pounds. A month after that, I went to the lab for blood work: Both my cholesterol and my blood sugar levels were down, well into the normal range (my cholesterol had gone from 240 to 180). My apnea was gone; in fact, for the first time in probably thirty years, I was sleeping through the night, not even snoring. Within four months, I’d lost more than 35 pounds and was below 180—less than I’d weighed in thirty years. And the funny thing was, the way I ate in the daytime began to change the way I ate at night.
 
So why be vegan just until 6 o’clock? Am I suggesting that 6 p.m. is some kind of magical metabolic witching hour? Not at all. Truthfully, the hour itself doesn’t matter much, and if you habitually eat dinner very early, your plan may be VB5—or VB9, if you live in Spain. The point I was making to myself, and that I’m saying to you, is that dinnertime sets you free. Dinnertime, because that’s when you’re likely to want to eat the most, because that’s when you’re most likely to drink (and lose discipline!), because that’s when you’re most likely to combine eating with socializing, an important and even beneficial thing.
 
But even though the time itself is arbitrary, it has the power to make you stop and think before acting. In fact, the rules are what VB6 has in common with “regular” diets; because anyone can say (and many people do), “Eat sensibly, don’t overeat, increase your consumption of fruits and vegetables, eat less junk and high-calorie, low-nutrition foods.” If it were that easy, there’d be no need for diets. But by telling you “Don’t eat animal products or refined foods during the day, and feel free to eat what you like at night,” VB6 gives you the structure you need to exercise limited but effective discipline in a way that accomplishes all of those things.
 
During the day you’ll be observant, and eat way more fruits and vegetables than you probably have until now, and virtually none of the foods that we know cause your metabolism to go haywire, putting a downward spiral in motion. In the evening, you’ll still eat more thoughtfully, but won’t necessarily avoid or limit foods you love and can’t imagine eliminating from your diet. Simply put, at 6 o’clock you can put “the diet” on hold—a compromise that offers the benefits of restraint without the hardship of perpetual denial. Even reading this now, six years after I began, it still sounds pretty good to me.
 
This is not to say that my adapting to VB6 was seamless. I wasn’t exactly “becoming a vegan,” but this new diet was certainly not the way I was used to getting through the day. In 2007, when I first embarked on this plan, I’d been a professional food writer (and eater!) for more than twenty-five years. My diet had become increasingly indulgent and untamed, and my opportunities for eating “well”—that is, lavishly—were near constant. I had few rules and, I thought, little need for them. Like many of us, I ate what tasted good to me.
 
Even before this conversation with Sid, my thinking about food and eating had begun to change—enough so that his suggestion that I become vegan wasn’t completely out of left field. I knew, for example, that we Americans eat too much junk food and too many animal products. I knew that food was being produced in an increasingly mechanized and unprincipled manner, without taking into account the welfare of consumers—that’s us—or the environment or animals or the people who grew or processed it. And I knew that our health as a country was going down the tubes, and that the Standard American Diet (SAD for short, and it is just that) was at least in part responsible.
 
The combination of thinking that way and my new way of eating led to profound changes in my life; it changed not only my diet but my work. I didn’t want to become a preacher or even a teacher, but the more I thought about our diet, the more I practiced VB6, the more I recognized that these changes were essential not only for our health but for that of the planet and many of the things living on it.
 
I began to write not only about cooking but about eating, about I began speaking publicly about the relationships among eating, health, and the environment, and I began changing my work at the : After nearly twenty years of writing about recipes, cooking, and the delights of food, mostly for the Dining section, I branched out to Week In Review and other sections. This led, eventually, to my becoming a Opinion writer, with my main subject being food: how, what, and why we eat, and the forces that affect those things.
 
There’s no lack of subject matter, that’s for sure: Food touches everything. You can’t discuss it without considering the environment, health, the role of animals other than humans in this world, the economy, politics, trade, globalization, or most other important issues. This includes such unlikely and seemingly unrelated matters as global warming: Industrialized livestock production, for example, appears to be accountable for a fifth or more of the greenhouse gases that are causing climate change.
 
But chances are you didn’t buy this book to save the planet, or to improve animal welfare, or even to think about those things. You probably bought this book because you wanted to improve your own health or, even more specifically, because you wanted to lose weight.
 
If that’s the case, you’ve come to the right place, because VB6 can help you do both of those things. My own weight has stabilized and my health has improved over the course of the last six years, and VB6 can do the same for you and help you to do it, not with some two-week snake-oil miracle cure—though you’ll probably see changes for the better in the first two weeks you’re on this diet, if you take it seriously—but with an easy-to-make change that you’ll want to stick to for the rest of your life. And best of all, you will be able to do just that while eating as well as (or better than) you ever have before, and without denying yourself food you really love.

|About the author
The Hubb Community Kitchen in London is a group of women who have come together to prepare fresh food for their community.
 
After being displaced following the Grenfell tower fire, some of the local women needed a place to cook fresh food for their families. They began to use the kitchen at the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre, where the women who worked there had been using the facilities to cook for the community. They all shared the kitchen for two days every week, preparing food and eating together. Word spread and more local women began to join in, embracing community and supporting their neighbors in their time of need.
 
Soon there were women from different cultures all cooking, swapping recipes, talking and laughing. As they cooked, they began to connect, heal and look forward, and have continued to cook together twice a week.
 
This community of women became known as the Hubb Community Kitchen—Hubb means “love” in Arabic. The women of the Hubb Community Kitchen describe it as a place of good food, love, support and friendship.
 
The Royal Foundation is administering the transfer of funds from the sales of Together to the Hubb Community Kitchen and related community projects.
 
The women of the Hubb Community Kitchen in London invite you to make their favorite simple dishes for your loved ones.

Irritable bowel syndrome is one of our nation's most untalked-about ailments, but millions of people - mostly women - suffer from the debilitating condition, one that must be controlled primarily through diet. Contrary to what many sufferers believe, eating for IBS does not mean deprivation, never going to restaurants, boring food, or an unhealthily limited diet. It does mean cutting out such trigger foods as red meat, dairy, most fats, caffeine, alcohol, and insoluble fiber. Heather Van Vorous, who has suffered from IBS since age 9 and gradually learned how to control her IBS symptoms through dietary modifications, collects here 175 recipes she has created over 20 years. Those suffering from IBS, lactose intolerance, Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, and other digestive disorders will be thrilled to discover that they can enjoy traditional homestyle cooking, international foods, rich desserts, snacks, and party foods - and don't have to cook weird or special meals for themselves while their families follow a ""normal"" diet. Eating for IBS will forever revolutionize the way people with IBS eat--and live.",23313,"Review

If you are one of the nearly 100 million Americans struggling with high cholesterol, then Dr. Janet Brill offers you a revolutionary new plan for taking control of your health—without the risks of statin drugs. With Dr. Brill’s breakthrough Cholesterol Down Plan, you simply add nine “miracle foods” to your regular diet and thirty minutes of walking to your daily routine. That’s all. This straightforward and easy-to-follow program can lower your LDL (“bad”) cholesterol by as much as 47 percent in just four weeks.
Cholesterol Down explains Dr. Brill’s ten-point plan as well as the science behind it. You’ll learn how each miracle food affects LDL cholesterol and how the foods work together for maximum effect, as well as:
• How eating whole grains helps reduce LDL cholesterol in your bloodstream
• Why antioxidants keep plaque from building up in your arteries
• How certain steps change the structure of LDL cholesterol particles (and why it’s best for them to be large and fluffy)
• Why walking just thirty minutes a day lowers “bad” cholesterol and cuts dangerous belly fat
With everything you need to stay focused on the plan, including a daily checklist, a six-month chart for racking LDL cholesterol changes, tools for assessing your risk level for cardiovascular disease, sample weekly menus, and even heart-healthy recipes, Cholesterol Down is the safe and effective alternative or complement to statin drugs.",8044,"Review

For many years I have had the urge to describe that treasure trove, lest it vanish forever. So, partly in response to the basic human instinct to share feelings and experiences, and partly for the sheer joy and excitement of it all, I report on my early life. It was quite a romp.

So begins Mildred Kalish’s story of growing up on her grandparents’ Iowa farm during the depths of the Great Depression. With her father banished from the household for mysterious transgressions, five-year-old Mildred and her family could easily have been overwhelmed by the challenge of simply trying to survive. This, however, is not a tale of suffering.

Kalish counts herself among the lucky of that era. She had caring grandparents who possessed—and valiantly tried to impose—all the pioneer virtues of their forebears, teachers who inspired and befriended her, and a barnyard full of animals ready to be tamed and loved. She and her siblings and their cousins from the farm across the way played as hard as they worked, running barefoot through the fields, as free and wild as they dared.

Filled with recipes and how-tos for everything from catching and skinning a rabbit to preparing homemade skin and hair beautifiers, apple cream pie, and the world’s best head cheese (start by scrubbing the head of the pig until it is pink and clean), Little Heathens portrays a world of hardship and hard work tempered by simple rewards. There was the unsurpassed flavor of tender new dandelion greens harvested as soon as the snow melted; the taste of crystal clear marble-sized balls of honey robbed from a bumblebee nest; the sweet smell from the body of a lamb sleeping on sun-warmed grass; and the magical quality of oat shocking under the light of a full harvest moon.

Little Heathens offers a loving but realistic portrait of a “hearty-handshake Methodist” family that gave its members a remarkable legacy of kinship, kindness, and remembered pleasures. Recounted in a luminous narrative filled with tenderness and humor, Kalish’s memoir of her childhood shows how the right stuff can make even the bleakest of times seem like “quite a romp.”",214387,"Review
“This lovely book, so unaffected and so generous, opens the door to a past I knew as a child in Iowa, and I wept with joy and recognition as I read it. It deserves a distinguished place next to Hamlin Garland’s Son of the Middle Border but, with its deep humility, it would also fit, without a single word of protest, next to the Betty Crocker Cookbook.”—Ted Kooser, U. S. poet laureate, 2004-2006

“Little Heathens is an enchanting but thoroughly unsentimental look at rural life in the Great Depression.  In clear clean prose we are offered the grit, struggle, and also the joy of hard work on a farm.  I cherish this book for its quite naked honesty and quiet lyricism about a time which makes our current problems nearly childish.  This is a fine book.”—Jim Harrison, author of Legends of the Fall

“Now that cell phones are a way of life, you won’t find a better way to participate in the Good Old Days. Whether you are of farm origins or not, Little Heathens is a bit of history begging to be borrowed. Like a neighborly cup of sugar, it will sweeten your modern-day life.”—MaryJane Butters, author of MaryJane’s Ideabook, Cookbook, Lifebook for the Farmgirl In All Of Us

“Using this book alone, one could reconstruct, with glorious exactness, a lost time and place.  Mildred Kalish has a novelist's eye for detail and a beautiful understanding of what the gestures of daily life mean.  A lovely, wise, transporting memoir.”—Joan Silber, author of Ideas of Heaven: A Ring of Stories

""Not only trustworthy and useful, but also polished by real, rare happiness. It is a very good book, indeed. In fact, it's averyveryverygoodbook.""—New York Times Book Review

""Unpretentious yet deeply intelligent ... [] radiates the joy of a vanished way of life.... In prose that never yields to mawkish sentimentality, Kalish details the roles of family, religion, thrift, and education in her upbringing.""–

""Not only trustworthy and useful, but also polished by real, rare happiness. It is a very good book, indeed. In fact, it's averyveryverygoodbook.""—Elizabeth Gilbert,

"" made me ache for my own Depression-era Grandma, with her hand-cranked clothes wringer and her North Dakotan speech tut-tutting.... This is a book to awaken your family's own half-remembered stories - or better, to send you back to your elders to scour up your own.”—

From the author of the landmark bestseller Dr. Dean Ornish’s Program for Reversing Heart Disease comes an empowering new program that teaches you how to lower high blood pressure, lose weight, lower your cholesterol, or reverse a major disease by customizing a healthy way of eating and living based on your own desires, needs, and genetic predispositions.

Dr. Dean Ornish revolutionized medicine by directing clinical research proving–for the first time–that heart disease and early-stage prostate cancer may be stopped or even reversed by his program of comprehensive lifestyle changes, without drugs or surgery. His newest research was the first to show that changing your lifestyle changes your genes in men with prostate cancer–“turning on” disease-preventing genes, and “turning off” genes that promote breast cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses, and in only three months. This study documented, also for the first time, that these lifestyle changes may significantly increase an enzyme that lengthens telomeres–the ends of your chromosomes that control how long you live. As your telomeres get longer, your life gets longer. Your genes are not your fate.

Featuring one hundred easy-to-prepare, delicious recipes from award-winning chef Art Smith, The Spectrum can make a powerful difference in your health and well-being.

If you want to see where medicine is likely to be five or ten years from now, read this book today.”—President Bill Clinton

A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR
 
I first learned to love this bread while visiting the Community of the Ark, a utopian society founded in France by an Italian disciple of Gandhi. On my return home, a friend taught me how to make the same bread -- or pretty close. Some further experimenting ended up with the method in this booklet. If you've made other breads, you'll find it refreshingly simple. No matter how much of this bread I've eaten, I've never grown tired of it.

She may be 35th in line for the throne, but Lady Georgiana Rannoch cannot wait to ring in the new year-before a Christmas killer wrings another neck...
On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me-well, actually, my true love, Darcy O'Mara, is spending a feliz navidad tramping around South America. Meanwhile, Mummy is holed up in a tiny village called Tiddleton-under-Lovey with that droll Noel Coward!

The Bread Bible gives bread bakers 150 of the meticulous, foolproof recipes that are Rose Levy Beranbaum's trademark. Her knowledge of the chemistry of baking, the accessibility of her recipes, and the incomparable taste of her creations make this book invaluable for home cooks and professional bakers alike.
""Understanding"" and ""Pointers for Success"" sections explain in simple, readable language the importance of various techniques and ingredients demonstrated in a recipe, providing a complete education in the art of baking, with thorough sections on types of flour, equipment, and other essentials. Easy-to-use ingredient tables provide both volume and weight, for surefire recipes that work perfectly every time.
Recipes include bread made with yeast starters, quick breads, flatbreads, brioche, and much more. From ciabatta, semolina, rye, and sourdough breads to bagels, biscuits, crumpets, and pizza dough, The Bread Bible covers all the baking bases.
225 line drawings and 32 pages of color illustrations",11803,"Amazon.com Review
Rose Levy Beranbaum's The Cake Bible introduced readers to a newly illuminating baking-book approach--a precisely detailed yet accessible recipe format emphasizing baking science. The Bread Bible follows the same plan, offering 150 recipes, arranged by type, for a great variety of baked goods--from muffins, popovers, and English muffins to sandwich loaves, focaccia, rolls, hearth breads, rye bread, challah, and more, with a particularly vivid (and passionate) stop at sourdough loaves. Instruction is abetted by 32 pages of photos plus 300 step-by-step illustrations that depict, for example, bagel forming, in exact, imitable detail. In addition, an introductory section, ""The Ten Essential Steps of Making Bread,"" includes a particularly lucid discussion on the way yeast works plus an invaluable comparison of kneading methods. Like the book's final look at ingredients, these ""mini-texts"" provide information uncommon to most home bread books, rendered in simple language that allays fears of putting one's hand in the dough.
All this is impressive indeed, and readers bitten by the bread-baking bug will welcome the ultra-thorough Beranbaum approach. The less committed may find her technical demands too painstaking (her baguette recipe requires two starters, for example; though simpler loaves are, of course, offered) or even impractical (ingredient quantities using grams are sometimes given in minute fractions, requiring a special scale). The frequent inclusion of alternate mixing methods and equipment options can also make the formulas unwieldy. On the other hand, features like Pointers for Success and Understanding often yield exciting discovery as well as rewarding results. In short, this Beranbaum bible answers virtually every bread-making question, as well as providing exemplary formulas. It's the real deal for those willing to bake along with Rose. --Arthur Boehm
From Publishers Weekly
As in her seminal The Cake Bible, which won an IACP prize, Beranbaum doesn't just offer recipes here; she dissects them, explains how they work, then puts them back together again with a number of variations. The front matter to what Beranbaum terms her ""bread biography"" contains perhaps the best explanation anywhere of how yeast works and a description of the sponge method used for almost every yeast-risen bread. Each recipe also includes a ""Rose ratio,"" which shows at a glance the percentage of water, yeast, flour and fat in each bread. The author's discussion of the pros and cons of various kneading methods (bread machine, by hand, etc.) is invaluable. After all this information, bakers will be eager to get to the recipes, which are equally rewarding. Beranbaum covers everything from a Chocolate Bread made with cocoa nibs to a Traditional Challah. Recipes are arranged by type of bread, with groups including sandwich loaves and dinner rolls and brioche breads. A chapter on artisanal hearth breads includes Heart of Wheat Bread, with wheat germ for extra crunch, and New Zealand Almond and Fig Bread with an apricot glaze. Every time Beranbaum seems about to go overboard with too much information, she steps back from the brink, as in the excellent introduction to sourdough, where she thoroughly explains how sourdough works, then provides a simple box with eight rules for making a starter. Beranbaum could have a second career as a scientist, but luckily for home bakers she seems intent on creating a library of seminal cookbooks instead.

Fresh from the Vegan Slow-Cooker provides practical guidence on how to work with different models of slow-cookers, taking into account the sizes of various machines, the variety of settings they offer, and the quirks and personalities of each device.

There are homey and comforting foods in the American and European style, such as a Rustic Pot Pie Topped with Chive Biscuits and a Ziti with Mushroom and Bell Pepper Ragu, and there are lots of East Asian, South and Southeast Asian, and Mexican/Latin dishes, too.

Eighteen robust chilis and stews - two more categories that do well in the slow-cooker - include a warming Chipotle Black Bean Chili with Winter Squash and a surprising but yummy Seitan Stroganoff. Beyond the mains, there are chapters devoted to snacks and appetizers, desserts, breads and breakfasts, and even one on drinks. The many soy-free and gluten-free recipes are clearly identified.

Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.

Introduction The irresistible appeal of a slow-cooker is its convenience and simplicity. Turn it on, and it cooks dinner while you do other things. You have no pot to watch. It doesnt burn or spill over. Just set it and let it do its work. Next thing you know, your kitchen smells heavenly, like a home-cooked meal, and you feel like your personal chef did all the work. Slow-cookers first appeared in the 1970s, and you could get your crock pot in harvest gold, avocado green, or maybe decorated with orange flowers. Back then, the Crock-Pot (as the Rival Company, which is now a brand of Sunbeam Products, trademarked it) was mostly favored for cooking tough cuts of meat. The Crock-Pot left the limelight for a while, but in 2002, when I wrote my first slow-cooker cookbook (Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker, The Harvard Common Press), slow-cookers were enjoying a comeback. The goal of my first slow cooker book was to show how versatile slow-cookers are for vegetarian cooking and can be used to prepare everything from breakfast to dessert. Fast forward ten years from that first book, and the popularity of slow-cookers shows no sign of waning. In addition, more people are enjoying a plant-based diet than ever before. Since that first slow-cooker cookbook was published, I've written many other titles, but I never stopped developing new recipes, discovering new techniques, and exploring new ideas for vegan slow-cooking. As I've explored new ways to use the slow-cooker for plant-based meals, I've been continually amazed at the effectiveness of slow cookers for vegan recipes. Over the years, I have developed scores of new recipes and explored the worlds cuisines to discover more creative ways to prepare food using the slow-cooker method. What I came up with was enough to fill another book. I'm pleased and proud, therefore, to present this new book to you. It contains more than 200 recipes using only plant-based ingredients. I've also included pages of basic information and lots of new tips and pointers for making the most of your slow cooker experience. I've worked hard to make the recipes accessible using most sizes of slow-cookers. In addition to being 100 percent plant-based, many of the recipes are also gluten-free, soy-free, or low in fat. We all know that a slow-cooker is ideal for cooking beans, soups, and stews, but as you explore the pages of Fresh From the Vegan Slow-Cooker, you'll discover a whole new slow-cooking world. The slow-cooker can be used to make braised vegetable dishes, comforting casseroles, luxurious risottos, and fun dips and snacks. It can even be used to bake potatoes, breads, pates, and desserts.

Mounting scientific research is confirming that eating a ketogenic diet could represent one of the greatest nutritional breakthroughs of our time—and that it might be the healthiest and most effective weight loss strategy ever. Going “keto” by eating high fat, low-to-moderate protein and low-carb foods enables you to break free from the disastrous effects of carbohydrate dependency by resetting your metabolism and promoting metabolic flexibility—where your body learns to burns fat instead of sugar for energy, even when you go off plan.
 
Unlike many other ketogenic programs that require challenging restrictions and deprivation or offer misinformation, Mark Sisson, bestselling author of The Primal Blueprint and publisher of the #1 paleo blog MarksDailyApple.com, presents a unique two-step, scientifically validated approach for going keto the right way.  He first reveals the real secret to rapid and sustained weight loss, which is in becoming ""fat-adapted"" before entering full nutritional ketosis. This process allows your body to learn to burn fat more efficiently, resulting in increased and sustained weight loss over the long-term.  It takes as little as 21-days to reprogram your metabolism to burn fat for fuel, by ditching processed grains, sugars, and refined vegetable oils in favor of nutrient-dense, high fat, primal/paleo foods--and you'll see immediate results. Next, you’ll fine-tune with Intermittent Fasting and then foray into full ketogenic eating for a further weight loss boost and improved health.  

With The Keto Reset Diet, you can eat to total satisfaction by enjoying rich, high-satiety foods, and even weather occasional slip-ups. You’ll use keto as a lifelong tool to stay trim, healthy, energetic, and free from the disastrous health conditions caused by the typical American diet. With step-by-step guidance, daily meal plans and a recipe section with over 100 delicious keto-friendly recipes, this is the definitive guide to help the keto-beginner or the experienced health enthusiast understand the what, why, and how to succeed with ketogenic eating.",4501,"Review

Les Jardins de la Grelinette is a micro-farm located in Eastern Quebec, just north of the American border. Growing on just 1.5 acres, owners Jean-Martin and Maude-Helene feed more than 200 families through their thriving CSA and seasonal market stands and supply their signature mesclun salad mix to dozens of local establishments. The secret of their success is the low-tech, high-yield production methods they've developed by focusing on growing better rather than growing bigger, making their operation more lucrative and viable in the process.
The Market Gardener is a compendium of La Grelinette's proven horticultural techniques and innovative growing methods. This complete guide is packed with practical information on:
Setting-up a micro-farm by designing biologically intensive cropping systems, all with negligible capital outlay;
Farming without a tractor and minimizing fossil fuel inputs through the use of the best hand tools, appropriate machinery and minimum tillage practices;
Growing mixed vegetables systematically with attention to weed and pest management, crop yields, harvest periods and pricing approaches.
Inspired by the French intensive tradition of maraichage and by iconic American vegetable grower Eliot Coleman, author and farmer Jean-Martin shows by example how to start a market garden and make it both very productive and profitable. Making a living wage farming without big capital outlay or acreages may be closer than you think.",9981,"Review

When Laura Vitale moved from Naples to the United States at age twelve, she cured her homesickness by cooking up endless pots of her nonna’s sauce. She went on to work in her father’s pizzeria, but when his restaurant suddenly closed, she knew she had to find her way back into the kitchen.

At Greens restaurant in San Francisco, where she was the founding chef, and in her two acclaimed vegetarian cookbooks, Madison elevated vegetarian cooking to new heights of sophistication, introducing many people to the joy of cooking without meat, whether occasionally or for a lifetime.  But after her many years as a teacher and writer, she realized that there was no comprehensive primer for vegetarian cooking, no single book that taught vegetarians basic cooking techniques, how to combine ingredients, and how to present vegetarian dishes with style.  Now, in a landmark cookbook that has been six years in the making, Madison teaches readers how to build flavor into vegetable dishes, how to develop vegetable stocks, and how to choose, care for, and cook the many vegetables available to cooks today.

Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone is the most comprehensive vegetarian cookbook ever published.  The 1,400 recipes, which range from appetizers to desserts, are colorful and imaginative as well as familiar and comforting.  Madison introduces readers to innovative main course salads; warm and cold soups; vegetable braises and cobblers; golden-crusted gratins; Italian favorites like pasta, polenta, pizza, and risotto; savory tarts and galettes; grilled sandwiches and quesadillas; and creative dishes using grains and heirloom beans.  At the heart of the book is the A-to-Z vegetable chapter, which describes the unique personalities of readily available vegetables, the sauces and seasonings that best complement them, and the simplest ways to prepare them.  ""Becoming a Cook"" teaches cooking basics, from holding a knife to planning a menu, and ""Foundations of Flavor"" discusses how to use sauces, herbs, spices, oils, and vinegars to add flavor and character to meatless dishes.  In each chapter, the recipes range from those suitable for everyday dining to dishes for special occasions.  And through it all, Madison presents a philosophy of cooking that is both practical and inspiring.

Despite its focus on meatless cooking, Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone is not just for vegetarians: It's for everyone interested in learning how to cook vegetables creatively, healthfully, and passionately.  The recipes are remarkably straightforward, using easy-to-find ingredients in inspiring combinations.  Some are simple, others more complex, but all are written with an eye toward the seasonality of produce.  And Madison's joyful and free-spirited approach to cooking will send you into the kitchen with confidence and enthusiasm.  Whether you are a kitchen novice or an experienced cook, this wonderful cookbook has something for everyone.",111703,"Amazon.com Review
The elegant simplicity and exquisite flavor of Deborah Madison's food make her one of America's leading cooks. In Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone, she offers more than great food: her book includes comprehensive information about ingredients and techniques, plus more than 800 recipes. The recipes range from dishes as familiar as Guacamole to those as distinctive as Green Lentils with Roasted Beets and Preserved Lemons, and Cashew Curry. The 124-page chapter titled ""Vegetables: The Heart of the Matter"" is a virtual book of culinary revelations; you could use it as a manual on buying and preparing vegetables. Madison provides equally inspired recipes and guidance for everything from grains and soy to dairy foods and desserts.

Through a lifetime of chronic medical ailments, including severe digestive issues, recurrent infections and, most devastatingly, a battle with thyroid cancer, there was never a point when Tana felt consistently healthy. Doctors ascribed her poor health to genetics, bad luck, and a family history of obesity and heart disease. But even when Tana committed to a standard fitness and eating regimen, her health failed to improve.That's when she realized that she needed to make a real change. She needed to figure out how to improve her health . . . for good.
The Omni Diet is the culmination of a decade-long quest by Tana Amen to study the relationship between food and the body, and to understand how proper nutrition not only impacts weight loss, but actually holds the key to reversing chronic disease, decreasing inflammation, healing the body, and dramatically improving quality of life.
So what is The Omni Diet?
It's an easy-to-follow plan based on a 70/30 plant-to-protein model. This is not a restrictive diet or another page in the high-protein vs. vegetarian diet wars, but a universal map to better health, one that Tana has distilled into a lean six-week program. It offers a simple plan that provides an abundance of illness-fighting nutrients from plant-based foods and high-quality protein to keep the brain sharp and muscles and organs functioning at peak condition. The balance of 70% plant-based foods and 30% protein restores energy, slashes risk of disease, optimizes brain and hormone functioning, produces dramatic weight loss, and promotes health from the inside out.

Ramsay will offer simple, accessible recipes with a ""wow"" factor. Gordon has travelled the world from India and the Far East to LA and Europe, and the recipes in this book will draw all these culinary influences together to show us simple, vibrant and delicious recipes that reflect the way we eat today. For example: Miso braised salmon fillet with Asian vegetables, Pork and Bacon slider with home made bbq sauce, Curried Sweetcorn Soup, Wild Mushroom Risotto Arrancini, and Baked Lemon Cheesecake with Raspberries.

Each chapter will concentrate on a different area of cooking--from the classics to the secret of cooking with Chili and spice, through roasting, baking, and helpful sections on cooking good food for less and cooking for a crowd. Woven into the book will be useful tricks and tips--from ways to save time and money, to cleaning and prepping ingredients, to pan frying like a pro.

Stuffed full of delicious recipes, invaluable tips and lashings of Gordon's trademark cheeky wit, Gordon Ramsay's Home Cooking is the ultimate cooking lesson from the ultimate chef.",6113,"From Booklist
Food-television enthusiasts familiar with Ramsay’s tough and abrasive broadcast personality may not think of him as a home cook, but the chef sets himself to prove that good cooking need not be complicated or unattainable for the domestic market. He scales beef Wellington back to something more affordable by eliminating foie gras in favor of ham. Coconut pancakes get an added tropical touch topped with mango slices and lime syrup. A hefty dose of chili peppers cuts lamb shanks’ customary richness. Ramsay’s cuisine draws on many traditions. Szechuan peppercorns spice chicken thighs, and chipotle peppers enhance ears of corn in the style of Mexican street vendors. Jamaican jerk chicken lacks no little fire, and even Ramsay’s chocolate mousse has a bit of chili. A section with recipes to serve just two can impress a date with seemingly effortless cooking. Ramsay’s media presence will boost demand for this volume. --Mark Knoblauch

Mamrie Hart is a drinking star with a Youtube problem. With over a million subscribers to her cult-hit video series “You Deserve a Drink,” Hart has been entertaining viewers with a combination of tasty libations and raunchy puns since 2011. Hart also co-wrote/co-starred in Dirty Thirty and Camp Takota with Grace Helbig and Hannah Hart.

Finally, Hart has compiled her best drinking stories—and worst hangovers—into one hilarious volume. From the spring break where she and her girlfriends avoided tan lines by staying at an all-male gay nudist resort, to the bachelorette party where she accidentally hired a sixty-year-old meth head to teach the group pole dancing (not to mention the time she lit herself on fire during a Flaming Lips concert), Hart accompanies each story with an original cocktail recipe, ensuring that You Deserve a Drink is as educational as it is entertaining.  
 
With cameos from familiar friends from the YouTube scene and a foreword by Grace Helbig, this glimpse into Hart’s life brings warmth and humor to the woman fans know and love. And for readers who haven’t met Mamrie yet—take a warm-up shot and break out the cocktail shaker: you’re going to need a drink.

“My Mom and I had Mamrie on IN BED WITH JOAN and we absolutely fell in love with her! She carries her wit in the palm of her hand, usually along with a delicious cocktail.

“Funny, heart-hammering, wise…An extremely beautiful book.” —The New York Times

“A Book that should join those few that every literate person will have to read.” —The Boston Globe

Abandoned by her wanderlusting husband, stoic Pearl raised her three children on her own. Now grown, the siblings are inextricably linked by their memories—some painful--which hold them together despite their differences. Hardened by life’s disappointments, wealthy, charismatic Cody has turned cruel and envious. Thrice-married Jenny is errant and passionate. And Ezra, the flawed saint of the family, who stayed at home to look after his mother, runs a restaurant where he cooks what other people are homesick for, stubbornly yearning for the perfect family he never had. Now gathered during a time of loss, they will reluctantly unlock the shared secrets of their past and discover if what binds them together is stronger than what tears them apart.
Soulful and redemptive—full of heartbreak and hope—this portrait of a family will remind you why Anne Tyler is one of the most beloved writers working today.

These recipes feature easy-to-find, low-carb ingredients that will fit any budget. More than just a cookbook, Livin' Low Carb is a practical guide to a sustainable low-carb lifestyle.",93749,"Amazon.com Review
George Stella's Livin' Low Carb has little in common with diet books: In fact, it's got more in common with a cookbook you might have bought for yourself when you first moved out on your own. The style is casual and approachable, with no tense lists of diet-related details or overly-complex recipes, and cooking techniques require little more than a working stove and a frying pan.
George Stella (along with pastry chef-wife Rachel) have developed a wide range of recipes designed to compliment Atkins and other low-carb diet regimens. Rather than relying on packaged convenience foods that meet these dietary standards, they focus on home-cooked meals that satisfy the demands of low carb life without tasting like they were baked up in a factory. Flavors include Chinese (Szechuan stir-fry), Italian-American (clams casino), Southern (fried chicken), and American sweets (chocolate chip muffins and no-bake Key lime cheesecake). Snacks, salads, entrees, and desserts all see equal amounts of attention.
There's a heavy reliance on the sugar substitute Splenda, but in general this is real food for daily life. The condiment chapter contains homemade versions of ketchup, mustard sauce, barbecue sauce and even Thousand Island dressing, and makes a simple place to get started even if the only kitchen appliance you're comfortable with is a can opener. Each recipe clearly notes ""special equipment"" (like 8-inch square pans) as well as the yield, net carbs per serving, and separate times needed for prepping and cooking.
Because of the sugar substitute and number of recipes that alter classics in ways that compromise traditional textures in favor of lowering carbs (such as noodle-free lasagna), the book is most likely to be used by dieters, rather than all home cooks. Still, if you're looking for easy ways to tinker with your food intake that doesn't involve packaged mixes from the diet industry, Stella offers plenty of tasty options. --Jill Lightner

From Publishers Weekly
The low-carb diet may be a popular fad, but for Stella (host of Food Networks Low Carb and Lovin It) its a permanent way of life. By the time he was 40, Stella weighed 467 lbs. and was suffering from congestive heart failure. On a whim, he and his wife decided to try eating a diet low in carbs. Much to their surprise, they both began losing weight while eating things they used to think were off-limits (like bacon, eggs and real butter). Stella never looked back after that. As a great food lover and professional chef, he wanted to make low-carb foods enjoyable and knew he had the ability to do so. Through much trial and error, he came up with what are now his favorite recipes, compiled in his very own cookbook. First, he explains his food plan, playfully stressing that he is a chef, not a doctor. He lists seven simple rules for following the plan, and then delves into his recipes. Each one has a personal introduction, and most also include helpful ""Cooks Tips"" and useful inside info (like which brand names he prefers for certain recipes). Stellas enthusiastic, friendly style is enticing, just like his food, and his recipes reflect his lively personality, making them doubly appetizing. Anyone who fears the dreaded diet deprivation will be delighted to find recipes such as Bald Calzone, Low-Carb Pizza, Georges Gorgeous Macadamia Banana Muffins and Stella Style New York Ricotta Cheesecake. Equally delightful is his claim that ""when youre low-carbing Stella Style, you dont have to quit eating until youre full.""

We see young Jacques as a homesick six-year-old boy in war-ravaged France, working on a farm in exchange for food, dodging bombs, and bearing witness as German soldiers capture his father, a fighter in the Resistance. Soon Jacques is caught up in the hurly-burly action of his mother's café, where he proves a natural. He endures a literal trial by fire and works his way up the ladder in the feudal system of France’s most famous restaurant, finally becoming Charles de Gaulle’s personal chef, watching the world being refashioned from the other side of the kitchen door.

When he comes to America, Jacques immediately falls in with a small group of as-yet-unknown food lovers, including Craig Claiborne, James Beard, and Julia Child, whose adventures redefine American food. Through it all, Jacques proves himself to be a master of the American art of reinvention: earning a graduate degree from Columbia University, turning down a job as John F. Kennedy’s chef to work at Howard Johnson’s, and, after a near-fatal car accident, switching careers once again to become a charismatic leader in the revolution that changed the way Americans approached food. Included as well are forty all-time favorite recipes created during the course of a career spanning nearly half a century, from his mother’s utterly simple cheese soufflé to his wife’s pork ribs and red beans.

The Apprentice is the poignant and sometimes funny tale of a boy’s coming of age. Beyond that, it is the story of America’s culinary awakening and the transformation of food from an afterthought to a national preoccupation.",100702,"Review

Chang relays with candor the tale of his unwitting rise to superstardom, which, though wracked with mishaps, happened at light speed. And the dishes shared in this book are coveted by all who've dined—or yearned to—at any Momofuku location (yes, the pork buns are here). This is a must-read for anyone who truly enjoys food.",6303,"Amazon.com Review
From Momofuku: Ginger Scallion Noodles and Ginger Scallion Sauce
Our ginger scallion noodles are an homage to/out-and-out rip-off of one of the greatest dishes in New York City: the $4.95 plate of ginger scallion noodles at Great New York Noodletown down on the Bowery in Chinatown.
Ginger scallion sauce is one of the greatest sauces or condiments ever. Ever. It’s definitely a mother sauce at Momofuku, something that we use over and over and over again. If you have ginger scallion sauce in the fridge, you will never go hungry: stir 6 tablespoons into a bowl of hot noodles--lo mein, rice noodles, Shanghai thick noodles--and you’re in business. Or serve over a bowl of rice topped with a fried egg. Or with grilled meat or any kind of seafood. Or almost anything.
At Noodle Bar, we add a few vegetables to the Noodletown dish to appease the vegetarians, add a little sherry vinegar to the sauce to cut the fat, and leave off the squirt of hoisin sauce that Noodletown finishes the noodles with. (Not because it’s a bad idea or anything, just that we’ve got hoisin in our pork buns, and too much hoisin in a meal can be too much of a good thing. Feel free to add it back.)
The dish goes something like this: boil 6 ounces of ramen noodles, drain, toss with 6 tablespoons Ginger Scallion Sauce (below); top the bowl with 1/4 cup each of Bamboo Shoots (page 54 of Momofuku); Quick-Pickled Cucumbers (page 65 of Momofuku); pan-roasted cauliflower (a little oil in a hot wide pan, 8 or so minutes over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the florets are dotted with brown and tender all the way through; season with salt); a pile of sliced scallions; and a sheet of toasted nori. But that’s because we’ve always got all that stuff on hand. Improvise to your needs, but know that you need ginger scallion sauce on your noodles, in your fridge, and in your life. For real.-- David Chang

From Publishers Weekly
Starred Review. Chang, master restaurateur and chef, and Meehan, a New York Times food writer, join forces in this stellar collection of recipes from Chang's restaurants—Momofuku, Ssäm Bar and Ko. Chang is a man possessed with a deep love of ramen and a clear passion for food. This book pays tribute to the humble noodle, which Chang has elevated to a near art form, and the wide array of cuisine he serves. Filled with 150 gorgeous, full-color photos and an engrossing narrative, this book is a treat for the eye, mind and palate. Chang's special touches are seen in every dish. Chicken wings are cooked with bacon in rendered pork or duck fat, and pan-roasted asparagus are adorned with poached eggs and miso butter. Fried (or roasted) cauliflower is drizzled with fish sauce vinaigrette, and roasted New Jersey diver scallops are served with kohlrabi puree and iwa nori. Of course, recipes for noodles abound, including Momofuku ramen, ginger scallion noodles, and Alkaline Noodles. Other staples include ramen broth, ramen toppings, and rice with miso soup. Be forewarned: Chang gears the cookbook to only the most experienced of cooks, with many dishes requiring several steps. Nevertheless, Chang presents a collection both stunning and engaging. (Oct.)

Imagine what you could do with eighteen delicious new greens in your dining arsenal including purslane, chickweed, curly dock, wild spinach, sorrel, and wild mustard.
John Kallas makes it fun and easy to learn about foods you've unknowingly passed by all your life. Through gorgeous photographs, playful, but authoritative text, and ground-breaking design he gives you the knowledge and confidence to finally begin eating and enjoying edible wild plants.

This field guide is essential for anyone wanting to incorporate more natural and whole foods into their diet. First ever nutrient tables that directly compare wild foods to domesticated greens are included. Whether looking to enhance a diet or identify which plants can be eaten for survival, the extensive information on wild foods will help readers determine the appropriate stage of growth and how to properly prepare these highly nutritious greens.
John Kallas is one of the foremost authorities on North American edible wild plants and other foragables. He's learned about wild foods through formal academic training and over 35 years of hands-on field research. John has a doctorate in nutrition, a master's in education, and degrees in biology and zoology.
He's a trained botanist, nature photgrapher, writer, researched, and teacher. In 1993 he founded the Institute for the Study of Edible Wild Plants and Other Foragables along with its educational branch, Wild Food Adventures.
John's company is based in Portland, Oregon, where he offers regional workshops, and multi-day intensives on wild foods.

The ""family"" restaurant, redefined. Home to the finest in Napolitan' cuisine and Essex County's best kept secret. Now Artie Bucco, la cucina's master chef and your personal host, invites you to a special feast...with a little help from his friends. From arancini to zabaglione, from baccala to Quail Sinatra-style, Artie Bucco and his guests, the Sopranos and their associates, offer food lovers one hundred Avellinese-style recipes and valuable preparation tips. But that's not all! Artie also brings you a cornucopia of precious Sopranos artifacts that includes photos from the old country; the first Bucco's Vesuvio's menu from 1926; AJ's school essay on ""Why I Like Food""; Bobby Bacala's style tips for big eaters, and much, much more.

Enjoy his tender Grilled Sausages sizzling with fennel or cheese. Warning: Piercing the skin is a fire hazard. Corrado ""Junior"" Soprano, Tony's uncle ""Mama always cooked. No one died of too much cholesterol or some such crap."" Savor his Pasta Fazool, a toothsome marriage of cannellini beans and ditalini pasta, or Giambott', a grand-operatic vegetable medley.

Sink your teeth into his Eggs in Purgatory-eight eggs, bubbling tomato sauce, and an experience that's pure heaven. As Artie says, ""Enjoy, with a thousand meals and a thousand laughs. Buon' appetito!""",14280,"From Publishers Weekly
In what is quite possibly the most fun of all the Sopranos-themed titles being published in time for the show's September return, this tongue-in-cheek cookbook brings homestyle Soprano family cooking to the table. Artie Bucco, the character (played by John Ventimiglia) who is the chef at the show's Vesuvio restaurant, sets the tone of this book of insider ""family"" secrets by explaining his family's move from Campania, Italy, to New Jersey, then turns to various Soprano characters. (A brief chapter on Neapolitan cooking is explained by the Newark Public Library's Natalie del Greco, who offers recipes for a simple Marinara Sauce as well as a Sunday Gravy.) In a chapter entitled ""The Soprano Family Tradition,"" Bucco listens as Corrado Soprano Jr., or Uncle Jun', reminisces about Newark's Little Italy (which at one time felt like an ""Italian Disneyland"") while whetting his appetite with thoughts of Pasta Fagiole and Panzerotti (Neapolitan Potato Croquettes). While the book's conceit is playfully written by Rucker (The Sopranos: A Family History) in the voice of each character, the recipes, by Scicolone (Italian Holiday Cooking), are solid and honest-to-goodness Italian-American dishes. In a conversation with Bucco, Carmela Soprano reveals her Sicilian upbringing through such recipes as `Shcarole and Garlic (sauteed escarole), while scale-tipping Bobby Bacala pontificates on the importance of sweets and offers his own way to make Cannoli. Even the godfather himself, Tony Soprano, lectures on the art of the grill (fans will remember his BBQ panic attack). In the end, readers are left with a book-filled with stills from Soprano episodes-that is alternately enticing and wonderfully tacky, just like the Soprano family members themselves.

Cod, Mark Kurlansky’s third work of nonfiction and winner of the 1999 James Beard Award, is the biography of a single species of fish, but it may as well be a world history with this humble fish as its recurring main character. Cod, it turns out, is the reason Europeans set sail across the Atlantic, and it is the only reason they could. What did the Vikings eat in icy Greenland and on the five expeditions to America recorded in the Icelandic sagas? Cod, frozen and dried in the frosty air, then broken into pieces and eaten like hardtack. What was the staple of the medieval diet? Cod again, sold salted by the Basques, an enigmatic people with a mysterious, unlimited supply of cod. As we make our way through the centuries of cod history, we also find a delicious legacy of recipes, and the tragic story of environmental failure, of depleted fishing stocks where once their numbers were legendary. In this lovely, thoughtful history, Mark Kurlansky ponders the question: Is the fish that changed the world forever changed by the world's folly?

“Every once in a while a writer of particular skill takes a fresh, seemingly improbable idea and turns out a book of pure delight. Such is the case of Mark Kurlansky and the codfish.” –David McCullough, author of The Wright Brothers and 1776",22063,"Review
“A charming fish tale and a pretty gift for your favorite seafood cook or fishing monomaniac. But in the last analysis, it’s a bitter ecological fable for our time.” –Los Angeles Times

“Every once in a while a writer of particular skill takes a fresh, seemingly improbable idea and turns out a book of pure delight. Such is the case of Mark Kurlansky and the codfish.” –David McCullough, author of 1776, John Adams, and The Wright Brothers

“One of the 25 Best Books of the Year.” –The New York Public Library

""A subject as mighty and tragic as this deserves an excellent biographer, and in Mark Kurlansky, cod has found one. Beautifully written and elegantly illustrated . . . Kurlansky's marvelous fish opus stands as a reminder of what good non-fiction used to be: eloquent, learned, and full of earthy narratives that delight and appall."" -The Globe and Mail

""In the end the book stands as a kind of elegy, a loving eulogy not only to a fish, but to the people whose lives have been shaped by the habits of the fish, and whose way of life is now at an end."" -Newsday

""What a prodigious creature is the cod. Kurlansky's approach is intriguing - and deceptively whimsical. This little book is a work of no small consequence."" -Business Week 

""In the story of the cod, Mark Kurlansky has found the tragic fable of our age - abundance turned to scarcity through determined shortsightedness. This classic history will stand as an epitaph and a warning."" -Bill McKibben

In Barefoot Contessa How Easy Is That? Ina proves once again that it doesn’t take complicated techniques, special equipment, or stops at more than one grocery store to make wonderful dishes for your family and friends. Her newest must-have cookbook is all about saving time and avoiding stress while having fun in the kitchen.

These are not recipes with three ingredients thrown together in five minutes; instead home cooks will find fantastic Barefoot Contessa recipes that are easy to make but still have all that deep, delicious flavor Ina is known for—and that makes a meal so satisfying. Think Pink Grapefruit Margaritas served with Smoked Salmon Deviled Eggs—two classics with a twist. For lunch, Ina makes everyone’s favorite Ultimate Grilled Cheese sandwich and Snap Peas with Pancetta. For dinner, try Jeffrey’s Roast Chicken (tried and true!); Steakhouse Steaks, which come out perfectly every time and—with Ina’s easy tip—couldn’t be simpler; or an Easy Parmesan “Risotto” that you throw in the oven instead of stirring endlessly on the stovetop. Finally, Ina’s desserts never disappoint—from Red Velvet Cupcakes to Chocolate Pudding Cream Tart.

To top it all off, Ina also shares her best tips for making cooking really easy. She leaves bowls of lemons and limes on the counter not only because they look great but because they also remind her that a squeeze of lemon in a dish brightens the flavors. She shows us the equipment that makes a difference to her—like sharp knives, the right zester, an extra bowl for her electric mixer—and that can help you in your kitchen, too.

From Publishers Weekly
The focus is on creating simpler yet appetizing dishes that save time and minimize stress in the kitchen in bestselling author (Barefoot Contessa Cookbook) and Food Network guru Garten's latest. She showcases recipes that utilize fewer ingredients, limited to those easily found in supermarkets or specialty food stores. She also stays away from time-consuming cooking techniques, instead making unusually good use of her oven for everything from easy parmesan risotto and French toast bread pudding to spicy turkey meatballs. Despite the relative simplicity of these dishes, they are still elegant enough to be served at dinner parties, especially the roasted figs and prosciutto, fresh salmon tartare, and the mouthwatering, easy Provençal lamb. Garten's vegetable dishes are particularly appealing and varied, including scalloped tomatoes, garlic-roasted cauliflower, and potato basil purée, and her desserts are equally strong, with easy cranberry and apple cake and fleur de sel caramels. Full-color photos accompany each recipe and are enough to send any hungry soul immediately into the kitchen. True to her trademark style, Garten once again shows that delicious food can be prepared with a minimum of fuss, even with guests on the way.

NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER

If you're eating healthy, but just can't seem to lose weight, you're not alone. Sugar is the single biggest needle mover when it comes to your health and the number on the scale, but sugar hides in places you'd never expect: whole foods, diet foods, packaged foods, dressings . . . even sugar substitutes. And it's not enough to cut out or cut back on sugar-you have to cut out the right kinds of sugar.

In this groundbreaking book, New York Times bestselling author JJ Virgin explains the powerful concept of Sugar Impact: how different sugars react differently in the body. High Sugar Impact foods cause weight gain, energy crashes, and inflammation. Low Sugar Impact foods fuel your body for prolonged energy and promote fat burning. This eye-opening book pinpoints the most damaging sugars that we eat every day-without even realizing it-in common foods like skim milk, diet soda, whole-grain bread, and ""healthy"" sweeteners like agave.

By swapping High Sugar Impact foods for Low Sugar Impact foods, you will shed fat fast--up to 10 pounds in 2 weeks!--and transform your body and your health for good. Best of all, you don't need to eliminate sugar completely or count calories. Prepare to:
Lose the bloat
Target belly fat
Rev your metabolism
Cut cravings
Become a fat burner, not a sugar burner
Lose fat fast-and forever!",60207,"Review

From the Back Cover
It's not about willpower--it's about your body chemistry
You've tried dieting, and, after some initial success, you always seem to put the weight back on. Stop blaming yourself! The problem isn't with you; it's with the diets themselves.
Many are based on the glycemic index, which doesn't make a distinction between good carbohydrates, such as carrots, from bad ones like starches--potatoes, white pasta, sugar, etc. Nor do they take into account real-life serving sizes; the GI numbers are based on lab-controlled portions. The good news is that nutritional scientists have developed the glycemic load, a powerful new tool for controlling weight that's based on what people actually eat and allows for more of a variety of foods.
In The Glycemic-Load Diet, cardiologist Dr. Rob Thompson unveils a revolutionary eating and exercise plan that helps you reverse insulin resistance, allowing you to:
Eat more of the foods you like
Eliminate cravings for starchy foods
Eat chocolate and still lose weight!
Speed up your metabolism with regular, non-strenuous exercise

This edition is a more user-friendly edition of the award-winning and critically acclaimed cookbook series which began in 1986. Food of Life provides 330 classical and regional Iranian recipes as well as an introduction to Persian art, history, and culture. The book's hundreds of full color photographs are intertwined with descriptions of ancient and modern Persian ceremonies, poetry, folktales, travelogue excerpts and anecdotes. The 2011 Edition of Food of Life is a labor of love. The book began in exile after the Iranian Revolution of 1979 as a love letter to Batmanglij's children.

Food of Life propels Persian cooking into the 21st Century, even as it honors venerable traditions and centuries of artistic expression.

Readers learn how to simply yet deliciously cook rice, the jewel of Persian cooking, which, when combined with a little meat, fowl, or fish, vegetables, fruits, and herbs, provides the perfect balanced diet.
ABOUT THE BOOK'S TITLE

From the Inside Flap
Cooking plays important roles in every culture, but Persian cuisine can claim a relationship to its native land that is uniquely deep and intricate. This book celebrates the central place of food in the life of Iran, a story extending back almost 4,000 years, when recipes were first recorded in a cuneiform script on clay tablets. At the same time, Food of Life--updated and expanded in this new edition--is designed to be used by today's cook. It provides a veritable treasury of recipes: 330 in all, presented in an easy to-follow format, along with standard variations and, in many cases, a vegetarian version. The title of the book comes from the words nush-e jan, literally ""food of life""--a traditional wish in Iran that a dish will be enjoyed.
Along with daily gifts of pleasure, Persian cooking has figured intimately in numerous Iranian festivals and ceremonies. The menus and recipes associated with such events are described in Food of Life in detail, from the winter solstice celebration, Shab-e Yalda, or the ""sun's birthday eve,"" to the rituals and symbolism involved in a modern Iranian marriage. Also woven through this book are many examples of how food has inspired artists, poets, and other luminaries of Persian culture. The book includes the miniatures of Mir Mosavvar and Aqa Mirak; excerpts from such classics as the fourth-century tale Khosrow and His Knight, the tenth-century Book of Kings, and the Thousand and One Nights; poems by Omar Khayyam, Rumi, and Sohrab Sepehri; and the humor of Mulla Nasruddin.
Even as it honors venerable traditions and centuries of artistic expression, Food of Life propels Persian cooking into the twenty-first century. Today, with most of the ingredients in this book's recipes readily available throughout the U.S., anyone can reproduce the refined tastes, textures, and beauty of this great cuisine-- ancient, and also timeless.

From the Author
A Kid From LA

I grew up in the great city of Los Angeles, which is a perfect melting pot! Within a 10-mile radius, there was Thai
Town, Koreatown, Little Tokyo, Boyle Heights, a Central American hood and little Phillipinotown. That meant I grew
up eating these ethnic cuisines daily and had access to legendary institutions like Spago, Michael's and Border
Grill. LA has such a unique culinary landscape and it's a city I love to the marrow.
 
My Chinese grandparents moved to Thailand, where my parents were born, and then my parents came to LA in
1966. My grandmother was my first culinary teacher. I sat on the counter and watched her make dinner every
night. As I got older, we'd take the bus to LA's Chinatown, eat dim sum, buy groceries for the day, then come home
and cook. I saw thousands of dinners cooked in front of me and, eventually, I was able to help.
 
I worked at my family's restaurants and markets. I got to see food in 360˚, from farm to market, market to
restaurant, then cook to table. I had such a unique culinary upbringing, and that was just my first 15 years. Then
the following years brought me to French culinary school, Japanese cooking school and then to working at some
great restaurants in LA. I took my time working through many cooking schools as a culinary educator. After that, I
did a stint in corporate dining, which brought me to one of the best hotel casinos in America. All that was before

To many of us, ""diet"" is a four-letter word. And rightfully so. Starving yourself thin or keeping track of each bite like pennies in your checkbook is no way to live. So what's a girl with skinny jean dreams supposed to do?

Teresa Giudice has the answer. In fact, she was born with it. The first-generation Italian-American mom of four and svelte star of The Real Housewives of New Jersey credits her knockout figure to her Old World upbringing. And now, in her fun, encouraging, and budget-friendly cookbook, she skewers the myth that looking fabulous has to be a chore.

In Skinny Italian, she reveals how to: substitute tedious meal plans with simple, flavorful recipes; choose fresh, flavorful ingredients instead of counting calories; slow down and enjoy a faster metabolism; replace starvation with celebration by adopting an Italian attitude to cooking, eating, and entertaining; love food, love eating, and still love your body afterward!

Teresa shows how anyone can master the cornerstones of Italian cuisine. Learn how to make six different tomato sauces from scratch, how to choose and use the right olive oil, and how to prepare over sixty Giudice family recipes straight from Salerno. From Gorgeous Garlic Shrimp to Beautiful Biscotti, you'll want to make these sumptuous recipes again and again. Discover how easy and economical wholesome, homemade cooking can be.

Skinny Italian is not a diet book. It's an ""eat it and enjoy it"" book. Join Teresa and discover how gorgeous can be a sumptuous side effect to living la bella vita.",121630,"From Publishers Weekly
Giudice, famous for table flipping and gushing over her juicy husband, Joe, on Bravo's Real Housewives of New Jersey, offers a simple rundown of Italian standards like pesto and puttanesca sauces, veal piccata, steak pizzaiola, almond biscotti and the classic bellini in her authentic yet dishy look into food and family. Few recipes will surprise the seasoned Italian cook, though Giudice gets points for keeping dishes rather healthy while boosting flavor with fresh herbs, pungent garlic, and hot pepper. Coupled with family photos and sidebar comments about their friends and favorite dishes from Teresa and Joe, the book plays well to a younger, hipper home cook. With a focus on steering clear of reputation-ruining no-nos like jarred sauce and rinsing cooked pasta, Giudice dives into some deeper waters with coaching on making pizza dough and canning tomatoes. Though she tries a little too hard to make everything salacious, gorgeous, and fabulous, useful tips abound (the section on olive oil is titled OO, VOO, EVOO, WTF?). Take away the overblown catch phrases and effusive references to her mama, The Sopranos, and the motherland, and you're left with a solid mid-week Italian cookbook. Then again, perhaps it's the chatty Teresa and her feisty yet playful anecdotes that make this an irresistible, guilty pleasure. (May)

The stir-fry is all things: refined, improvisational, adaptable, and inventive. It is the rare culinary practice that makes less seem like more, and by which small amounts of food feed many.
For centuries the Chinese have carried their woks to all corners of the earth and re-created stir-fry dishes, using local and sometimes nontraditional ingredients. The old expression: ""One wok runs to the sky’s edge"" means ""one who uses the wok becomes master of the cooking world."" And as the wok user becomes master of the cooking world, so does he become master of the stir-fry, one of the greatest techniques of Chinese cookery.
The technique and tradition of stir-frying, which is at once simple yet subtly complex, is as vital today as it has been for hundreds of years. In Stir-Frying to the Sky’s Edge, James Beard Award-winning author Grace Young shares more than 100 classic stir-fry recipes that sizzle with heat and pop with flavor, from the great Cantonese stir-fry masters to the culinary customs of Sichuan, Hunan, Shanghai, Beijing, Fujian, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia, as well as other countries around the world. With more than 80 stunning full-color photographs, Young’s definitive work illustrates the innumerable, easy-to-learn possibilities the technique offers—dry stir-fries, moist stir-fries, clear stir-fries, velvet stir-fries—and weaves the insights of Chinese cooking philosophy into the preparation of such beloved dishes as Kung Pao Chicken, Stir-Fried Beef and Broccoli, Chicken Lo Mein with Ginger Mushrooms, and Dry-Fried Sichuan Beans. In honoring the traditions of her cultural ancestors who traveled the globe, Young offers delectable crossover recipes for Chinese Jamaican Jerk Chicken Fried Rice, Chinese Trinidadian Stir-Fried Shrimp with Rum, Chinese Burmese Chili Chicken, and Chinese American Shrimp with Lobster Sauce.
Expert home cooks and professional chefs teach you the foundations of stir-fry mastery in the modern kitchen—everything from how to choose, season, and care for a wok and the best skillet alternative; the importance of marinades and the proper technique for slicing meat and poultry for optimum tenderness; to how to select and handle Asian vegetables; ways to shortcut labor-intensive preparations; and tips on how to control heat and choose the best cooking oil.
Fascinating personal portraits illustrate how stir-frying is not just a cooking technique but a vital element of China’s rich culture. With this book, Grace Young has created the authoritative guide to stir-frying, a work that is at once rewarding and beautiful, much like the technique of stir-frying itself.",18102,"From Publishers Weekly
Stir-frying may have been pedestrianized by generations of vegetarian college students, but this beautiful, comprehensive cookbook restores it to its rightful place among the most elegant cookery techniques. The virtues of stir-frying, Young writes, are many: it makes bounty out of small amounts of meat and oil; it emphasizes healthful vegetables; and most importantly, it creates 'alchemic flavor out of raw ingredients. Young (The Breath of a Wok), has a scholarly yet impassioned approach, and she fuses personal anecdotes, meticulously researched history, and stir-fry–related arcana to illuminate her subject. She covers types of woks and utensils and a recommended stir-fry pantry, including a photograph of sauces with tricky-to-decipher packaging. At the book's heart are the classic techniques and dishes of China's regional cuisines, such as Hunan-style cumin beef, Cantonese chicken with black bean sauce, and stir-fried Sichuan beans. Still, for Young, who always travels with her own wok, the story of stir-frying is also the story of the Chinese diaspora. By tracing the stir-fry around the world, she demonstrates all of the diversity it can contain: Jamaican stir-fried chicken with chayote, Cuban fried rice, and Peruvian stir-fried filet mignon. For the serious home cook, this informative, lyrical tome is an inspiration. Photos. (May)

From Booklist
Most people associate stir-frying solely with Chinese cookery, but this classic method of flash cooking has influenced cuisines throughout the world due in large part to the Chinese diaspora. Young, whose expertise in wok technique has already enlightened American cooks, has now gathered recipes for stir-frying reflecting culinary traditions as far-flung as Indonesia and Peru. Familiar Chinese dishes such as Sichuan Pork with Peppers and Peanuts and Shrimp in Lobster Sauce honor classic flavor combinations, but Jamaican Chicken with Chayote shows that stir-frying can adapt to other cultural impulses. For the novice, Young offers lots of basic yet learned advice on shopping for unfamiliar ingredients and on assembling a Chinese pantry. Photographs and step-by-step instructions make fundamental wok tools and techniques accessible to even the least experienced. Her sidebars featuring talented stir-frying masters from all over the world add human dimension to the recipes. --Mark Knoblauch

Health journalist Vaccariello (The Digest Diet) presents a three-week program designed to resolve symptoms of five common digestive disorders and the belly bulge that accompanies them. The same diet that alleviates gastro-intestinal problems like heartburn and acid reflux, gas and bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome also results in a flat stomach. Exploring the connection between digestion and weight, explaining the role of gut bacteria, and identifying diet as the major cause behind the chronic inflammation, she advises how to “die[t] away digestive disorders.” A 3-phase, day-by-day food plan, featuring over 50 recipes, shows readers how to calm their sensitive stomachs, enjoy delicious dining, flatten those tummies, and lose an average of 6–10 lbs. With lively writing, inviting four-color format, pull-outs, sidebars, nine personal success stories (including the author’s), and enticing photography, this book is a winner.

What makes one box of cereal better for you than another, and how are we supposed to decipher the extensive lists of mysterious ingredients on every package, and then determine whether they are safe or toxic to your family's health? With nearly 40,000 items populating the average supermarket today, the Rich Food Poor Food - Grocery Purchasing System (GPS), is a unique guide that steers the consumer through the grocery store aisles, directing them to health enhancing Rich Food options while avoiding health detracting Poor Food ones.

Rich Food, Poor Food is unique in the grocery store guide arena in that rather than rating a particular food using calories, sodium, or fat as the main criteria, it identifies the products that contain wholesome, micronutrient-rich ingredients that health-conscious shoppers are looking for, like wild caught fish, grass-fed beef, raw/organic cheese, organic meats, pastured eggs and dairy, organic produce and sprouted grains, nuts and seeds, while avoiding over 150 common unwanted Poor Food ingredients such as sugar, high fructose corn syrup, refined flour, GMOs, MSG, artificial colors, flavors and sweeteners, pesticides, nitrites/ nitrates, gluten, and chemical preservatives like BHA and BHT.

So while other food swapping grocery guides may give the green light to eating Kellogg's Fruit Loops with Sprinkles, Oscar Mayer Turkey Bologna and Hostess Twinkies based on their lower calories, sodium, and/or fat levels, you won't find these heavily processed, food-like products identified as Rich Food choices in Rich Food, Poor Food. That doesn't mean this guide to micronutrient-sufficient living leads readers to a boring culinary lifestyle. Quite the contrary! The Caltons offer Rich Food choices in every aisle of the store including desserts, snacks, sauces, hot dogs, and other fun foods!

This indispensable grocery store guide raises the bar on food quality as it takes readers on an aisle-by-aisle tour, teaching them how to identify potentially problematic ingredients, while sharing tips on how to lock in a food's nutritional value during preservation and preparation, save money, and make homemade versions of favorite grocery store staples. Regardless of age, dietary preference or current health, Rich Food, Poor Food turns the grocery store and farmer's market into a micronutrient pharmacy--filling the shopping cart with a natural prescription for better health and longevity.",62087,"From the Author

Each recipe, complete with nutritional information, was crafted to become a well-loved staple in your repertoire with a focus not only on healthy eating, but also on easy cooking. Diet customization options, veggie swap suggestions, and special attention paid to one-pot, make-ahead, and no-cook meals ensure that Inspiralize Everything will become a workhorse in your kitchen. Want a vegan dinner that’s minimal on cleanup? Try Cheeseless French Onion Soup. How about a hearty meal that’ll make great leftovers for lunch tomorrow? Winter Lasagna with Butternut Squash, Brussels Sprouts, and Chicken Sausage is for you. Need a super detox to reset your tastebuds? The Watermelon Radish Nourish Salad with Lemon-Ginger Vinaigrette is just the thing. Sweet tooth satisfaction? Proceed straight to the Zucchini Noodle Bread with Coconut Cream Frosting. 

Whether you have weight-loss goals, follow a specific healthy lifestyle, or just want to make good-for-you food at home, this book has the answer. If you’re a spiralizing pro, this book will become your recipe bible; if you’re just starting out, it will teach you everything you need to know.

Growing up in a Chinese household in Malaysia where cuisine and culture were inseparable, Bee Yinn Low developed a deep love and appreciation for food. Her early memories of helping her mother prepare steamy and fragrant Chinese meals solidified into a way of life for Bee as a working woman in Southern California. A love of Chinese food didn't translate well to a modern Western lifestyle due to time and ingredient constraints.

Rather than give up her favorite foods, Bee experimented with recreating the unforgettable flavors of her youth with her limited time and using ingredients found in local supermarkets. She managed to develop versions of her favorite Chinese dishes that had all the taste—but were a lot less work!

In Easy Chinese Recipes, Bee shares her passion and expertise in Chinese cooking. It features a collection of Bee's all-time favorite dishes—the foods she loves to cook and eat at home. She includes updated traditional family recipes along with her own versions of the best Chinese restaurant dishes from around Asia.

""Plumb Bee's debut cookbook and you'll find interesting nuggets of information that she's plucked from Asian kitchens.

She maintains a lifestyle free of toxic chemicals and is passionate about creating delicious and hearty food from real ingredients. She wants her food to be true, as close to its natural state as possible.

Her recipes—flax banana quinoa muffins, bison and veggie kabobs, and even zucchini almond butter blondies—are proof that a healthy lifestyle isn’t boring or bland. Feed yourself real food and see how much better you feel, both mentally and physically.",6089,"Review

Keto Quick Start targets everyday real-world concerns such as what to expect in the first few weeks and how to know if you’re on the right track, how to determine if you need more carbs and how to incorporate those carbs in a healthy way, how to customize keto for your personal goals (especially weight loss), and things to be aware of if you’re concerned about a particular health issue.

Keto Quick Start includes 100 delicious keto recipes, four weekly meal plans, more than a dozen easy meal ideas (no recipe required!), and troubleshooting tips and tricks. It also features a unique and easy-to-use template that makes tracking your food quick and simple. The recipes include:

How lucky we are that [Ruth Reichl] had the courage to follow her appetite.”—Newsday

At an early age, Ruth Reichl discovered that “food could be a way of making sense of the world. If you watched people as they ate, you could find out who they were.” Her deliciously crafted memoir Tender at the Bone is the story of a life defined, determined, and enhanced in equal measure by a passion for food, by unforgettable people, and by the love of tales well told. Beginning with her mother, the notorious food-poisoner known as the Queen of Mold, Reichl introduces us to the fascinating characters who shaped her world and tastes, from the gourmand Monsieur du Croix, who served Reichl her first foie gras, to those at her politically correct table in Berkeley who championed the organic food revolution in the 1970s. Spiced with Reichl’s infectious humor and sprinkled with her favorite recipes, Tender at the Bone is a witty and compelling chronicle of a culinary sensualist’s coming-of-age. 

Featuring a special Afterword by the author and more than a dozen personal family photos

If you find cooking scary or stressful or just boring, Jessica has a calm, confidencebuilding approach to cooking, even for those who’ve never followed a recipe or used an oven. Jessica shows you how to prepare deliciously simple food—from Caesar salad, rice pilaf, and roasted asparagus to lemon salmon, roast chicken, and flourless fudge cake. At the beginning of each dish, she explains up front what the challenge will be, and then shows you exactly how to overcome any hurdles in easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions.

Urged by his doctor to keep his sodium intake ""under 1,500-2000 mg. a day,"" Don headed for the kitchen and went to work. Aware that cutting out table salt is the barest beginning of a true low-sodium diet, Don devised recipes for delicious low-sodium dishes that added up to less than 500 mg. daily, 70% lower than those in other low-sodium cookbooks.

* Hundreds of good tasting, easy-to-make recipes

A congestive heart failure survivor becomes a no-salt cooking guru and proves you don't have to sacrifice flavor to cut salt. He shares his journey to better health and his favorite low-sodium recipes.  -- Marsha McCulloch, M.S., R.D., Meredith Publications, Heart Healthy Magazine, Spring, 2009.

Even though it's a cookbook, this work reads like high drama: Gazzaniga suffered from heart failure, a condition that can in some cases necessitate a heart transplant; but because he successfully controlled his salt and sodium intake, he has restored his health.  - Publishers Weekly (Jan.12)

From the Author
It is Thanksgiving week, 2011. I have lived fifteen years longer than I was first diagnosed to live in January of 1997. In that time I have met thirteen new grandchildren and learned to do things I always wanted to do, like oil painting, playing a saxophone, cruising around in my own bass boat and generally enjoying life. I have reversed my heart disease. From a close-encounter with a transplant to my activities today is rather amazing.  I credit four things for this.

1. Consuming no salt. Absolutely no salt. Sodium levels at or below 500 mg per day. 
2. Heart medications including Carvidilol, Cozaar and digitalis. 
3. Exercise daily.
4. Do something new every day or at least try to learn something new. In other words, keep the brain active as well as the body.


The recipes I have created over the past fifteen years have helped others as well. Please read the testimonials at megaheart.com for confirmation. They are each unsolicited and each is there with the permission of those who sent them to me at their own volition.


This cookbook and the other books in this series will help you recover. And you will note many testimonials come from those with Meniere's Syndrome, hypertension, diabetes and other maladies. When I first wrote this book I thought only of heart disease. I have learned since that a multitude of diseases are helped with a no-salt, low-sodium lifestyle.

But sometimes, we could really go for Chili Pie, Benedict Deviled Eggs, Thin Mint Cookies, and Apple Pie. Even the most disciplined and willful among us can become bored and wayward on a routine of bland, repetitive meals. Humans naturally crave delicious food, interesting cuisine and variety.
 Primal Cravings sets out to provide the best of both worlds – the food to satiate our deep seated, visceral urges made with ingredients that satisfy our ancient, genetic needs for good health. This cookbook contains 125 Primal/Paleo recipes, and also includes bonus features that detail the authors’ thoughts of the tenets of a Primal/Paleo diet and the mentality of a flexible, healthy eating lifestyle to show you how vibrant health can be found without sacrificing great taste.
 Based in South Carolina, authors Brandon and Megan Keatley created Primal Cravings on the momentum of their popular Health-Bent.com website – a treasure trove of Primal/Paleo recipes, workout tips and motivational messages. These kitchen whizzes and expert-level fitness coaches present PrimalCravings after several years of research, experimentation and perfecting recipes in their home kitchen. Primal Cravings presents the recipes in a simple, clear, easy-to-navigate format, and offers a detailed macronutrient analysis of each preparation. Knowing time is the most valuable resource, they also provide primers on ingredients, tools, and stocking your kitchen, and offer menu suggestions for a variety of occasions and considerations (quick, budget, feeding a crowd).
 With PrimalCravings, you can enjoy assorted breakfasts, meat and main dishes, sides and salads, snacks, sweets and basics like bread, sauces, and dressings that adhere to Primal/Paleo guidelines. Inside you’ll find 100% low-sugar, grain-free, gluten-free, industrial oil-free recipes all accompanied by full color photos. Pioneering new gluten/grain free baking techniques for Primal Cravings, the Keatleys show you how to make the best Primal treats you’ve ever had. If you’ve been missing or looking for healthy, innovative ways to make things from All-American fare like breakfast egg dishes, waffles and pancakes, muffins, burgers, chili, pizza, chips, baked goods (cakes, pies, cookies, crackers, brownies) and frozen desserts to global cuisine like gyros, spanakopita, moo shu, barbacoa, tacos, tikka masala and other favorites – then this is the book for you.",214030,"From the Author

It all started one day when Momofuku founder David Chang asked Christina to make a dessert for dinner that night. Just like that, the pastry program at Momofuku began.

Christina’s playful desserts, including the compost cookie, a chunky chocolate-chip cookie studded with crunchy salty pretzels and coffee grounds; the crack pie, a sugary-buttery confection as craveable as the name implies; the cereal milk ice cream, made from everyone’s favorite part of a nutritious breakfast—the milk at the bottom of a bowl of cereal; and the easy layer cakes that forgo fancy frosting in favor of unfinished edges that hint at the yumminess inside helped the restaurants earn praise from the New York Times and the Michelin Guide and led to the opening of Milk Bar, which now draws fans from around the country and the world.

With all the recipes for the bakery’s most beloved desserts—along with ones for savory baked goods that take a page from Chang’s Asian-flavored cuisine, such as Kimchi Croissants with Blue Cheese—and 100 color photographs, Momofuku Milk Bar makes baking irresistible off-beat treats at home both foolproof and fun.",,,,"['milk bar', 'crack pie', 'christina tosi', 'ice cream', 'chocolate chip', 'birthday cake', 'cereal milk', 'momofuku milk', 'pastry chef', 'compost cookies', 'new york', 'freeze dried', 'stand mixer', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Genius recipes surprise us and make us rethink the way we cook. They might involve an unexpectedly simple technique, debunk a kitchen myth, or apply a familiar ingredient in a new way. They’re handed down by luminaries of the food world and become their legacies. And, once we’ve folded them into our repertoires, they make us feel pretty genius too. In this collection are 100 of the smartest and most remarkable ones.
 
There isn’t yet a single cookbook where you can find Marcella Hazan’s Tomato Sauce with Onion and Butter, Jim Lahey’s No-Knead Bread, and Nigella Lawson’s Dense Chocolate Loaf Cake—plus dozens more of the most talked about, just-crazy-enough-to-work recipes of our time. Until now.
 
These are what Food52 Executive Editor Kristen Miglore calls genius recipes. Passed down from the cookbook authors, chefs, and bloggers who made them legendary, these foolproof recipes rethink cooking tropes, solve problems, get us talking, and make cooking more fun. Every week, Kristen features one such recipe and explains just what’s so brilliant about it in the James Beard Award-nominated Genius Recipes column on Food52. Here, in this book, she compiles 100 of the most essential ones—nearly half of which have never been featured in the column—with tips, riffs, mini-recipes, and stunning photographs from James Ransom, to create a cooking canon that will stand the test of time.
 
Once you try Michael Ruhlman’s fried chicken or Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi’s hummus, you’ll never want to go back to other versions. But there’s also a surprising ginger juice you didn’t realize you were missing and will want to put on everything—and a way to cook white chocolate that (finally) exposes its hidden glory. Some of these recipes you’ll follow to a T, but others will be jumping-off points for you to experiment with and make your own. Either way, with Kristen at the helm, revealing and explaining the genius of each recipe, Genius Recipes is destined to become every home cook’s go-to resource for smart, memorable cooking—because no one cook could have taught us so much.",18982,"Review

More than 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, according to an Institute of Medicine report released in 2011. For many, chronic pain is part of an autoimmune disease, but all too often doctors turn to the same solution: painkilling drugs.

But all of this medication simply isn’t helping, and as Dr. Peter Osborne, the leading authority on gluten sensitivity and food allergies has found, the real solution often lies in what you eat. In No Grain, No Pain, Dr. Osborne shows how grains wreak havoc on the body by causing tissue inflammation, creating vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and triggering an autoimmune response that causes the body to attack itself. But he also offers practical steps to find relief. Using his drug-free, easy-to-implement plan, you will be able to eliminate all sources of gluten and gluten-like substances, experience significant improvement in fifteen days, and eliminate pain within thirty days.

The first book to identify diet—specifically, grain—as a leading cause of chronic suffering, No Grain, No Pain provides you with the knowledge you need to improve your health. Based on extensive research and examples culled from thousands of his satisfied patients, Dr. Osborne recommends changing your diet to achieve the relief that millions of Americans have been seeking once and for all, leading to a healthier, happier life.",17575,"Review
“In NO GRAIN, NO PAIN, Dr. Peter Osborne destroys prevalent gluten-free myths, showing the widespread damage grains create and providing an easy-to-use, powerfully effective program that helps you become lean, healthy, energetic, and pain-free. This book's a must-read!” -- JJ Virgin, New York Times bestselling author of The Virgin Diet and The Sugar Impact Diet

“If there is one thing I appreciate from the smart people I'm privileged to call friends, it's when they put their knowledge out there for the rest of the world to read. Peter has done just that with this brilliant book. Well-researched and well written, this book is a must read!” -- Leanne Ely, CNC, New York Times bestselling author of Body Clutter and founder of SavingDinner.com

""A must-read book for anyone suffering with chronic pain. Dr. Osborne transforms the way we need to look at not just gluten, but most grains and their impact on autoimmune disease and inflammation."" -- Sara Gottfried, M.D., New York Times best selling author of The Hormone Cure and The Hormone Reset Diet

""There are a few people I turn to when I need sound health advice. Peter Osborne is one of them. He's one of the smartest natural practitioners and easily one of the world's leading authorities on going gluten free. This book is far overdue and brings together Peter's immense knowledge and years of experience helping hundreds of pain suffers regain a happier, pain-free life."" -- Yuri Elkaim, New York Times bestselling author of The All-Day Energy Diet

“Dr. Osborne offers many exciting new insights, in plain language, into the dynamics of celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and how our immune systems react, and overreact, to large families of food proteins. This important book provides clear and unique instructions for following the path back to pain-free wellness. It also clarifies a variety of processes such as ‘gluten-free whiplash’ for those who have tried avoiding gluten with either transient or no success, along with a host of dietary insights into these widespread maladies. Dr. Osborne also delves into the dynamics of sugar-driven illnesses and gluten-driven obesity. There are few individuals in the industrialized world that would not benefit from reading this book.” -- Ron Hoggan, Ed. D., coauthor of Dangerous Grains

""We have a new normal and it, unfortunately, includes chronic suffering that falls through the cracks of conventional medical attention. Pain, in its many manifestations is an arena where prescription treatment can generate further complexity and leave patients with issues of incomplete relief, side effects, and dependency. Here we have an elegant solution that can offer, not only real time results around pain, but also the potential for full body transformation. Dr. Osborne provides the history, the why's, and the how's to take back your health, one meal at a time."" -- Kelly Brogan, MD

This book is the much needed evolution of the conversation about gluten. Dr. Osborne takes the topic to a whole new level of understanding and sheds light on the fact that gluten is not the only enemy within grain that is capable of causing pain and disease. Dr. Osborne also creates a brand-new awareness about pain being from hidden internal chemical causes as well as the obvious structural causes. Any one of the millions of people with unexplained pain can benefit from this material. -- Alan Christianson, NMD, New York Times bestselling author of The Adrenal Reset Diet and founder of Integrative Health

""Dr. Peter Osborne brings hope and healing to people with pain in his new book by looking for the underlying root causes of pain disorders. This book will give you the information you need to become pain free without the use of habit forming medications! If you are currently suffering with pain, please read Dr.Osborne's book- it may just save your life."" -- Dr. Izabella Wentz

""The relationship between grain consumption and pain has never been so thoroughly analyzed as with Dr. Osborne's new book. After many years of tireless research and clinical experience, Dr. Osborne has produced an excellent resource on the theoretical motivation and practical tools needed to take back control of one's health."" -- Sayer Ji, Founder of GreenMedInfo.com

Q:--Barbara Goldberg ""Is the idea of cooking and serving on salt blocks new?""

A:--Mark Bitterman ""It's less than a decade old. Its discovery is a little shrouded in mystery. I think there was some opportunistic cooking maybe on salt stones in ages past. But in terms of salt-block cooking the way we think of it now, all evidence I have is that it's an American invention.""

(This article can be found on Reuters and Yahoo News! 07/23/14) (Barbara Goldberg, Chicago Tribune)

""The salt expert gives lessons on cooking with salt bricks, which adds a sublte saltiness and can get hot enough on a grill to sear steak."" (Food & Wine)

""If the subject of salt is intriguing to you, as it is to me, here are some books available on the subject: Mark Bittman. Salted: A Manifesto on the World's Most Essential Mineral. And also Salt Block Cooking: 70 Recipes for Grilling, Chilling, Searing and Serving on Himalayan Salt Blocks. Bittman is an expert on salt and tells the tale beautifully."" (Lou Jane Temple, Kansas City Star)

""SALT BLOCK COOKING follows up on the author's prior 2010 introduction to the concept in SALTED and provides a powerful account on how to use Himalayan salt blocks for grilling, baking, and cooking.  Some seventy recipes are used to display all the basics of using salt blocks to maximum advantage , and include everything you need to know about the process, from shopping for a block and maintaining one to healing, cooling and serving all kinds of foods.  A 'must' for any cookbook collection looking for the basics on salt block use"" (James A. Cox, Midwest Book Review)

""Good read. Salt Block Cooking by Mark Bitterman is the home cook's guide to a technique once only practiced by top chefs. Himalayan salt blocks are sold at specialty retail stores around the world, including The Spice & Tea Exchange, 309 N. Park Ave. in Winter Park.

This book is the first to address salt-block cooking and includes 70 recipes designed for this reusable cooking tool. The process involves heating the blocks and cooking meat or seafood directly on the surface. When not used for food preparation, the blocks make nifty serving platters for cold and room-temperature items.

In the picturesque village of Guzmán, Spain, in a cave dug into a hillside on the edge of town, an ancient door leads to a cramped limestone chamber known as “the telling room.” Containing nothing but a wooden table and two benches, this is where villagers have gathered for centuries to share their stories and secrets—usually accompanied by copious amounts of wine.
 
It was here, in the summer of 2000, that Michael Paterniti found himself listening to a larger-than-life Spanish cheesemaker named Ambrosio Molinos de las Heras as he spun an odd and compelling tale about a piece of cheese. An unusual piece of cheese. Made from an old family recipe, Ambrosio’s cheese was reputed to be among the finest in the world, and was said to hold mystical qualities. Eating it, some claimed, conjured long-lost memories. But then, Ambrosio said, things had gone horribly wrong. . . .

By the time the two men exited the telling room that evening, Paterniti was hooked. Soon he was fully embroiled in village life, relocating his young family to Guzmán in order to chase the truth about this cheese and explore the fairy tale–like place where the villagers conversed with farm animals, lived by an ancient Castilian code of honor, and made their wine and food by hand, from the grapes growing on a nearby hill and the flocks of sheep floating over the Meseta.

What Paterniti ultimately discovers there in the highlands of Castile is nothing like the idyllic slow-food fable he first imagined. Instead, he’s sucked into the heart of an unfolding mystery, a blood feud that includes accusations of betrayal and theft, death threats, and a murder plot. As the village begins to spill its long-held secrets, Paterniti finds himself implicated in the very story he is writing.

Equal parts mystery and memoir, travelogue and history, The Telling Room is an astonishing work of literary nonfiction by one of our most accomplished storytellers. A moving exploration of happiness, friendship, and betrayal, The Telling Room introduces us to Ambrosio Molinos de las Heras, an unforgettable real-life literary hero, while also holding a mirror up to the world, fully alive to the power of stories that define and sustain us.

Praise for The Telling Room

“Captivating . . . Paterniti’s writing sings, whether he’s talking about how food activates memory, or the joys of watching his children grow.”—NPR",253085,"Review
“Captivating . . . Paterniti’s writing sings, whether he’s talking about how food activates memory, or the joys of watching his children grow.”—NPR

“A gorgeous and impassioned monument to the art and mystery of storytelling, The Telling Room is rich, funny, humane, devastating, and beautiful. It made me want to applaud, it made me want to cry, it made me want to move to Spain. Michael Paterniti is a genius.”—Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love

“Unforgettable . . . a must-read for all who think of Spain as magical, who consider cheese as the ultimate gift of love, who love stories of betrayal, despair, revenge and redemption.”—The Wall Street Journal

“The Telling Room embodies the spirit of slow food and life.”—Michael Pollan

“Elegant, strange, funny, and insightful, The Telling Room is a marvelous tale and a joyful read, a trip into a world peopled by some of the most remarkable characters—and, yes, cheese—in memory.”—Susan Orlean, author of The Orchid Thief

“By the time you hit the tenth page of The Telling Room, you realize you’re in the hands of a storyteller so masterful, emotionally subtle, and smooth that you’re willing to follow him anywhere, even into a cave. And you will.”—The Daily Beast

“Rich and shaggy, full of Castilian-size detours . . . one hugely likable book.”—The Boston Globe

“Exquisite . . . [a] gripping tale. [Grade:] A”

“Breathtakingly cinematic . . . reads like Bill Buford’s conveying the passions of both author and subject, but with David Foster Wallace’s gift for digression.”

“Paterniti dives deeply into Spain’s political history, the pleasures of craft, and the motives and methods of storytelling itself.”

“Few writers can write about the taste of food with Paterniti’s vibrancy and precision. . . . [He] is a master of finding and telling great stories (the finding, for most writers, often being as difficult as the telling) that appear to be about something small, such as cheese, but are actually about something far larger—in this case, the whole of human existence. . . . As much as is about a Spaniard’s quest to create a cheese that embodies all the love and pain and joy he’s ever known, it’s also the story of a writer’s quest to channel that obsession into the perfect story.”

“For my money, Paterniti is one of the most expansive and joyful writers around—big-hearted and humane and funny. This book is a wild and amazing ride.”

“The list of writers I would read even if they were to write about a piece of cheese has always been short, but it includes Michael Paterniti. He has proved here that if you love something enough and pay a passionate enough attention to it, the whole world can become present in it.”

Eighty-six-year-old Betty Halbreich is a true original who could have stepped straight out of Stephen Sondheim’s repertoire.

She has helped many find their true selves through fashion, frank advice, and her own brand of wisdom.

“Lena Dunham, creator of HBO’s Girls, is now developing a series inspired by Ms. Halbreich’s life. The impatient, however, can satisfy their curiosity more immediately with I’ll Drink to That, the long-anticipated memoir in which Ms. Halbreich chronicles her life in the dressing room and beyond.” —The Wall Street Journal

“Charming… An inspirational feminist tale.” —People Magazine

“Tart, funny.” —Entertainment Weekly

“Sartorial style becomes a philosophy of life in this spirited memoir…Halbreich comes across as sage and gracious as she narrates a life full of incident, taking us inside the fashion industry and one of its great institutions.” —Publishers Weekly

“Every woman has a piece of clothing that she can’t live without, because in it, she feels most like herself. Betty’s memoir has that effect on a reader. Authentic style is a form of self-knowledge. And in that respect, I’ll Drink To That is like Betty's famous three-way mirror. She sizes up her own life fearlessly, and in the process, not only helps you to diagnose your own flaws, but to embrace your own beauty."" —Judith Thurman, author of National Book Award-winning Isak Dinesen: The Life of a Storyteller and Los Angeles Times Book Award-winning Secrets of the Flesh: A Life of Colette

 
""Betty was born to sail through people's lives telling them what to wear (and even what to do). The other day I overheard her chatting with a client, 'Oh, she's been my friend for thirty-five years, and she's only thirty.' Lines like that are good enough for George Cukor. The whole scanrio is. Maybe she's known that all these years. Fashion is not only about necessity but also a form of entertainment—and that is what Betty sells."" 

""I would trust this woman with my life—closet!"" 

""...she's the go-to celebrity. She's also the most fun."" 

""There's a pragmatic principle behind the way Betty dresses people. It's very inclusive. There's room for everyone in her process. [Betty] is able to be in the fashion world, but also take it down a peg at the same time."" 

""The fashion doctor is in....Even as designers and editors seem to be conspiring to lure women into their latest whims, Betty Halbreich is a scrupulously practical truth-teller. She considers it her job to protect women from clothes that are wrong for them. She takes pride in pushing the least expensive items she can find, when it’s appropriate...A brassy Chicago native with a manner that’s part Angela Lansbury and part Lucille Ball, Halbreich believes in taking chances with color and accessorizing lavishly."" —

Their relationship, captured so acutely in these letters, is one that has touched the hearts of thousands of readers around the world.

""A unique, throat-lumping, side-splitting treasure."" -- San Francisco Examiner",16156,"Amazon.com Review
84, Charing Cross Road is a charming record of bibliophilia, cultural difference, and imaginative sympathy. For 20 years, an outspoken New York writer and a rather more restrained London bookseller carried on an increasingly touching correspondence. In her first letter to Marks & Co., Helene Hanff encloses a wish list, but warns, ""The phrase 'antiquarian booksellers' scares me somewhat, as I equate 'antique' with expensive."" Twenty days later, on October 25, 1949, a correspondent identified only as FPD let Hanff know that works by Hazlitt and Robert Louis Stevenson would be coming under separate cover. When they arrive, Hanff is ecstatic--but unsure she'll ever conquer ""bilingual arithmetic."" By early December 1949, Hanff is suddenly worried that the six-pound ham she's sent off to augment British rations will arrive in a kosher office. But only when FPD turns out to have an actual name, Frank Doel, does the real fun begin.
Two years later, Hanff is outraged that Marks & Co. has dared to send an abridged Pepys diary. ""i enclose two limp singles, i will make do with this thing till you find me a real Pepys. THEN i will rip up this ersatz book, page by page, AND WRAP THINGS IN IT."" Nonetheless, her postscript asks whether they want fresh or powdered eggs for Christmas. Soon they're sharing news of Frank's family and Hanff's career. No doubt their letters would have continued, but in 1969, the firm's secretary informed her that Frank Doel had died. In the collection's penultimate entry, Helene Hanff urges a tourist friend, ""If you happen to pass by 84, Charing Cross Road, kiss it for me. I owe it so much.""

Chapter 1

Gear

To kick off the gear section, I’ll refer to one of my own passages from Volume 1 of The Complete Guide to Hunting, Butchering, and Cooking Wild Game: “Gear is like booze. Once you get older, you realize that quality should be regarded more highly than quantity.” That basic sentiment holds true for the small game hunter—­save your money and focus on getting yourself into a kit of quality gear rather than cutting corners by buying a bunch of subpar junk that brings you lots of frustration and not much game meat. But I’m happy to say that the hunter can equip himself or herself for a generalist approach to small game for a lot less money than it takes to get rigged up for a generalist approach to big game. The firearms, ammunition, and archery gear for small game are generally cheaper than those intended for big game, and the demands on clothing, backpacks, and cutlery are less severe. The walks tend to be shorter, the animals are smaller, and prime locations are usually a little bit closer to home.

In certain families, equipping a new small game hunter doesn’t cost a dime. When I was a kid, I hunted small game successfully for years without ever touching a new piece of gear. I wore hand-­me-­down clothes and shot hand-­me-­down guns. I longed for a brand-­spickety-­new left-­handed semi-­auto .22, yet I had to settle for an old right-­handed bolt-­action rifle that my dad had purchased from a nearby summer camp when they discontinued their marksmanship program. At the time, I was embarrassed about that rifle. But now that I’m approaching middle age, with young kids of my own, those days of making do have become a matter of personal pride to me. That old right-­handed .22, a Remington Model 581, remains one of my most treasured firearms. As it turns out, it’s a real tack driver. I intend for it to serve as my son’s first squirrel rifle.

In other words, don’t let cost get in the way of your desire to hunt small game. Resident small game licenses are dirt cheap, you usually don’t need any special tags (with the notable exception of turkey), and you can get a box of fifty .22 rounds for about five bucks. If you learn to be a deadeye with your .22, that equals ten daily bag limits of squirrels in my home state of Michigan. Or, to put it another way, ten family-­sized preparations of hasenpfeffer, a sublime and vinegary dish intended for hares that works great with fox squirrels and gray squirrels as well.

When it comes to selecting hunting gear, it’s important to pay attention to the voices of people who have been doing things longer or more successfully than you have. I leaned on the expertise of dozens of talented and dedicated hunters while putting this guidebook together. Their impressions of the gear that I discuss (or choose not to discuss) in this section have certainly colored my own opinions. But understand that my recommendations are just that: recommendations. If something here doesn’t make sense to you, or if your experiences with a certain product or idea contradict my own, then you should go with what makes you feel comfortable. 

FIREARMS

A versatile small game hunter should regard his firearms as the foundation of his hunting gear. I wouldn’t say the same for all types of hunting—­for versatile big game hunters, apparel and optics are equally as important as firearms. But for small game hunting, it’s absolutely true: guns matter, and they matter a lot.

But don’t go thinking that you need an arsenal of rifles and shotguns in order to be an effective small game hunter. If you own a vault full of shotguns, that’s great, as long as you spend enough time with one of them to learn how to use it. But for you folks who don’t have the money or inclination to accumulate a collection of firearms, don’t fret. By shopping carefully—­either used or new—­you can purchase a single shotgun that will cover virtually 95 percent of the small game hunting opportunities that this continent has to offer. If you want to bring your level of preparedness up to 100 percent, that can be easily achieved with the addition of a .22- caliber rimfire rifle.

THE SHOTGUN

The coolest thing about shotguns is how inherently versatile they are. In a given year, an enterprising hunter might use his or her shotgun to hunt everything from mourning doves weighing 5 ounces to wild turkeys topping out at 25 pounds. If that same shotgun accepts multiple types of barrels—­and many do—­it might also be used very effectively for whitetail deer. To achieve this level of versatility with a rifle, you’d need a caliber that was ideal for everything from squirrels to moose. (And trust me, it doesn’t exist.) While it might seem that a versatile shotgun would be costlier than one with a narrower range of capabilities, the opposite is true. Some of the lowest-­priced shotguns on the market carry some of the highest credentials. But first, here’s a primer on shotgun terminology and how it applies to you.

Gauge: Shotguns are sized according to the bore diameter. The smallest shotgun used for hunting purposes is the .410 (rabbits and squirrels, typically), while the largest is the 10-­gauge (geese and swans). The .410 is named after its caliber measurement; the diameter of the bore is .410 inch, just as a .308 rifle cartridge is .308 inch. Shotguns that use the term gauge, such as 10-­gauge, 12-­gauge, and 20-­gauge, rely on an arcane system that correlates the bore diameter to how many lead spheres of that size it would take to make a pound of weight. A 20-­gauge shotgun has a bore diameter of .615 inch, and twenty lead balls of that size would weigh 1 pound. A 12-­gauge has a bore diameter of .729 inch; twelve lead balls of that size weigh a pound.

This will piss off a lot of shotgun snobs, including some guys who really know what they’re talking about, but the only two gauges worth considering are 20-­gauge and 12-­gauge. Ammunition for these gauges is widely available and highly versatile, and there’s no practical reason to stray into the more esoteric gauges. In recent years there’s been a lot of spirited debate about the relative attributes of 12-­gauge and 20-­gauge shotguns, spurred in particular by advances in ammunition. A person could spend days reading up on these arguments in dedicated firearms magazines, and you’re welcome to do so. But here I’m just going to cut through a lot of the BS and give you a fairly straightforward summation of the information and also a piece of advice. A 12-­gauge shotgun has bigger shells than a 20-­gauge shotgun, so it throws more pellets and it typically kicks harder. If the bulk of your hunting is going to be for smaller-­sized game, such as rabbits, quail, pheasants, et cetera, then feel free to go with a 20-­gauge. But if you’re also going to be hunting game that’s a little larger, such as turkeys, ducks, and geese, go with a 12-­gauge.

Action: While there are bolt-­action shotguns, for practical purposes we’ll limit our discussion here to autoloading, pump-­action, and break-­open shotguns. Each type has its own selling points and liabilities.

Autoloading shotguns: Sometimes called autoloaders or (incorrectly) automatic shotguns, these harness power from the shotshell in order to eject the spent round, reset the firing pin, and load a new round from the magazine. Autoloaders used to have a reputation for malfunctioning and frequent jamming, but newer models are much more reliable.

Autoloader Pros

•High rate of fire. Every time the trigger is pulled, the gun fires and cycles without the assistance of the operator; most modern semi-­auto shotguns will fire as quickly as the shooter is able to pull the trigger.

•Low recoil. Because of gas-­ or inertia-­powered cycling systems that harness some of the recoil energy, the felt recoil of the semi-­auto shotgun is less than that of pump-­actions and break-­opens.

•Ease of follow-­up shots. Because the semi-­auto shotgun cycles without the aid of the shooter, follow-­up shots can be made more efficiently due to the lack of operator movement during shooting.

Autoloader Cons

•Versatility. Due to the various cycling systems in semi-­auto shotguns, adjustments must be made to most models when switching between various loads and shell lengths.

•Safety. Due to the tension of the recoil spring, a shooter can injure himself or herself when closing the bolt. Also, unintentional shots can be made if the shooter is unfamiliar with the mechanics of the firearm.

•Difficulty of maintenance and assembly. With the various cycling systems available in semi-­auto shotguns, the operator must be familiar with all of the internal workings of the weapon when performing basic assembly and disassembly, making the weapons less user-­friendly than pump-­actions and break-­opens.

Pump-­action shotguns: Sometimes known as slide-­action shotguns, these are operated by a manually sliding forearm that ejects the spent shell, cocks the firing pin, and loads a new shell from the magazine. The number-­one-­selling shotgun of all time is the Remington 870, a pump-­action shotgun.

James Beard Book of the Year and Best International Cookbook (2016)

The James Beard Award–winning chef and co-owner of Philadelphia's Zahav restaurant reinterprets the glorious cuisine of Israel for American home kitchens.

Ever since he opened Zahav in 2008, chef Michael Solomonov has been turning heads with his original interpretations of modern Israeli cuisine, attracting notice from the New York Times, Bon Appétit, (""an utter and total revelation""), and Eater (""Zahav defines Israeli cooking in America""). 

Zahav showcases the melting-pot cooking of Israel, especially the influences of the Middle East, North Africa, the Mediterranean, and Eastern Europe. Solomonov's food includes little dishes called mezze, such as the restaurant's insanely popular fried cauliflower; a hummus so ethereal that it put Zahav on the culinary map; and a pink lentil soup with lamb meatballs that one critic called ""Jerusalem in a bowl.""  It also includes a majestic dome of Persian wedding rice and a whole roasted lamb shoulder with pomegranate and chickpeas that's a celebration in itself. All Solomonov's dishes are brilliantly adapted to local and seasonal ingredients. 

Zahav tells an authoritative and personal story of how Solomonov embraced the food of his birthplace. With its blend of technique and passion, this book shows readers how to make his food their own.",9634,"Review
James Beard Book of the Year and Best International Cookbook (2016)

""After stints working with chef Marc Vetri in Philadelphia and as head chef at Marigold Kitchen, Solomonov developed a passion for Israeli cooking and his desire to show the full breadth of the cuisine began to take shape; he started his own restaurant, Zahav, in Philadelphia in 2008. Six years later, he won the James Beard award for best chef in the Mid-Atlantic region. Solomonov shares his story as well as his wide-ranging approach to Israeli cuisine in this impressive collection of recipes that are sure to challenge readers’ preconceptions. In addition to kibbe, kugel, latke, and rugelach, Solomonov offers chicken albondigas, the Spanish tapas standard; cashew baklava cigars; and the Chocolate Almond Situation, his riff on the flourless chocolate cake. To these stunningly simple dishes he adds deliciously decadent fare such as duck and foie gras kebabs, and beluga lentil soup with marrow bones. Solomonov isn’t one for showmanship (or waste—the juices from his Israeli salad of cucumber, tomato, parsley and lemon are added to gin to create an unusual martini), and virtually all the book’s recipes are within the reach of novice cooks. The reader’s biggest challenge will likely be mastering the ubiquitous tehina sauce used as a foundation for hummus and as an accent in countless dishes. Readers with an adventurous palate and an open mind will be richly rewarded by this terrific debut.""

“I’m excited to have a compendium of Chef Solomonov’s recipes, so I can recreate them.” —
 
“The great thing about Michael Solomonov is that he simply cooks from his heart. With Zahav, he has developed perhaps one of the most innovative and thoughtful restaurants in America. After years of asking him for recipes, I'm relieved to finally have his book to answer all of my questions!” —

""The humanity of it, that's the thing. The presence. The joy. The actual connection that's forged between the person cooking and the person eating. In Zahav, the recipes don't end when the food is done cooking — there are instructions for bringing things to the table, for how to serve, for how to eat, for how to share, for how to finish...The result is cooking that feels right for both a world-class restaurant and a home kitchen, food that's both an education and a pleasure."" —

Part 1 of Designing Great Beers is a complete book in itself, focused solely on home-brewing ingredients and techniques (including three superb chapters on hops alone). Ray Daniels proves himself the ""techie"" type, infusing his introductory chapters with as much brewing math as brewing lore. Yet, Daniels never hops off the deep end of beer geekdom. Instead, he complements this emphasis on data with the creative use of graphics; where one could get bogged down in the stats, there is usually a clear visual depiction to instantly summarize their meaning.
This focus on facts continues into part 2 of Daniels's guide, where it backs an admirably pragmatic take on beer styles and their importance in home-brewing. Daniels devotes a chapter to each of 14 major style categories, detailing historical origins and modern brewing techniques. He lays a contemporary groundwork by compiling and analyzing the recipes of the National Homebrew Competition's most successful beers. The assumption is that beers deemed representative of particular beer styles in modern competitions serve as ideal models for recipe creation. Among the information provided for each style is a chart showing the percentage of brewers using each type of grain and in what proportions the grains were added. Similar data are supplied for hop varieties, yeast strains, and water treatment. This reverse engineering of award-winning beers naturally benefits experienced brewers seeking to wow judges at the next competition. Yet, even brewers taking their first shy steps into creating their own recipes have much to gain from this kind of practical analysis. Daniels provides the basic tools a brewer of any level can use to formulate recipes with confidence and creativity. --Todd Gehman

By combing through the journals that Hannah has kept for much of her life, this collection of narrative essays delivers a fuller picture of her life, her experiences, and the things she's figured out about family, faith, love, sexuality, self-worth, friendship, and fame.
Revealing what makes Hannah tick, this sometimes cringeworthy, poignant collection of stories is sure to deliver plenty of Hannah's wit and wisdom - and hopefully encourage you to try your hand at her patented brand of reckless optimism.
Personal note:
Hello, my darlings! I am incredibly pleased to present Buffering: Unshared Tales of a Life Fully Loaded!
As a big fan of memoirs, I wanted to try my hand at writing about the events of my life that deserve a little more consideration than can be accomplished in 140 characters or a six-minute vlog. Now on the cusp of turning 30, I'm ready to expose some parts of my life that I haven't shared before. Before, it was all about privacy, process, and time. And now the time has come! I'm ready to put myself out there for you.
I'm a little nervous about all these vulnerable words going into the world, these tales about my love life, the wrestling I've done with faith, how I feel about sex and my family and myself. I've had a lot of trials, a lot of errors, but also a lot of passion. Here's the thing: I've always found comfort in the stories shared by others, so I hope my stories, now that I feel ready to tell them, will bring you some comfort, too.
And when you listen to this book, please remember: Buffering is just the time it takes to process.
Enjoy!
Love,

As in her previous novels, Mones’s captivating story also brings into focus a changing China -- this time the hidden world of high culinary culture.

When Maggie McElroy, a widowed American food writer, learns of a Chinese paternity claim against her late husband’s estate, she has to go immediately to Beijing. She asks her magazine for time off, but her editor counters with an assignment: to profile the rising culinary star Sam Liang.

In China Maggie unties the knots of her husband’s past, finding out more than she expected about him and about herself. With Sam as her guide, she is also drawn deep into a world of food rooted in centuries of history and philosophy. To her surprise she begins to be transformed by the cuisine, by Sam’s family -- a querulous but loving pack of cooks and diners -- and most of all by Sam himself.

I've lived on a cattle ranch for twenty years, so venison in all its forms has always been a bit of a mystery to me. For that reason, I devoured every page of Buck, Buck, Moose. Hank Shaw lives, sleeps, eats, and breathes venison--and his passion is palpable. From laying out the ancient connection between man and deer to presenting clear, hands-on instructions for handling and cooking venison, no stone is left unturned. Hank has absolutely outdone himself, and I know this book will be enjoyed by venison enthusiasts and novices alike. --Ree Drummond, New York Times Bestselling author of The Pioneer Woman Cooks

All of the serious hunters that I hang around with -- and I hang around with a lot of them -- use Hank Shaw's wild game recipes. His stuff is authentic, fail-safe, and well-written. They oughta give this man a Nobel prize. --Steve Rinella, author and host of Meateater on Sportsman Channel

There is no reference that celebrates the outdoor lifestyle and dedication to responsibly harvesting everything antlered like Buck, Buck, Moose.

Whether shared in a cozy French bistro or in your own home, the romance and enduring appeal of French country cooking is irrefutable. Here is the book that helps you bring that spirit, those evocative dishes, into your own home.

What Ina Garten is known for—on her Food Network show and in her three previous bestselling books—is adding a special twist to familiar dishes, while also streamlining the recipes so you spend less time in the kitchen but still emerge with perfection. And that’s exactly what she offers in Barefoot in Paris. Ina’s kir royale includes the unique addition of raspberry liqueur—a refreshing alternative to the traditional crème de cassis. Her vichyssoise is brightened with the addition of zucchini, and her chocolate mousse is deeply flavored with the essence of orange. All of these dishes are true to their Parisian roots, but all offer something special—and are thoroughly delicious, completely accessible, and the perfect fare for friends and family.

Barefoot in Paris is suffused with Ina’s love of the city, of the bustling outdoor markets and alluring little shops, of the bakeries and fromageries and charcuteries—of the wonderful celebration of food that you find on every street corner, in every neighborhood.

you’ve heard about
health-conscious baking.

Simply, BabyCakes is your key to an enlightened, indulgent, sweets-filled future. This is important news not only for parents whose children have allergies, for vegans, and for others who struggle with food sensitivities, but also for all you sugar-loving traditionalists. The recipes in these pages prove that there is a healthy alternative to recklessly made desserts, one that doesn't sacrifice taste or texture.

Having experimented endlessly with alternative, health-conscious sweeteners, flours, and thickeners, Erin McKenna, the proprietress of beloved bakery BabyCakes NYC, developed these recipes–most are gluten-free, all are without refined sugar–in hopes of combating her own wheat, dairy, and sugar sensitivities. In BabyCakes, she shares detailed information about the ingredients she uses (coconut flour, xanthan gum, and agave nectar, for example) and how to substitute them properly for common ones–all the while guiding you safely through techniques she’s spent years perfecting.

When BabyCakes NYC opened on Manhattan’s Lower East Side in 2005, it helped propel the gluten-free and vegan baking movement into a new stratosphere. Suddenly there was a destination for those with wheat allergies and other dietary restrictions–and, soon enough, celebrities and dessert lovers of every kind–to indulge freely in delectable muffins and teacakes, brownies and cookies, pies and cobblers.

Enclosed within these pages are all the “secrets” you’ll need to bring the greatness of BabyCakes NYC into your own home as well as raves and recommendations from devotees such as Natalie Portman, Jason Schwartzman, Mary-Louise Parker, Zooey Deschanel, and Pamela Anderson.

For confectionists of all kinds, delicious alternatives lie within: Red Velvet Cupcakes, Chocolate Shortbread Scones with Caramelized Bananas, Strawberry Shortcake, and BabyCakes NYC’s celebrated frosting (so delicious it has fans tipping back frosting shots!), to name just a few. Finally, Erin’s blissful desserts are yours for the baking!",263967,"From Publishers Weekly
Starred Review. Diagnosed with wheat and dairy allergies in 2004, McKenna faced a life free of cupcakes, pies and brownies. Refusing to accept such a bleak future, McKenna did her research and opened Babycakes, a vegan, gluten-free bakery that has since been warmly embraced by cupcake-crazy Manhattanites. Here she shows readers how to create vegan and gluten-free versions of favorites like apple pie, chocolate chip cookies, gingerbread and Babycakes's infamous cupcakes (named best in the city by New York magazine in 2006). Her like-for-like recipes (including Healthy Hostess cupcakes and ingenious methods for dying frostings without artificial food coloring) are sure to satisfy discerning palates, and her emphasis on the traditional (blondies, biscuits, red velvet cupcakes, etc.) make her recipes easy to incorporate into the regular rotation. A number of specialty ingredients are required (agave nectar, xanthan gum, coconut oil, etc.), which can be pricey but are fairly easy to source (online vendors are listed).; Happily, however, McKenna keeps the ingredient list to a minimum. Those new to gluten- and sugar-free baking may be intimidated, but McKenna is friendly, patient, enthusiastic and encouraging. Those with dietary restrictions, and their families, will find this cookbook a sweet revelation.

In the book every home cook has been waiting for, the revered Thomas Keller turns his imagination to the American comfort foods closest to his heart—flaky biscuits, chicken pot pies, New England clam bakes, and cherry pies so delicious and redolent of childhood that they give Proust's madeleines a run for their money. Keller, whose restaurants The French Laundry in Yountville, California, and Per Se in New York have revolutionized American haute cuisine, is equally adept at turning out simpler fare.

In Ad Hoc at Home—a cookbook inspired by the menu of his casual restaurant Ad Hoc in Yountville—he showcases more than 200 recipes for family-style meals. This is Keller at his most playful, serving up such truck-stop classics as Potato Hash with Bacon and Melted Onions and grilled-cheese sandwiches, and heartier fare including beef Stroganoff and roasted spring leg of lamb. In fun, full-color photographs, the great chef gives step-by-step lessons in kitchen basics— here is Keller teaching how to perfectly shape a basic hamburger, truss a chicken, or dress a salad. Best of all, where Keller’s previous best-selling cookbooks were for the ambitious advanced cook, Ad Hoc at Home is filled with quicker and easier recipes that will be embraced by both kitchen novices and more experienced cooks who want the ultimate recipes for American comfort-food classics.",14034,"Amazon.com Review
Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2009: You don't often see the name Thomas Keller mixed with words like ""accessible"" or ""home cook,"" but with Ad Hoc at Home, the award-winning chef presents a collection of recipes destined for the center of the table at casual family gatherings. Don't throw away your whole notion of ""quick and easy,"" though, as this is still a casual cookbook filtered through the genius mind of the man behind The French Laundry Cookbook, but the sense of whimsy and the pure joy of Keller doing his version of comfort food proves irresistible. The inspiration for his restaurant Ad Hoc was the simple family meals created and served by the staff at his restaurants. As he says in the introduction, ""here is food meant to be served from big bowls and platters passed hand to hand at the table."" And with dishes like Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Pineapple Upside-Down Cake, who's going to argue with that? --Brad Thomas Parsons


From Ad Hoc at Home: Buttermilk Fried Chicken
If there's a better fried chicken, I haven't tasted it. First, and critically, the chicken is brined for 12 hours in a herb-lemon brine, which seasons the meat and helps it stay juicy. The flour is seasoned with garlic and onion powders, paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper. The chicken is dredged in the seasoned flour, dipped in buttermilk, and then dredged again in the flour. The crust becomes almost feathered and is very crisp. Fried chicken is a great American tradition that’s fallen out of favor. A taste of this, and you will want it back in your weekly routine. --Thomas Keller

From Publishers Weekly
Starred Review. Keller, one of America's most acclaimed chefs (The French Laundry; Bouchon), shifts his focus from fine dining to family-style meals for the home cook in this accessible and dazzlingly beautiful book based on the fare served at his Ad Hoc restaurant, in Napa, Calif. He does not disappoint, providing a thorough primer on the foundations of cooking, offering clear and easy-to-follow instructions on techniques such as butchering and trussing chickens and tying a pork loin. He also includes a section on becoming a better cook, which helps fine-tune the cook and instructs on using salt properly, learning to make one really good soup and getting organized. Throughout are helpful sidebars that clarify potentially murky subjects, including brining fish and meat, salad basics and using fats. Dishes such as braised beef short ribs, buttermilk fried chicken, and fig-stuffed roast pork loin highlight a vast array of offerings that range from crab cakes to shortbread cookies. This collection is what legions of Keller fans have been waiting for, a book that allows them to replicate the merest glimmer of his culinary genius in their own homes. (Nov.)

At once a memoir, a cookbook, a how-to handbook, and a delightful exploration of how the French manage to feed children without endless battles and struggles with pickiness, French Kids Eat Everything features recipes, practical tips, and ten easy-to-follow rules for raising happy and healthy young eaters—a sort of French Women Don’t Get Fat meets
Food Rules.",29934,"Review
“It takes a brave couple to move two picky–eater kids into a French small town and convert them to foodie omnivores. We have much to learn from European food traditions, and the contrast between French and North American school lunches is a striking example. A must–read for teachers and parents.” (Marion Nestle, Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at New York University and author of What to Eat)

“Humorous as well as instructive, this culinary adventure will change the lives of parents and children alike. . . . Karen Le Billon and her children learn that it’s okay to feel hungry between meals, turn to mindful eating, and learn the importance of enjoying one’s food.” (Patricia Wells, author of The Provence Cookbook)

“This book is not only about how to teach children (and yourself) to eat well and happily for life, it’s a book about how to help build and maintain the foundations of any civilized society. I loved it. Essential reading, whether you have children or not.” (Laura Calder, author of Dinner Chez Moi and host of French Food at Home)

“A wonderful―and important―book. One family’s topsy-turvy culinary transformation becomes an in-depth exploration of the habits that have kept French kids loving food (and eating spinach) for centuries.” (Elizabeth Bard, author of Lunch in Paris)

“A fascinating and valuable read.” (Lynne Rossetto Kasper)

“A breezy but practical volume for hurried parents looking to keep their kids well-fed. . . . [The] tone is straightforward, generous, and gentle. That Le Billon concludes with a small collection of kid-friendly recipes makes this foodie manifesto all the more accessible.” (Publishers Weekly)

“Le Billon . . . strategically identified questions she faced while living abroad: Why were French kids tidier eaters? Why did they sit quietly at restaurants? Why did her daughter’s teacher suggest she see a therapist when she wanted to pack her school lunch?” (BonAppetit.com)

“Portrays the stark contrast between French foodways― valuing communal meals, diverse foods and good taste― and Americans’ round-the-clock snacking and narrow, market-driven tastes…We now have the occasional course that lets us glimpse the soul nourishment that marks the French approach to food.” (Portland Press Herald)

From the Back Cover
Moving her young family to her husband's hometown in northern France, Karen Le Billon expected some cultural adjustment. But she didn't expect to be lectured for slipping her fussing toddler a snack, or to be forbidden from packing her older daughter a school lunch. Karen is intrigued by the fact that French children happily eat everything—from beets to broccoli, from salad to spinach—while French obesity rates are a fraction of what they are in North America.
Karen soon begins to see the wisdom in the ""food rules"" that the French use to foster healthy eating habits and good manners in babies and children. Some of the rules call into question both our eating habits and our parenting styles. Other rules evoke commonsense habits that we used to share but have somehow forgotten. Taken together, the rules suggest that we need to dramatically rethink the way we feed children, at home and at school.
Combining personal anecdotes with practical tips and appetizing recipes—including Zucchini and Spinach Puree and Bouillabaisse (Fish Soup) for Babies—French Kids Eat Everything is a humorous, provocative look at families, food, and children that is filled with inspiration and advice that every parent can use.

Lobster rolls containing no lobster at all. Extra-virgin olive oil that isn’t. So many fake foods are in our supermarkets, our restaurants, and our kitchen cabinets that it’s hard to know what we’re eating anymore. In Real Food / Fake Food, award-winning journalist Larry Olmsted convinces us why real food matters and empowers consumers to make smarter choices. Olmsted brings readers into the unregulated food industry, revealing the shocking deception that extends from high-end foods like olive oil, wine, and Kobe beef to everyday staples such as coffee, honey, juice, and cheese. It’s a massive bait and switch in which counterfeiting is rampant and in which the consumer ultimately pays the price. But Olmsted does more than show us what foods to avoid. A bona fide gourmand, he travels to the sources of the real stuff to help us recognize what to look for, eat, and savor: genuine Parmigiano-Reggiano from Italy, fresh-caught grouper from Florida, authentic port from Portugal. Real foods that are grown, raised, produced, and prepared with care by masters of their craft.

“Olmsted’s well-researched exposé reveals how often what we eat isn’t what it seems. (Parmesan cheese made of wood pulp or fake lobster rolls, anyone?) Eye-opening.”
—PEOPLE magazine
 
“Olmsted boldly walks readers through a course in food authenticity that covers olive oil, cheese, Champagne, seafood, steak, coffee, and more. Readers will be inspired by his intensity and clarity, and floored by how far some counterfeiters go to fool consumers and some historic food institutions go to protect their products and their names. Olmsted’s research is impressive, and he lets no stone go unturned. He lets the terrifying facts speak for themselves, adding just a little humor . . . Olmsted’s sharp language will hopefully put fires under counterfeiters everywhere . . . With the guiding hand of a good friend and prose that keeps the reader’s eye moving, Olmsted insists that readers ‘shop better and cook more.’”

“Equal parts foodie chronicle and investigative exposé . . . Real Food / Fake Food is less treatise than guidebook, showing readers how to navigate an increasingly complex food system.”

“Required reading for cooks who genuinely care about quality and health . . . a fascinating read that sheds light on our under-regulated food industry. The book also serves as a handy guide to what items consumers should avoid, and how to find and identify the real deal.”

 “A striking look at the food industry. It’s unnerving that so many people don't know what authentic olive oil or port wine tastes like because they’ve been undersold on some off-shoot knock off and no one is raising a flag until now.”


“Larry Olmstead makes you insanely hungry and steaming mad in this provocative account of how fraud threatens not just the world’s great craft foods (think caviar, Kobe beef, and Parmigiano-Reggiano) but our everyday diet. A must-read for anyone who cares deeply about the safety of our food and the welfare our planet.”


“Do not take another bite or swallow another sip of anything, for your sake and the sake of your children, before reading . It is the health equivalent of Ralph Nader's expose . The content blows the doors off the kitchens.” 


“Larry Olmsted’s meticulously researched is chilling for what he uncovers about the food industry. At the same time his love of great food and his skill in writing about it make me want to try every one of the real foods he recommends. A must-read for anyone with an interest in, well, eating.”

“In his solidly researched new book, food and travel columnist Olmsted, a well-traveled and knowledgeable food writer, takes readers on an enlightening but frequently disturbing culinary journey. While providing fascinating insights into where and how some of the most delicious food products are produced, the author also reveals how often these are imitated to detrimental effect…A provocative yet grounded look at the U.S. food industry.”

Where's the Kobe Beef?: More than 99.9 percent of the so-called Kobe beef sold in this country is Fake.

Parmesan-Gate: Most Parmesan cheese sold in the United States, grated or whole, cheap or expensive, is Fake.

The Restaurant Scam: Restaurants can claim any food is organic or dry aged, heritage breed or wild caught. Even names of farms and types of fish are misrepresented to justify higher prices.

Though widely considered the healthiest fat, 75 to 80 percent of the extra-virgin olive oil sold in this country is Fake, and some is even dangerous.

DNA testing was used to compare the fish that menus offered with the actual species brought to the table in New York City sushi restaurants. In the largest study, 100 percent of the restaurants had lied.

A third of the seafood sold in this country is intentionally mislabeled.

The most transformative cookbook of the century celebrates this milestone by showcasing the genius of chef/proprietor Thomas Keller himself. Keller is a wizard, a purist, a man obsessed with getting it right. And this, his first cookbook, is every bit as satisfying as a French Laundry meal itself: a series of small, impeccable, highly refined, intensely focused courses.

Most dazzling is how simple Keller's methods are: squeegeeing the moisture from the skin on fish so it sautées beautifully; poaching eggs in a deep pot of water for perfect shape; the initial steeping in the shell that makes cooking raw lobster out of the shell a cinch; using vinegar as a flavor enhancer; the repeated washing of bones for stock for the cleanest, clearest tastes.

From innovative soup techniques, to the proper way to cook green vegetables, to secrets of great fish cookery, to the creation of breathtaking desserts; from beurre monté to foie gras au torchon, to a wild and thoroughly unexpected take on coffee and doughnuts, The French Laundry Cookbook captures, through recipes, essays, profiles, and extraordinary photography, one of America's great restaurants, its great chef, and the food that makes both unique.

One hundred and fifty superlative recipes are exact recipes from the French Laundry kitchen—no shortcuts have been taken, no critical steps ignored, all have been thoroughly tested in home kitchens. If you can't get to the French Laundry, you can now re-create at home the very experience Wine Spectator described as “as close to dining perfection as it gets.”



 ",9938,"Amazon.com Review
To eat at Thomas Keller's Napa Valley restaurant, The French Laundry, is to experience a peak culinary experience. In The French Laundry Cookbook, Keller articulates his passions and offers home cooks a means to duplicate the level of perfection that makes him one of the best chefs in the U.S. and, arguably, the world.
This cookbook provides 150 recipes exactly as they are used at Keller's restaurant. It is also his culinary manifesto, in which he shares the unique creative processes that led him to invent Peas and Carrots--a succulent pillow of a lobster paired with pea shoots and creamy ginger-carrot sauce--and other high-wire culinary acts. It offers unimagined experiences, from extracting chlorophyll to use in coloring sauces to a recipe for chocolate cake accompanied by red beet ice cream and a walnut sauce. You are urged to follow Keller's recipes precisely and also to view them as blueprints. To keep them alive, they must be infused with your own commitment to perfection and pleasure, as you define those terms.
Keller's story, shared through the writing of Michael Ruhlman, shows how this chef was both born and made. After winning rave reviews when he was still in his 20s, it took a more experienced chef throwing a knife at him because he did not know how to truss a chicken to open his eyes to the importance of the discipline and techniques of classical French cooking. To acquire these fundamental skills, he apprenticed at eight of the finest restaurants in France.
Grounded in classic technique, Keller's cooking is characterized by traditional marriages of ingredients, assembled in breathtakingly daring new ways, such as Pearls and Oyster, glistening caviar and oysters served on a bed of creamy pearl tapioca. Continually piquing the palate, his meals are a procession of 5 to 10 dishes, all small portions vibrantly composed. For example, Pan Roasted Breast of Squab with Swiss Chard, Seared Foie Gras, and Oven-Dried Black Figs require just three birds to serve six. The result: you are never sated, always stimulated.

From Publishers Weekly
""Cooking is not about convenience, and it's not about shortcuts. Take your time. Move slowly and deliberately, and with great attention,"" writes Keller, the owner of the French Laundry in Napa Valley who was named 1997's best chef in America by the James Beard Foundation. At a decidedly unhurried pace, Keller delivers 150 recipes that reflect the perfectionism that catapulted him to national acclaim. With few exceptions (e.g., Gazpacho, Eric's Staff Lasagne), recipes are haute, labor-intensive preparations: Lobster Consomm? en Gel?e, Warm Fruitwood-Smoked Salmon with Potato Gnocchi and Balsamic Glaze, or Braised Stuffed Pig's Head. Tongue-in-cheek recipe names like ""Macaroni and Cheese"" (aka Butter-Poached Maine Lobster with Creamy Lobster Broth and Mascarpone-Enriched Orzo) and ""Banana Split"" (actually, Poached Banana Ice Cream with White Chocolate-Banana Crepes and Chocolate Sauce) belie the complexity of the dishes. Throughout, Keller conveys his vision as a culinary artist in spare, meticulous prose, emphasizing form over expedience: ""the great challenge [of cooking] is... to derive deep satisfaction from the mundane.""

In Barefoot Contessa Family Style, Ina explains that sharing our lives and tables with those we love is too essential to be saved just for special occasions—and it’s easy to do if you know how to cook irresistible meals with a minimum of fuss.

For Ina, the best way to make guests feel at home is to serve them food that’s as unpretentious as it is delicious. So in her new book, she’s collected the recipes that please her friends and family most—dishes like East Hampton Clam Chowder, Parmesan Roasted Asparagus, and Linguine with Shrimp Scampi. It’s the kind of fresh, accessible food that’s meant to be passed around the table in big bowls or platters and enjoyed with warm conversation and laughter.

In Ina’s hands tried-and-true dishes are even more delicious than you remember them: Her arugula salad is bright with the flavors of lemon and Parmesan, the Oven-Fried Chicken is crispy without excess fat, and her Deep-Dish Apple Pie has the perfect balance of fruit and spice. Barefoot Contessa Family Style also includes enticing recipes that are memorable and distinctive, like Lobster Cobb Salad, Tequila Lime Chicken, and Saffron Risotto with Butternut Squash.

With vivid photographs of Ina cooking and serving food in her beautiful Hamptons home, as well as menu suggestions, practical wisdom on what to do when disaster strikes in the kitchen, and tips on creating an inviting ambience with music, Barefoot Contessa Family Style is the must-have guide to the joy of everyday entertaining.",15641,"From Publishers Weekly
This second book follows the same basic premise as Garten's phenomenally popular Barefoot Contessa Cookbook: simple, elegant home cooking with good ingredients and a minimum of fuss. It takes a certain amount of chutzpah to include ordinary chicken noodle soup and mashed potatoes and gravy in a cookbook, but Garten pulls it off with heart and style. Dinners are conceived as crowd-pleasers, with a big nod to Italian home-cooking: oven-fried chicken, penne with five cheeses, Sunday rib roast, risotto, lasagna. Like other cookbooks with a specialty-shop pedigree (such as Silver Palate), Garten's book is inflected with a certain catering mentality-a lot of salmon, sun-dried tomatoes, the inevitable Curry Chicken Salad, the forgiving and easy Chicken with Tabbouleh. However, these recipes manage to seem not dated but just reasonable solutions to the eternal problem set of practicality, flavor and time. With photographs of the dishes on nearly every spread and a nice, open format, Garten's book is easy to use. Sections on desserts, kids, and brunch complete this fine snapshot of real-life cooking and the joys of eating in.

From Library Journal
Garten's first two books featuring recipes from the Barefoot Contessa, her gourmet takeout shop in East Hampton, NY, have sold more than 400,000 copies. Her latest repeats the appealing format of those titles, offering sophisticated but easy recipes and an attractive design featuring dozens of color photographs, mostly closeups of the recipes but including some casual shots of the author, friends, and family. Garten's ""family style"" cooking includes dishes like Chicken Noodle Soup and Parker's Fish & Chips (separate chapters are devoted to breakfast and kids' foods), but there are also elegant dishes like Tuna Tartare, Saffron Risotto, and Lobster Cobb Salad, not exactly everyday fare. Sure to be popular.

The extraordinary Cajun and Creole cooking of South Louisiana has roots going back over two hundred years, and today it is the one really vital, growing regional cuisine in America. No one is more responsible than Paul Prudhomme for preserving and expanding the Louisiana tradition, which he inherited from his own Cajun background.
Chef Prudhomme's incredibly good food has brought people from all over America and the world to his restaurant, K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen, in New Orleans. To set down his recipes for home cooks, however, he did not work in the restaurant. In a small test kitchen, equipped with a home-size stove and utensils normal for a home kitchen, he retested every recipe two and three times to get exactly the results he wanted. Logical though this is, it was an unprecedented way for a chef to write a cookbook. But Paul Prudhomme started cooking in his mother's kitchen when he was a youngster. To him, the difference between home and restaurant procedures is obvious and had to be taken into account.
So here, in explicit detail, are recipes for the great traditional dishes--gumbos and jambalayas, Shrimp Creole, Turtle Soup, Cajun ""Popcorn,"" Crawfish Etouffee, Pecan Pie, and dozens more--each refined by the skill and genius of Chef Prudhomme so that they are at once authentic and modern in their methods.
Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen is also full of surprises, for he is unique in the way he has enlarged the repertoire of Cajun and Creole food, creating new dishes and variations within the old traditions. Seafood Stuffed Zucchini with Seafood Cream Sauce, Panted Chicken and Fettucini, Veal and Oyster Crepes, Artichoke Prudhomme--these and many others are newly conceived recipes, but they could have been created only by a Louisiana cook. The most famous of Paul Prudhomme's original recipes is Blackened Redfish, a daringly simple dish of fiery Cajun flavor that is often singled out by food writers as an example of the best of new American regional cooking.
For Louisianians and for cooks everywhere in the country, this is the most exciting cookbook to be published in many years.",10618,"Amazon.com Review
There was once a time when words like étouffée, tasso, and jambalaya were hardly known outside of the Cajun and Creole communities of Louisiana. Then along came Chef Paul Prudhomme, and all of that changed. Big enough to be his own force of nature, Prudhomme all but single-handedly turned Cajun cooking into a national food trend, changing forever the way many a cook thinks about spicing food. And Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen was the book that made it happen. But guess what? It's still happening, and so is the book!
Anyone looking for a primer on Cajun cooking need look no farther. Chef Paul takes the reader by the hand and opens up a world that includes four kinds of roux, Jalapeno and Cheese Rolls, Shrimp Étouffée, and the to-die-for Cajun Meatloaf. Good old-fashioned Red Beans and Rice and Sweet Potato Pecan Pie are not forgotten either.
Chef Paul tested all of his recipes in a home kitchen using common culinary tools--no professional equipment needed here. These are recipes that are high in spice, so remember to have a large vat of water on hand! --Schuyler Ingle
Review
""It is no exaggeration to say that the finest and most definitive regional cooking in America is that of Louisiana, generally known as Cajun and Creole....Paul Prudhomme is the panjandrum--the greatest authority and practitioner--of that school of cookery and his book is absolutely essential on the cookbook shelves of anyone who cares about a great aspect of American cuisine.""-- Craig Claiborne""Paul Prudhomme cooks up unique and exciting combinations of flavors with unusual foods generously spiced with his Cajun humor and joy.""-- Alice Waters of ""Chez Panisse, "" Berkeley, California""At long last, the alchemy of Cajun-Creole cooking made possible for everyone!...Paul Prudhomme is a free culinary spirit, an American original, and his delicious new cookbook is bound to be a classic.""-- Jean Anderson, author of ""The Grassroots Cookbook"" and co-author of ""The New Doubleday Cookbook""""For years amateur and professional chefs alike have waited patiently for Paul Prudhomme to share in print the recipes for his wonderful Cajun and Creole dishes, and I think it's safe to say that this collection will serve for years to come as a definitive statement on America's most exciting style of regional cooking.""-- James Villas

Why are people gaining weight faster than ever before? The idea that people simply eat too much is no longer supported by science. The emerging idea is that weight gain is a survival response: Our bodies are under attack from all directions—an overabundance of processed food, a polluted world, and the pressures of daily life all take their toll. These attacks hit a very important set of glands, the adrenals, particularly hard. 
The adrenal glands maintain a normal cortisol rhythm (cortisol is a hormone associated with both stress and fat storage). When this rhythm is off, we can become overwhelmed more quickly, fatigued, gain weight, and eventually, develop even more severe health issues such as heart disease or diabetes.
In The Adrenal Reset Diet, Dr. Alan Christianson provides a pioneering plan for optimal function of these small but powerful organs. His patient-tested weight-loss program is the culmination of decades of clinical experience and over 75,000 patient-care visits. In a study at his clinic, participants on the Adrenal Reset Diet reset their cortisol levels by over 50% while losing an average of over 2 inches off their waists and 9 pounds of weight in 30 days. What can you expect? 
• Learn whether your adrenals are Stressed, Wired and Tired, or Crashed and which adrenal tonics, exercises, and foods are best for you
• The clinically proven shakes, juices, and other delicious recipes, to use for your Reset
• New ways to turn off the triggers of weight gain with carbohydrate cycling, circadian repair, and simple breathing exercises
• An easy 7-day ARD eating plan to move your and your adrenals from Surviving to Thriving",25993,"Review

Fernando first sees Marlena across the Piazza San Marco and falls in love from afar. When he sees her again in a Venice café a year later, he knows it’s fate. He knows little English; she, a divorced American chef traveling through Italy, speaks only food-based Italian. Marlena thought she was done with romantic love, incapable of intimacy. Yet within months of their first meeting, she quits her job, sells her house in St. Louis, kisses her two grown sons goodbye, and moves to Venice to marry “the stranger,” as she calls Fernando.

This deliciously satisfying memoir is filled with the foods and flavors of Italy and peppered with culinary observations and recipes. But the main course here is an enchanting true story about a woman who falls in love with both a man and a city, and finally finds the home she didn’t even know she was missing.

Product Description
Finally a book that combines the fresh, exuberant flavors of great Italian food with the ease and comfort of a slow cooker. Michele Scicolone, a best-selling author and an authority on Italian cooking, shows how good ingredients and simple techniques can lift the usual ""crockpot"" fare into the dimension of fine food. Pasta with Meat and Mushroom Ragu, Osso Buco with Red Wine, Chicken with Peppers and Mushrooms: These are dishes that even the most discriminating cook can proudly serve to company, yet all are so carefree that anyone with just five or ten minutes of prep time can make them on a weekday and return to perfection.
Simmered in the slow cooker, soups, stews, beans, grains, pasta sauces, and fish are as healthy as they are delicious. Polenta and risotto, ""stir-crazy"" dishes that ordinarily need careful timing, are effortless. Meat loaves come out perfectly moist, tough cuts of meat turn succulent, and cheesecakes emerge flawless.

Recipe Excerpts from The Italian Slow CookerRead more
From Publishers Weekly
Scicolone (The Sopranos Family Cookbook) turns her attention to the slow cooker (or crockpot) for preparing homey Italian dishes. In this accessible cookbook, she presents unintimidating recipes (which often suggest the ingredients simmer around 165 degrees for six to eight hours) that serve up hearty dishes with a minimum of fuss. The wide variety of main dishes—seafood, meats, veggies and legumes—and corresponding soups and sauces, capitalize on the flavor that only slow-cooked food can deliver. The sauces are the book's standouts, with recipes for ragus made with chunky pork shoulder or spicy Tuscan sausage, for example. She also includes recipes for a creamy polenta with gorgonzola and mascarpone; risotto-style farro with parmesan; seafood couscous made with halibut, shrimp and scallops; and braised beef with anchovies and rosemary. While her approach is certainly inventive and appealing, some recipes make one wonder whether a slow cooker is actually necessary (the stuffed peppers might be baked just as easily). That said, this cookbook will certainly relieve the time pressure on busy family cooks. (Dec.)

(Well, almost.) Here, finally, are the books that Brown’s legion of fans have been salivating for―two volumes that together will provide an unexpurgated record of his long-running, award-winning Food Network TV series, Good Eats. 
 From “Pork Fiction” (on baby back ribs), to “Citizen Cane” (on caramel sauce), to “Oat Cuisine” (on oatmeal), every hilarious episode is represented. Each book―the second will be published in fall 2010―is illustrated with behind-the-scenes photos taken on the Good Eats set. Each contains more than 140 recipes and more than 1,000 photographs and illustrations, along with explanations of techniques, lots of food-science information (of course!), and more food puns, food jokes, and food trivia than you can shake a wooden spoon at.",36774,"From Publishers Weekly
Every so often a cookbook comes along that wishes it were a television show. Brown's latest effort actually is a television show, or rather, a marathon of all 80 episodes from the first six seasons of his Food Network hit. Egotistical yet thrifty, Brown interviews himself in the introduction, describing this work as four hundred pages of liner notes. And that is sadly accurate. For all its girth, there are merely 140 recipes, ranging from chocolate syrup to butternut dumplings with brown butter and sage. That these entries appear sequentially exemplifies the book's biggest problem; it is organized by TV episode number, causing readers to repeatedly visit the index to make sure they're not missing anything. The roast turkey is toward the beginning of the book, for example, but the turkey salad is hiding out somewhere in the middle. Recipes that never made it into the show! are promised, but good luck identifying them, and is that really a bonus? Accompanying each meal is a chart labeled, Knowledge Concentrate. These contain the fun, quasi-scientific facts that are the author's bread and butter (The higher the egg-to-dairy ratio, the firmer the custard). The remainder of the pages are cluttered with photo strips, sketches and squiggly lines, lest you get bored and turn on the tube. (Oct.)

Root cellaring, as many people remember but only a few people still practice, is a way of using the earth's naturally cool, stable temperature to store perishable fruits and vegetables. Root cellaring, as Mike and Nancy Bubel explain here, is a no-cost, simple, low-technology, energy-saving way to keep the harvest fresh all year long.
In Root Cellaring, the Bubels tell how to successfully use this natural storage approach. It's the first book devoted entirely to the subject, and it covers the subject with a thoroughness that makes it the only book you'll ever need on root cellaring.
Root Cellaring will tell you:
* How to choose vegetable and fruit varieties that will store best
* Specific individual storage requirements for nearly 100 home garden crops
* How to use root cellars in the country, in the city, and in any environment
* How to build root cellars, indoors and out, big and small, plain and fancy
* Case histories -- reports on the root cellaring techniques and experiences of many households all over North America
Root cellaring need not be strictly a country concept. Though it's often thought of as an adjunct to a large garden, a root cellar can in fact considerably stretch the resources of a small garden, making it easy to grow late succession crops for storage instead of many rows for canning and freezing. Best of all, root cellars can easily fit anywhere. Not everyone can live in the country, but everyone can benefit from natural cold storage.

“I’m not a girl and if I was odds are I wouldn’t come close to qualifying as a ‘California’ girl. But gosh-darn it, now that Gaby’s book is finally here I can eat like one.

     The traditional foods movement is a fad-free approach to cooking and eating that emphasizes nutrient-dense, real food, and values quality, environment, and community over the convenience of processed, additive-laden products that are the norm on grocery store shelves. 
     Based on the research of Weston A. Price, who studied the diets of indigenous peoples to understand the relationship between nutrition and health, a traditional foods diet avoids processed ingredients, but allows meat, animal fat, and grains. It embraces cultured dairy, such as kefir and yogurt, that contain beneficial bacteria; fermented foods, such as sauerkraut and kombucha, that are rich in probiotics; and organ meats that are packed with vitamins and minerals. It also celebrates locally grown foods. By choosing ingredients from nearby sources, you create a stronger connection to your food, and have a better understanding what you’re eating and how it was produced. 
     In The Nourished Kitchen, Jennifer McGruther guides you through her traditional foods kitchen and offers more than 160 recipes inspired by  the seasons, land, and waters around her. In the morning, fuel up with Eggs Poached in Fiery Tomato Sauce. On a hot summer day, Cucumber Salad with Dill and Kefir is a cooling side dish, and on a chilly fall evening, Barley in Broth with Bacon and Kale offers comfort and warmth. Old-Fashioned Meat Loaf with Gravy makes a hearty family meal, while Chicken in Riesling with Peas can be the centerpiece of an elegant supper. Satisfy your sweet tooth with Maple-Roasted Pears, and quench your thirst with naturally fermented Vanilla Mint Soda. With the benefit of Jennifer’s experience, you can craft a loaf of Whole Wheat and Spelt Sourdough Bread and stock your kitchen with Spiced Sour Pickles with Garlic.
     The Nourished Kitchen not only teaches how to prepare wholesome, nourishing foods, but also encourages a mindful approach cooking and a celebration of old-world culinary traditions that have sustained healthy people for millennia. Whether you’re already a practitioner of the traditional foods lifestyle or simply trying to incorporate more natural, highly nutritious foods into your routine, you will find plenty to savor in The Nourished Kitchen.",76263,"From Booklist
Following the precepts of dentist-nutritionist Weston Price, McGruther has developed a system for healthy eating based on lots of vegetables and grains as cooked and preserved on early twentieth-century American farms. What differentiates McGruther’s approach from other regimens is her unabashed advocacy of animal fats. She is especially fond of cooking foods in lard, noting its fat-content profile’s similarity to that of olive oil. When sweetness is an object, McGruther suggests replacing refined sugar with honey, molasses, sorghum, or maple syrup. Bread recipes specify ancient grains such as einkorn, and leavening comes from sourdough. She favors making one’s own butter when possible, and she recommends drinking that by-product of churning: buttermilk. Her meat dishes will satisfy carnivores, whether with a rich rabbit pie studded with bacon and chanterelles or with a rare-roasted elk steak. McGruther advocates sustainable agriculture, and she enthusiastically preserves summer’s bounty through fermentation for pickles, sauerkraut, and relishes. --Mark Knoblauch

They can wash it all down with a cup of the Pond’s Wedding Punch.

Marjorie Druker is passionate about soups. She fell in love with soups when she first heard the story Stone Soup. After attending Johnston & Whales, Marjorie created the menu for the popular Boston Market restaurant chain, and soups were always her favorite. ""My niche is taking what people like to eat and turning it into a soup,"" she says.
The New England Soup Factory restaurant has won the Best of Boston award four times. People skip school to eat their soups. A pregnant in labor stopped by the restaurant on the way to the hospital to satisfy a last-minute craving. New England Soup Factory soups are like no other soups. And now you can recreate these delicious soups in your own home. The New England Soup Factory Cookbook contains 100 of Boston's best-tasting traditional and creative soup recipes. The book also includes a chapter on sandwiches and salads to accompany such soups as . . .
New England Clam Chowder
Wild Mushroom and Barley Soup
Curried Crab and Coconut Soup
Raspberry-Nectarine Gazpacho
Cucumber-Buttermilk Soup",17829,"From Publishers Weekly
Starred Review. Druker, executive chef and co-owner of Massachusetts eatery the New England Soup Factory, joins veteran Boston-based food writer Silverstein to weave personal stories of the region with mouthwatering recipes in this instant classic, a must-have for soup lovers. Standards like Beef and Barley, Split Pea with Bacon and Potatoes, and Hot and Sour Soup sit comfortably next to innovative combinations such as Butternut Squash Soup with Calvados, Gorgonzola Cheese and Prosciutto or Yellow Tomato Soup with Jasmine Rice. Aside from the stock-making, which Druker and Silverstein heartily endorse, most of the soups and accompanying sides come together in minutes, producing a quick, hearty meal that few dishes can match for sheer satisfaction. Many recipes highlight just a handful of ingredients (Roasted Yellow Beet and Pear Soup with Blue Cheese; Sweet and Sour Cabbage Soup with Dill; Apple, Onion and Cheddar Soup) and call for little else, keeping recipes simple, costs low and flavors bold. Recipes are grouped intuitively by theme (cheese, chicken, chowders, etc.) as well as by season, ensuring that the perfect bowl of soup is never far away.

Avoid red meat. Eat whole grains. Could it all be a lie? We live in an era of health hype and nutrition propaganda, and we are suffering for it. Decades of avoiding egg yolks, choosing margarine over butter, and replacing the real foods of our ancestors with low-fat, processed, packaged substitutes have left us with an obesity epidemic, ever-rising rates of chronic disease, and, above all, total confusion about what to eat and why. This is a tragedy of misinformation, food industry shenanigans, and cheap calories disguised as health food. It turns out that everything we've been told about how to eat is wrong. Fat and cholesterol are harmful to your health? Nope - they are crucial to your health. Whole grains are health food? Not even close. Counting calories is the way to lose weight? Not gonna work - nutrients are what matter. Nutrition can come from a box, bag, or capsule? Don't count on it!
In Eat the Yolks, Liz Wolfe debunks all these myths and more, revealing what's behind the lies and bringing the truth about fat, cholesterol, protein, and carbs to light. You'll be amazed at the tall tales we've been told in the name of healthy eating. With wit and grace, Wolfe makes a compelling argument for a diet based on Paleo foods. She takes us back to the foods of our ancestors, combining the lessons of history with those of modern science to uncover why real, whole food - the kind humans ate for thousands of years before modern nutrition dogma led us astray - holds the key to amazing health and happy taste buds. In Eat the Yolks, Liz Wolfe doesn't just make a case for eating the whole egg.

""...hands down the best mead how-to book... If you make mead... you *need* this book... "" -- Vicki Rowe, Webmistress and meadmaker, www.gotmead.com, July 15, 2003
From the Author
My goal in writing this book is to begin bringing to meadmakers the breadth and depth of knowledge and resources that are available to beer brewers and winemakers. I sought to cover the many aspects of meadmaking in a comprehensive but easy-to-read fashion, and to provide readers with an understanding of the role quality ingredients play in creating a really pleasing mead.
This complex, diverse and romantic drink deserves more attention than it has received in print. It can range from bone dry to profoundly sweet, and can be crafted to complement any type of food. If I spread some of my enthusiasm for mead, and for this simple, fun and remarkably rewarding hobby, then I will have succeeded at my task.

This is not only a fabulous cookbook that has helped thousands of families establish a climate of joy and concern for others at mealtime, it can help you improve your nutrition and save money, too. It outlines three ways to eat more-with-less and invites us to consider the global implications of our dietary choices. There are sidebars with stories, pictures, prayers and verses, making this truly a distinctively Christian cookbook, solid with great recipes, and wholesome, faithful ideas scattered through-out. We have some friends that have literally worn out several of these, as they are truly that useful---with simple, helpful stuff about complimentary proteins and ways to create meals that respect what is now called sustainable agriculture. As it says on the back, these recipes are kind to your wallet, your waistline, and the larger world. Three cheers for the Mennonite Central Committee and their good work bringing global concerns to the table in such a refreshing, pleasant way. 500 recipes!

Young,Shelley Redford Young",4.3,316,11.99,10.86,,"Reveals how pH levels, the most important measurement in the blood system, directly impact weight loss and are affected by diet, and discusses what foods to eat, what foods to avoid, and which supplements promote weight loss and a healthier lifestyle.",705053,"Amazon.com Review
In many ways, The pH Miracle is reminiscent of an earlier generation of diet books. Much of the focus is on an intestinal cleansing program, followed by a diet that is 70 to 80 percent vegetables, coupled with a tremendous selection of supplements that authors Robert and Shelley Young recommend to everyone, no matter what their age, gender, or state of health.
The Youngs point their fingers at candida as a main culprit in the poor health of many people. Unfortunately, they back up their claims with only vague references, such as ""a 1991 study"" and ""a leading cancer researcher."" Many readers may wish for more specific evidence, but instead will have to make do with enthusiastic recommendations, alphabetized lists of vegetables, and pleasing chapters with vegetarian recipes that taste good no matter how you feel about the diet as a whole.
Sprinkled throughout the book are short testimonials of people who were able to reverse cancer, improve their digestion, and lower their cholesterol by following these recommendations, and it's hard to argue with the cholesterol-lowering results that a 70 percent vegetable diet will achieve. Still, the medical value of much else in the book remains hotly contested, and as always, it's wise to check with your doctor before starting off in search of miracles. --Jill Lightner

The 300 recipes will seduce a new generation of bakers, whether their favorite kitchen tools are a bowl and a whisk or a stand mixer and a baker’s torch.

Even the most homey of the recipes are very special. Dorie’s favorite raisin swirl bread. Big spicy muffins from her stint as a baker in a famous New York City restaurant. French chocolate brownies (a Parisian pastry chef begged for the recipe). A dramatic black and white cake for a “wow” occasion. Pierre Hermé’s extraordinary lemon tart.
The generous helpings of background information, abundant stories, and hundreds of professional hints set Baking apart as a one-of-a-kind cookbook. And as if all of this weren’t more than enough, Dorie has appended a fascinating minibook, A Dessertmaker’s Glossary, with more than 100 entries, from why using one’s fingers is often best, to how to buy the finest butter, to how the bundt pan got its name.",33416,"Amazon.com Review
In Baking with Julia (Child, of course) and Desserts by Pierre Hermé, Dorrie Greenspan gave voice to other baking experts while ensuring their recipes worked. Now, in Baking: From My Home to Yours, she steps fully onstage with a collection of 230-plus immediately attractive recipes ranging from breakfast sweets, cakes, and tarts to puddings, custards, ice creams, and crisps. This is homey, eminently doable baking that encompasses the more familiar, like sugar-topped molasses spice cookies, pecan sticky buns, and lemon tart, but also includes the temptingly original, such as Devil’s Food White-Out Cake, Coconut-Roasted Pineapple Dacquoise, and Toasted Almond Scones. Her cookie selection, which offers the standout Chocolate Malted Whopper Drops, is particularly good, as is her brownie group, a mini-chapter featuring a very edible espresso cheesecake variation.
Greenspan knows her stuff, of course, but it's her droll, anecdotal style (readers learn, for example how a chocolate cake got her fired) and her recipe-making expertise that sets the book apart. Precise descriptions of the baked goods--a pound cake, for example, is said to have a ""moist, tightly knit crumb""--help readers understand baking anatomy. Equally exact, and reassuring, are her recipe guideposts--she notes, for example, that rubbing butter into the dry ingredients when making a biscuit recipe will result in ""pea-size pieces, pieces the size of oatmeal flakes, and pieces the size of everything in between."" With recipe variations and enticing color photos, the book will inspire--and inform--baking novices and experts alike. --Arthur Boehm

From Publishers Weekly
Starred Review. Greenspan, coauthor of books with culinary icons such as Julia Child (Baking with Julia), Daniel Boulud and Pierre Hermé, shares her favorite recipes in this tantalizing collection, which covers all the baking bases, from muffins, cookies and brownies to spoon desserts, pies and cobblers. Instructions are clear and easy to follow, and Greenspan uses everyday ingredients readily available to the home chef. Recipes like Perfection Pound Cake and All-American, All-Delicious Apple Pie convey a comfortable, almost homey, familiarity that will bring readers back to this collection again and again. In addition, she provides insight into matters many cooks may not often consider, such as leaveners, technique and choosing the right pan. Numerous mouth-watering photos dot the book throughout, making it hard to choose which one to make first. Especially helpful is the Indispensables: Base Recipes section at the end of the book, which includes pointers for making key ingredients such dough, pastry cream, lemon curd and faux crème fraîche. This is baking at its best. Over 100 full-color photos. (Nov.)

Whether you are seeing a doctor, nutritionist, or a trainer, all of them advise to eat more protein. Foods, drinks, and supplements are loaded with extra protein. Many people use protein for weight control, to gain or lose pounds, while others believe it gives them more energy and is essential for a longer, healthier life. Now, Dr. Garth Davis, an expert in weight loss asks, “Is all this protein making us healthier?”
The answer, he emphatically argues, is NO. Too much protein is actually making us sick, fat, and tired, according to Dr. Davis. If you are getting adequate calories in your diet, there is no such thing as protein deficiency. The healthiest countries in the world eat far less protein than we do and yet we have an entire nation on a protein binge getting sicker by the day.
As a surgeon treating obese patients, Dr. Davis was frustrated by the ever-increasing number of sick and overweight patients, but it wasn't until his own health scare that he realized he could do something about it.

INTRODUCTION

Quick show of hands: How many people have rapidly lost a significant amount of weight on the 17 Day Diet? Let’s see, that’s one, two, three . . . uh, looks like a lot of people.

Now, I’m happy to say that you’re going to be able lose even more weight and enjoy it even more with this brand-new cookbook.

Introducing The 17 Day Diet Cookbook.

Before you start to panic, rest assured that you don’t need to shout and jump and spin knives, make meals that look like a major work of art, or get a degree from Le Cordon Bleu. All you need are some easy-to-follow, easy-to-prepare recipes that are extraordinarily delicious. This cookbook gives you all that and more.

Most of the recipes can be prepared in 30 minutes or less. There are no long lists of ingredients, complicated cooking methods, or hard-to-understand directions. All the recipes are built around the foods you eat on the 17 Day Diet.

The 17 Day Diet is a 4-cycle nutrition program that makes it fast and easy to lose weight, without feeling deprived or hungry all the time. With this companion cookbook, you’ll have delectable recipes at your fingertips so you can lose even more weight without giving up delicious foods. It’s the perfect way for people with refined palates to lose weight and get healthy. As a family practice physician and an advocate of preventive health, I believe healthy food can still be wonderful. I refuse to accept that a diet has to involve going to extremes or that diet food has to taste like cardboard. It doesn’t! It just has to be thoughtfully prepared, in a reasonable amount of time, and taste incredibly good. That’s the kind of food you’ll find in this book.

I encourage you to try several of these recipes each week to reap the benefits. Broken record, I know, but if you’re going to eat healthily and lose more weight, you need to cook more at home. When you do, you have control over what you eat and more control over how much weight you ultimately lose. My nutrition team has developed recipes that taste good and are high in nutrition. We use ingredients that are mainly found in your average grocery store. Use these recipes, and you may never feel like you’re on a diet, either!

What I enjoyed most about putting this cookbook together was that I got to sample and test new recipes before they appeared in this book. Some of my favorites are Polynesian London Broil, Tuscan Pork Tenderloin, Crab Cakes, Open-Faced Reuben, Spiced Edamame, Microwaved Mashed Potatoes, Mexican Chocolate Pudding, Chocolaty Frozen Yogurt . . . well, I could go on and on. They’re all my favorites!

I’d like to emphasize, too, that cooking at home can also save you a bundle, because you’ll likely spend less buying groceries than eating out, and it even can make dating cheaper. After all, who isn’t impressed by a partner who knows how to cook? Restaurants must charge high prices in order to pay their employees and other bills. If you cook at home, you design the menu and keep the tips yourself! For health and wealth, there’s just no match for a good home-cooked meal, so please start serving more of them.

Home cooking isn’t rocket science, either. Lots of us cook and eat. And lots of us love to talk about cooking and eating. We’re obsessed with food. With all due respect to baseball, eating is America’s real national pastime.

Personally, I just love food. Food and I go way back, more than 43 years now. One of my favorite ways to relax from a day at my office is to come home, roll up my sleeves, and fire up the oven. I’m quite satisfied in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes, sipping a glass of wine, and enjoying what I’ve created. And you’ll get to enjoy some of these creations right here in this book.

So, if you’re in a dietary rut, want to lose even more weight, or are in need of a little inspiration, is for you!



The 17 Day Diet is a 4-cycle program designed to take weight off rapidly. Isn’t that what you want? Hardly anyone I know likes to endure depressingly slow weight loss. We want to be trim now, look great now, and feel great now. The 17 Day Diet gets you to where you want to be quickly, without a lot of sacrifice, hunger pangs, or cravings. The diet is nutritionally sound, easy to follow, and it works. I call it the best thing since the sliced bread you’ll give up (but only for the first 2 cycles).

Trust me, this is a phenomenal diet. I’ve had people lose 10 to 12 pounds over the first 17 days, and kept losing steadily right down to their goals. Of course, individuals do vary in their results. The beauty of this program is that you won’t get discouraged or bored by the prospect of staying on a diet for what seems like forever because you’re shedding fat so quickly. You’ll love the fact that in 7, 10, or 17 days, you’ll be slimmer. And if your results are like so many others, you’ll feel a lot lighter and have an absurd amount of energy.



The beauty of the 17 Day Diet is that it works in 4 cycles, depending on how much weight you’d like to lose.

Cycle 1 is the initial 17 day period during which you give up all bread, rice, potatoes, pasta, baked goods, fruit, candy, cake, ice cream, and alcohol. It’s the strictest period, but also when the most rapid weight loss occurs. And it’s easier than you think. You won’t even miss carbs after a few days, because your body gets used to not relying on them. You get to eat unlimited amounts of certain proteins and vegetables. And you’ll supplement your daily diet with probiotics like yogurt and kefir, foods shown in research to help the body burn fat.

The great thing about Cycle 1 is that you can use it anytime: when you need to break a plateau, get back to your goal weight, fit into a smaller dress size for the weekend or a swimsuit for a cruise, anytime you want to accelerate your weight loss and do it safely. Cycle 1 is one of your best quick-weight loss resources.

During Cycle 2, you slowly begin to reintroduce certain carbs, such as legumes, whole grains, and starchy vegetables, along with lots of other foods. Weight loss continues, and still fairly rapidly. And now, you can drink a little wine, something most diets forbid.

On Cycle 3, you get to eat a huge of array of healthy foods: breads, more meats, more starches, and fun foods like low-carb frozen dessert treats. You ease off some of the strictness of the first 2 cycles, while still continuing to knock off pounds. Every 17 days you’re changing things up, so you never get bored. Every day is exciting, because you see the results on your scale or in your more loosely fitting clothes.

Cycle 4 is the maintenance period that, ideally, you stay on the rest of your life. It lets you stay at your new weight as long as you do two things: enjoy yourself on the weekend, and use your favorite cycle during the week. So, once you’re happy with your new svelte self, continue to enjoy occasional forbidden foods. Just do so carefully or you’ll find yourself back on a slippery slope to your prediet weight. If you fall off the wagon for a weekend or, say, on a vacation, don’t panic. Just jump back to Cycle 1 to quickly shave off any weight you gain.



Eliminating unhealthy foods from your system keeps them from making a beeline to your belly and elsewhere. Healthy foods do the opposite. The higher amounts of lean protein you eat on this diet, for example, boost your metabolism in a number of physiologically active ways. This diet is high in fiber, too, which is an appetite suppressant, a detoxifier, and a food component that ushers bad calories out of your system before they have time to camp out on your thighs. Then there is the addition of probiotics, now believed to keep fat formation in check.

Another reason that the 17 Day Diet works is because you’re changing your calorie count and the foods you eat. By varying these things, you keep your body and metabolism guessing. I call this . The scale is less likely to get stuck. The added bonus: You’ll never get bored. And it’s fun watching those pounds melt off. So, confusion is good!

But, more important, the 17 Day Diet works because it’s realistic and sustainable. Nothing derails a diet faster than distressing round-the-clock hunger pangs, or boredom. But the 17 Day Diet isn’t about depriving yourself of food or variety. I encourage you to eat until you are no longer hungry, even snack between meals, as long as you’re eating the right foods. That doesn’t mean just broccoli, either. Nuts, cheeses, and other delicious foods are permitted as you progress through the cycles. There are so many choices, too, that you’ll never get bored.



You’ve read this and you’re a believer, and you can’t wait to get started. To learn all the intricacies of how and why the diet works, you need to get the book, , and its other companion book, . If you can’t get to the bookstore right away, here’s an overview of the diet:

Activate (17 days) To reset your metabolism through a strategy that involves increasing and decreasing your caloric consumption to stimulate fat-burning, and to help prevent plateaus. Cycle 3:
Achieve (17 days) To develop good eating habits through the reintroduction of additional foods and move you closer to your goal weight. Cycle 4:
Arrive (ongoing) To keep you at your goal weight through a program of eating that lets you enjoy your favorite foods on weekends, while eating healthfully during the week.


For losing weight on , this cookbook is divided into three easy-to-digest sections:

• Cycle 1 Recipes and Cycle 1 17 Day Meal Plan

• Cycle 2 Recipes and Cycle 2 17 Day Meal Plan

• Cycle 3 Recipes and Cycle 3 17 Day Meal Plan

Each section features delicious breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and snacks that match the cycle you’re in. I show you how to use those recipes by giving you menu plans for each cycle. That’s a total of 51 daily menus to help you.

Follow these delicious meal plans, week by week. They will give you structure, which helps guard against unplanned eating, plus you can learn about some new foods and ways to prepare them. The meal plans are low in fat, high in fiber, packed with nutrition, and designed to trigger rapid weight loss. I strongly believe that the way you eat to control your weight must continue for the rest of your life. These meal plans can help you do that. They provide a lifelong foundation for a healthy, enjoyable, and satisfying way of eating.

Now that you’re acquainted with how the 17 Day Diet works in conjunction with this cookbook, it’s time to take action. People who have used this plan have told us they could not believe how effortless it was to lose weight and keep it off. Why? Because the 17 Day Diet is a way of life. Unlike your past dieting experiences, you’ll never need to quit. As long as you keep going, you’ll see results. Beginning in Cycle 1, you’ll start to shed unwanted pounds and renew your vitality.

I know you’ll enjoy what we’ve cooked up here. These are recipes that can satisfy your appetite and help you drop pounds. Each one has been created to help you succeed at getting your weight under control without skimping on the flavors you love.

I know you want meals that are quick and healthy. You want them to taste wonderful, you want them to help you lose weight, and you want them now! Seems like a tall order, but that’s what these recipes deliver, especially if you’re prepared. Just start with a cycle’s worth of meals, and do it. Having the right ingredients on hand, plus kitchen equipment that makes preparation easier, will make cooking quicker and more healthful.

Time-savers are built into each recipe, too. For example, they take advantage of healthy convenience foods available in supermarkets, such as boneless, skinless chicken breasts. All you have to do is apply the finishing touches. For side dishes, you’ll use quick-cooking staples such as washed greens and salad mixes, frozen fruits and vegetables, and quality convenience products, such as prepared salad dressings and low-calorie condiments.

Preparing the 17 Day Diet recipes requires no special equipment, although some appliances (suggested but not required) can help, and these are listed for you here. There are few meals that can’t be made leaner or healthier by using cooking methods such as broiling, steaming, baking, lightly stir-frying, microwaving, and sautéing in water or with vegetable cooking spray. With every new recipe you try, you will discover low-fat and low-carb cooking tips; healthy methods of food preparation; ways to cut the fat, sugar, calories, and cholesterol; and how to use fresh herbs and spices to add flavor. We also include important information on kitchen tools that can help you prepare healthful meals. You may already have a lot of the gear in your kitchen. The rest you should be able to pick up at any kitchenware or houseware store. Consider these tools to help you get your weight under control. The more weight-loss tools you have, the more successful you will be.

Now, the 17 Day Diet recipes. Enjoy!

Pots and Pans
Look for heavy pots and pans, preferably with nonstick coatings and tight-fitting lids. The nonstick coating can help you cut down the amount of oil or other fats you need to coat the pan, and it’ll make cleanup a lot easier. Saucepans: at least three (one 1-quart pan, one 2-quart pan, and one 3-quart pan) Skillets: two or three (one 7- and/or 8-inch skillet and one 12-inch skillet) Soup pot: one 5- or 6-quart pot

Utensils
Stocking your kitchen with the following utensils will make your culinary efforts easier and more enjoyable. You may even find that having a couple of sets of some items, such as wooden spoons and spatulas, is more convenient than having to wash the tools several times throughout the preparation of a dish or meal. Colander Cutting board Egg separator Garlic press Grater Kitchen scissors Spatulas Strainer Timer Whisks Wooden spoons

Other Useful Items
If you have the storage space in your kitchen, these additional items are less essential, but definitely helpful. Baking pans: at least one 13- x 9- x 2-inch pan; at least one 8- x 8- x 2-inch pan Muffin tin: one or two Baker’s rack: preferably a large, square one, for cooling bread and muffins. A rack permits the air to circulate, reducing sogginess. Casserole dishes: at least two (one 1½-quart dish and one 3-quart dish), with covers Mixing bowls: several sizes Slow cooker (such as a Crock-Pot): good for soups and lean cuts of meats Steamer rack: for cooking vegetables and reheating foods that do best with moist heat Wok: for stir-frying and steaming

You don't have to be a culinary icon to cook well, and this book by Lia Reyner proves it! I believe this is one of the best air frying guides out there because I already have a great number of air fryer cookbooks and mostly all of them are really not the sort of thing I'm interested in. They are close but they are just not right - having illustrations they intimidate me with all the overlapping directions and basically, I mess up the whole meal instead of cooking it step by step. This book is a completely different story. It's a self-made success in the kitchen you can reach only by following the thorough directions Lia is generous enough to offer. Desserts chapter is my favorite one, I must confess. I mean, why not when you face all the pies, cakes, doughnuts, cookies, cream, puddings, bread and keep on wondering how is that even possible to try all of it without gaining any weight.

Award-winning celebrity chef Rocco DiSpirito changed his life and his health-without giving up the foods he loves or the flavor. He has lost more than 20 pounds, participated in dozens of triathlons, and-after an inspirational role as a guest chef on The Biggest Loser-changed his own diet and the caloric content of classic dishes on a larger scale. In the Now Eat This!

Now readers can eat more and weigh less-it's never been so easy!",390959,"From Publishers Weekly
A follow-up to the author's popular Now Eat This! cookbook, this volume offers an uncomplicated plan for cutting calories and losing weight, in two sections. The first explains how the diet works and how it's possible to eat tasty foods made from healthier ingredients, offers basic advice about exercise, and delineates a ""14 Day Fast Track Plan"" for kick-starting weight loss by eating 1,400 calories per day (1,200 for women). The second section delivers 75 recipes designed to fit into that low-cal meal plan. They're color-coded by calorie counts so it's easy to pick recipes to fit into a day's overall total. Breakfast choices include a sunrise sandwich with eggs-egg substitute, actually-and Canadian bacon on a whole-wheat English muffin for 279 calories. Bacon appears again in DiSpiritio's version of the BLT, a bacon, lettuce, and tomato roll with 245 calories, thanks to the use of fat-free mayo and a touch of crumbled bacon instead of several bacon strips per sandwich. Spicy-sweet linguine alla vodka gets its creaminess from 2% Greek yogurt and clocks in at 307 calories per serving. There are desserts, too, like red velvet chocolate squares in which beets lend moisture, and agave nectar instead of sugar serves as sweetener. The recipes are mostly super (more like assembling ingredients than cooking) and the prose is straightforward (if a little choppy and repetitive)-meaning just about anyone who wants to should be able to follow this plan and lighten up mealtimes.

-Beautiful color photos for every dish

The millennial kosher kitchen is one in which food is reinvented and reimagined in new and exciting ways. It includes ingredients that are healthier, fresher, and more vibrant than ever before. Yesterday's margarine is today's coconut oil, bone broth is the new chicken soup, and the onion soup mix of our youth is replaced with umami-rich porcini mushroom powder.
Today, kosher food is spicier and bolder than the food we grew up eating. There's an emphasis on fresh and seasonal ingredients, less processed foods, and healthier nondairy alternatives. Modern kosher food reinterprets and reinvents tradition, while still staying true to our heritage. It's food that's influenced by cultural cuisine and not limited to, but inspired by, kosher guidelines.

Today the term encompasses a vast range of preparations, most of which involve salting, cooking, smoking, and drying. In addition to providing classic recipes for sausages, terrines, and pâtés, Michael Ruhlman and Brian Polcyn expand the definition to include anything preserved or prepared ahead such as Mediterranean olive and vegetable rillettes, duck confit, and pickles and sauerkraut. Ruhlman, coauthor of The French Laundry Cookbook, and Polcyn, an expert charcuterie instructor at Schoolcraft College in Livonia, Michigan, present 125 recipes that are both intriguing to professionals and accessible to home cooks, including salted, airdried ham; Maryland crab, scallop, and saffron terrine; Da Bomb breakfast sausage; mortadella and soppressata; and even spicy smoked almonds. 50 line drawings",204317,"From Publishers Weekly
Starred Review. Without the faintest hint of apology, Ruhlman and Polcyn present an arsenal of recipes that take hours, and sometimes days, to prepare; are loaded with fat; and, if ill-prepared, can lead to botulism. The result is one of the most intriguing and important cookbooks published this year. Ruhlman (The Soul of a Chef) is a food poet, and the pig is his muse. On witnessing a plate of cold cuts in Italy, he is awed by ""the way the sunlight hit the fat of the dried meats, the way it glistened, the beauty of the meat."" He relates and refines the work of Polcyn, a chef-instructor at a college in Livonia, Mich., who butchers a whole hog ""every couple weeks for his students."" Together, they make holy the art of stuffing a sausage, the brining of a corned beef and the poaching of a salted meat in its own fat. An extensive chapter on pâtés and terrines is entitled ""The Cinderella Meat Loaf"" and runs the gamut from exotic Venison Terrine with Dried Cherries to hearty English Pork Pie with a crust made from both lard and butter. And while there's no shortage of lyricism, science plays an equally important role. Everyone knows salt is a preservative, for example, but here we learn exactly how it does its job. And a section on safety issues weighs the dangers of nitrites and explains the difference between good white mold and the dangerous, green, fuzzy stuff. Line drawings.

Growing up in a family where everyone came together at the dinner table, Elizabeth Hasselbeck savored the signature meatball, lasagna, and ziti dishes of her grandmother and great-grandmother, and the pierogies of her father’s heritage. But a decade ago, the Emmy Award–winning co-host of The View, New York Times bestselling author, and mother of three was diagnosed with celiac disease, and the family recipes she grew up with suddenly became strictly off-limits. Or so she thought.
 
Getting rid of gluten, however, doesn’t have to mean giving up taste. Deliciously G-Free combines Hasselbeck’s knowledge for healthy living and passion for tasty food to bring you 100 delectable, easy-to-make, and family-friendly gluten free recipes. By adding a variety of other ingredients to the fridge and pantry, she’s perfected scrumptious gluten free versions of old standards and new creations that would make her relatives proud, including
 
• Breakfasts to Remember: Fried Egg Sandwich with Chipotle Mayo, Coconut Raspberry Muffins, French Toast with Caramel Rum Bananas, Blueberry Waffles, and Frittata
• All-Star Appetizers: Pork Pot Stickers, Stuffed Mushrooms, Smoked Salmon on Corn Fritters, Crab Cakes with Homemade Tartar Sauce, and Hot Artichoke Dip
• Mouthwatering Main Meals: Excellent Enchiladas with Quinoa Cornbread, Mac and Cheese, Lasagna, Veggie Pad Thai, Chimichurri Flank Steak and Grilled Asparagus, and Buttermilk Chicken
• Deliciously Irresistible Desserts:  Chocolate Devil’s Food Cupcakes, Blueberry-Raspberry Cobbler, Chocolate Chip Cookies, Tiramisu, Yellow Birthday Cake, and Double Chocolate Brownies
 
Loaded with gorgeous color photos, Deliciously G-Free also satisfies your taste buds with ideas for gourmet entertaining, kid-friendly concoctions, cool-weather comfort foods, and “Get Fit” gluten free recipes. Plus, Hasselbeck opens up about her own gluten free journey—from getting diagnosed to getting her family on board—and shares tips for how to stock your kitchen, prevent cross-contamination, and whip up gluten free flour mixes that literally take the cake.
 
Looking great and feeling good from the inside out is just one Deliciously G-Free meal away!

|About the author
Melissa Joulwan is the author of the best-selling Well Fed cookbook series and the award-winning blog MelJoulwan.com, where she writes about her triumphs and failures in the gym, in the kitchen, and in life. Her newest cookbook is Well Fed Weeknights: Complete Paleo Meals in 45 Minutes Or Less.

After a lifetime of yo-yo dieting and food as the enemy, Melissa found the paleo diet in 2009 and has been happily following it ever since. That year, she also underwent a thyroidectomy. In the aftermath of the surgery and recovery, she became particularly interested in how diet affects hormones, body composition, mood, and motivation. These days, Melissa's workouts are just as likely to include yoga and meditation as lifting heavy things and sprinting to stay ahead of the stopwatch.

Her first cookbook Well Fed appeared on the Wall Street Journal best sellers list, and Well Fed 2 was named one of the best books of 2013 by Amazon.com and was a Washington Post best seller. Melissa is the author of the recipes in the New York Times bestselling book It Starts With Food by Melissa and Dallas Hartwig. She writes a column for Paleo Magazine and her recipes have been featured in print in Low Sugar Living, Inspire Health, and Where Women Cook, and online at Buzzfeed.com, FoodNetwork.com, Nylon.com, PopSugar.com, and Men's Journal. She has been a featured chef for U.S. Wellness Meats and Lava Lake Lamb, as well as an instructor at Whole Foods.

Melissa, her husband David, and their cat Smudge are all currently living in Prague, Czech Republic where they're learning to adapt Czech and European cuisine to fit the paleo framework.",,"['well fed', 'melissa joulwan', 'fed books', 'stir fry', 'fed series', 'paleo cookbook', 'melissa joulwan', 'easy to follow', 'pages are falling', 'every recipe', 'great recipes', 'fed weeknights', 'put together', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Long before Padma Lakshmi ever stepped onto a television set, she learned that how we eat is an extension of how we love, how we comfort, how we forge a sense of home - and how we taste the world as we navigate our way through it. Shuttling between continents as a child, she lived a life of dislocation that would become habit as an adult, never quite at home in the world. And yet, through all her travels, her favorite food remained the simple rice she first ate sitting on the cool floor of her grandmother's kitchen in South India.
Poignant and surprising, Love, Loss, and What We Ate is Lakshmi's extraordinary account of her journey from that humble kitchen, ruled by ferocious and unforgettable women, to the judges' table of Top Chef and beyond. It chronicles the fierce devotion of the remarkable people who shaped her along the way, from her headstrong mother, who flouted conservative Indian convention to make a life in New York, to her Brahmin grandfather - a brilliant engineer with an irrepressible sweet tooth - to the man seemingly wrong for her in every way who proved to be her truest ally. A memoir rich with sensual prose and punctuated with evocative recipes, it is alive with the scents, tastes, and textures of a life that spans complex geographies both internal and external.

Higgins, Dennis Lehane (Introduction)",4.2,297,9.99,14.71,,"The classic novel from ""America's best crime novelist"" (Time), with a new introduction by Dennis Lehane
George V. Higgins's seminal crime novel is a down-and-dirty tale of thieves, mobsters, and cops on the mean streets of Boston. When small-time gunrunner Eddie Coyle is convicted on a felony, he's looking at three years in the pen--that is, unless he sells out one of his big-fish clients to the DA. But which of the many hoods, gunmen, and executioners whom he calls his friends should he send up the river? Told almost entirely in crackling dialogue by a vivid cast of lowlifes and detectives, The Friends of Eddie Coyle is one of the greatest crime novels ever written.
“The best crime novel ever written--makes The Maltese Falcon read like Nancy Drew.” -- Elmore Leonard",42392,"Review
“Simultaneously a brilliant thriller and a cold and convincing business prospectus of felony--a profession that traps both sides, gunmen and policemen, into ceaseless compulsory degradation.” ―The New Yorker
“Chilling . . . The most penetrating glimpse yet into what seems the real world of crime. . . . Positively reeking with authenticity.” ―The New York Times Book Review
“Truly a bravura performance. Higgins is a master of colorful street language heard around Boston. Throughout the novel, without quaintness or self-parody, he is able to sustain long arias of criminal shoptalk. . . . A sophisticated thriller.” ―Time
“Weighed and calibrated like the barrel of a pistol. The fact that he's writing about crooks is crucial in some ways, incidental in others. The real subjects here are life's futility and its bleak humor… Elmore Leonard learned from this novel, likewise David Mamet and of course Quentin Tarantino, who saw the narrative virtue in marrying violence to comedies of manners…. Higgins took the tough-guy novel into areas of demented anthropology and re-created a genre.” ―Richard Rayner, Los Angeles Times
“Rings true as a police siren.” ―The Boston Globe
“The best crime novel ever written--makes The Maltese Falcon read like Nancy Drew.” ―Elmore Leonard
“First-rate, absolutely convincing, enormously readable.” ―The Christian Science Monitor

It began in Ireland in the mid 1700s. The water in Ireland, indeed throughout Europe, was famously undrinkable, and the gin and whiskey that took its place devastated civil society. It was a disease ridden, starvation-plagued, alcoholic age, and Christians like Arthur Guinness—as well as monks and even evangelical churches—brewed beer that provided a healthier alternative to the poisonous waters and liquors of the times. This is where the Guinness tale began. Now, 250 years and over 150 countries later, Guinness is a global brand, one of the most consumed beverages in the world. The tale that unfolds during those two and a half centuries has power to thrill audiences today: the generational drama, business adventure, industrial and social reforms, deep-felt faith, and the noble beer itself.

Brackett, Mary Brackett,",4.6,294,16.17,20.73,,"With more than two hundred straightforward, nutrient-dense, and appealing recipes, The Heal Your Gut Cookbook was created by GAPS Diet experts Hilary Boynton and Mary G. Brackett to help heal your gut and to manage the illnesses that stem from it.
Developed by pioneering British MD Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride, who provides the book’s Foreword, Gut and Psychology Syndrome (GAPS) refers to disorders, including ADD/ADHD, autism, addictions, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, stemming from or exacerbated by leaky gut and dysbiosis. GAPS also refers to chronic gut-related physical conditions, including celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes type one, and Crohn’s disease, as well as asthma, eczema, allergies, thyroid disorders, and more. An evolution of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet, the GAPS Diet will appeal to followers of the Paleo Diet, who are still struggling for optimum health, as well as anyone interested in the health benefits of fermentation or the Weston A. Price approach to nutrition.
In The Heal Your Gut Cookbook, readers will learn about the key cooking techniques and ingredients that form the backbone of the GAPS Diet: working with stocks and broths, soaking nuts and seeds, using coconut, and culturing raw dairy. The authors offer encouraging, real-life perspectives on the life-changing improvements to the health of their families by following this challenging, but powerful, diet.
The GAPS Diet is designed to restore the balance between beneficial and pathogenic intestinal bacteria and seal the gut through the elimination of grains, processed foods, and refined sugars and the carefully sequenced reintroduction of nutrient-dense foods, including bone broths, raw cultured dairy, certain fermented vegetables, organic pastured eggs, organ meats, and more.
The Heal Your Gut Cookbook is a must-have if you are following the GAPS Diet, considering the GAPS Diet, or simply looking to improve your digestive health and―by extension―your physical and mental well-being.",16891,"Review
Library Journal-
""Mind the GAPS! GAPS stands for either 'Gut and Psychology Syndrome’ or 'Gut and Physiology Syndrome.’ In either case, the GAPS diet is meant to address mental health and physical issues that arise from “leaky gut” and abnormal stomach bacteria. This combination cookbook and guide provides a road map and tools for those attempting to improve their intestinal biome. Beginning with a strict introductory program that also serves as an allergen screening tool, readers who choose to follow certified holistic health counselor Boynton and Brackett’s program start with a severely limited diet and then add specific food categories every few days for about a month. After this initial period, the authors recommend a less restrictive (but still fairly limiting) diet to be followed for at least two years. Meat, eggs, and coconut products are heavily featured, so cholesterol may be an issue for some. ­VERDICT Not for the fainthearted, this serious dietary regime will nonetheless be embraced by those who feel they have not been helped by other medical solutions. Purchase where there is interest.”


“More than half of American children are currently diagnosed with a chronic illness, and much of that statistic can be attributed to a long list of damaging exposures (from antibiotics to GMOs) that have destroyed the health of the American gut. For all the damage we have done to our gut and immune health, there is hope. Healing the gut through nutrient-dense, restorative diets like the GAPS Diet is absolutely foundational to recovery. Recovery is within reach and The Heal Your Gut Cookbook is a terrific companion for that journey.”--Beth Lambert, author, A Compromised Generation: The Epidemic of Chronic Illness in America’s Children, executive director, Epidemic Answers, and executive producer, The Canary Kids Project

* overcome cravings

Teenagers like what they like, and they will only eat what they like. But instead of causing mealtime strife, now they can learn to cook those foods themselves. With over 75 delicious recipes for meals at all times of the day—breakfast, snacks, sides, dinners, and dessert, too—Teens Cook is a guide to everything teenagers (and tweens) need to learn about conquering the kitchen without accidentally setting the house on fire. Written by teens and for teens in easy-to-follow instructions, authors Megan and Jill Carle give young readers advice on how to maneuver their kitchen in a language they’ll understand (and actually listen to). The Carle sisters pass on their knowledge of how to decipher culinary vocabulary, understand kitchen chemistry (why stuff goes right and wrong when cooking), adapt recipes to certain dietary restrictions (like vegetarianism), and avoid all sorts of possible kitchen disasters.

Teens Cook is not only a fantastic teen gift—it’s the perfect cookbook to inspire young adults to take interest in their diets, and empower them to try a new and tasty hobby.",8129,"From School Library Journal
Grade 7 Up–Sisters Megan and Jill Carle love to cook, both from recipes and experimenting with what's on hand. When they eat something they love in a restaurant, they try to re-create it at home. If they find a complicated recipe, they fearlessly ""take shortcuts that would probably give a chef hives."" The result of their culinary passion is this appealing mix of 85 diverse recipes ranging from comfort food to sushi. The six sections include traditional American cuisine, as well as recipes for German, Chinese, and Mexican dishes. Basic cooking instruction is incorporated into the recipes themselves as well as in the sidebars sprinkled liberally throughout. The gently wry introductions for each recipe offer keen glimpses into the siblings' personalities and relationship, adding to the intimacy and warmth of this cookbook. Megan, a vegetarian, offers advice on adapting many of the recipes to her diet. ""Kitchen Disasters"" offer amusing accounts of mistakes made by the Carles or their relatives, complete with explanations of exactly why things went awry. The clear instructions and striking, full-color photos will equip teen chefs to undertake their own adventures, but the reliance on butter, cream, mayonnaise, cheese, and other high-fat ingredients is a drawback for those seeking a healthy diet. Evelyn Raab's Clueless in the Kitchen (Firefly, 1998) is a far more extensive collection of recipes that also includes more basic information about equipment, shopping, and food preparation.–Joyce Adams Burner, Hillcrest Library, Prairie Village, KS

Perhaps more responsible than anyone for the revolution in the way we eat, cook, and think about food, Alice Waters has “single-handedly chang[ed] the American palate” according to the New York Times. Her simple but inventive dishes focus on a passion for flavor and a reverence for locally produced, seasonal foods.

With an essential repertoire of timeless, approachable recipes chosen to enhance and showcase great ingredients, The Art of Simple Food is an indispensable resource for home cooks. Here you will find Alice’s philosophy on everything from stocking your kitchen, to mastering fundamentals and preparing delicious, seasonal inspired meals all year long. Always true to her philosophy that a perfect meal is one that’s balanced in texture, color, and flavor, Waters helps us embrace the seasons’ bounty and make the best choices when selecting ingredients. Fill your market basket with pristine produce, healthful grains, and responsibly raised meat, poultry, and seafood, then embark on a voyage of culinary rediscovery that reminds us that the most gratifying dish is often the least complex.",22975,"Amazon.com Review
Do we really need more recipes for beef stew, polenta, and ratatouille? If they're the work of famed restaurateur and ""food activist"" Alice Waters, undoubtedly. In The Art of Simple Food, Waters offers 200-plus recipes for these and other simple but savory dishes, like Spicy Cauliflower Soup, Fava Bean Purée, and Braised Chicken Legs, as well as dessert formulas for the likes of Nectarine and Blueberry Crisp and Tangerine Ice. In addition, readers learn (or become reacquainted with) the Waters mantra: eat locally and sustainably; eat seasonally; shop at farmers markets. These are the rules by which she approaches food and cooking, and hopes we will too. Organized largely by techniques, the book is a kind of primer, designed to free readers from recipe reliance.
Some readers may look askance at advice that they search out sources for locally produced food, for example, given the everyday exigencies of shopping and getting meals on the table. Yet it is precisely the need to ""remake"" our relationship to food that, Waters contends, determines the ultimate success of all our cooking and dining, not to mention our health and that of the planet. This relatively small book has a large message, and good everyday recipes to back it up. --Arthur Boehm
From Publishers Weekly
Starred Review. The delicious dishes described in the latest cookbook from Chez Panisse founder Waters, such as a four-ingredient Soda Bread and Cauliflower Salad with Olives and Capers, are simple indeed, though the book's structure is complex, if intuitive. After a useful discussion of ingredients and equipment come chapters on techniques, such as making broth and soup. Each of these includes three or four recipes that rely on the technique described, which can lead to repetition (still preferable to a lack of guidance): a chapter on roasting contains two pages of instructions on roasting a chicken (including a hint to salt it a day in advance for juicy results), followed by a recipe for Roast Chicken that is simply an abbreviated version of those two pages. The final third of the book divides many more recipes traditionally into salads, pasta and so forth. Waters taps an almost endless supply of ideas for appealing and fresh yet low-stress dishes: Zucchini Ragout with Bacon and Tomato, Onion Custard Pie, Chocolate Crackle Cookies with almonds and a little brandy. Whether explaining why salting food properly is key or describing the steps to creating the ideal Grilled Cheese Sandwich, she continues to prove herself one of our best modern-day food writers.

The only thing ""gonzo gastronome"" and internationally bestselling author Anthony Bourdain loves as much as cooking is traveling. Inspired by the question, ""What would be the perfect meal?,"" Tony sets out on a quest for his culinary holy grail, and in the process turns the notion of ""perfection"" inside out. From California to Cambodia, A Cooks' Tour chronicles the unpredictable adventures of America's boldest and bravest chef.
Fans of Bourdain will find much to love in revisting this classic culinary and travel memoir.",21965,"Amazon.com Review
A Cook's Tour is the written record of Anthony Bourdain's travels around the world in his search for the perfect meal. All too conscious of the state of his 44-year-old knees after a working life standing at restaurant stoves, but with the unlooked-for jackpot of Kitchen Confidential as collateral, Mr. Bourdain evidently concluded he needed a bit more wind under his wings.
The idea of ""perfect meal"" in this context is to be taken to mean not necessarily the most upscale, chi-chi, three-star dining experience, but the ideal combination of food, atmosphere, and company. This would take in fishing villages in Vietnam, bars in Cambodia, and Tuareg camps in Morocco (roasted sheep's testicle, as it happens); it would stretch to smoked fish and sauna in the frozen Russian countryside and the French Laundry in California's Napa Valley. It would mean exquisitely refined kaiseki rituals in Japan after yakitori with drunken salarymen. Deep-fried Mars Bars in Glasgow and Gordon Ramsay in London. The still-beating heart of a cobra in Saigon. Drink. Danger. Guns. All with a TV crew in tow for the accompanying series--22 episodes of video gold, we are assured, featuring many don't-try-this-at-home shots of the author in gastric distress or crawling into yet another storm drain at four in the morning.
You are unlikely to lay your hands on a more hectically, strenuously entertaining book for some time. Our hero eats and swashbuckles round the globe with perfect-pitch attitude and liberal use of judiciously placed profanities. Bourdain can write. His timing is great. He is very funny and is under no illusions whatsoever about himself or anyone else. But most of all, he is a chef who got himself out of his kitchen and found, all over the world, people who understand that eating well is the foundation of harmonious living. --Robin Davidson, Amazon.co.uk
From Publishers Weekly
In this paperback reprint, swashbuckling chef Anthony Bourdain, author of the bestselling Kitchen Confidential (which famously warned restaurant-goers against ordering fish on Mondays), travels where few foodies have thought to travel before in search of the perfect meal: the Sputnik-era kitchen of a ""less-than-diminutive"" St. Petersburg matron, the provincial farmhouse of a Portuguese pig-slaughterer and the middle of the Moroccan desert, where he dines on ""crispy, veiny"" lamb testicles. Searching for the ""perfect meal,"" Bourdain writes with humor and intelligence, describing meals of boudin noir and Vietnamese hot vin lon (""essentially a soft-boiled duck embryo"") and 'fessing up to a few nights of over-indulgence (""I felt like I'd awakened under a collapsed building,"" he writes of a night in San Sebastian hopping from tapas bar to tapas bar). Goat's head soup, lemongrass tripe, and pork-blood cake all make appearances, as does less exotic fare, such as French fries and Mars bars (deep fried, but still). In between meals, Bourdain lets his readers in on the surprises and fears of a well-fed American voyaging to far-off, frugal places, where every part of an animal that can be eaten must be eaten, and the need to preserve food has fueled culinary innovation for centuries. He also reminds his audience of the connections between food and land and human toil, which, in these sterilized days of pre-wrapped sausages, is all too easy to forget.

Chicken Parmesan without dredging and frying. Fruit crisp on the stovetop. The secret to cooking fast is cooking smart—choosing and preparing fresh ingredients efficiently.

In How to Cook Everything Fast, Mark Bittman provides a game plan for becoming a better, more intuitive cook while you wake up your weekly meal routine with 2,000 main dishes and accompaniments that are simple to make, globally inspired, and bursting with flavor.

How to Cook Everything Fast is a book of kitchen innovations. Time management— the essential principle of fast cooking— is woven into revolutionary recipes that do the thinking for you. You’ll learn how to take advantage of downtime to prepare vegetables while a soup simmers or toast croutons while whisking a dressing. Just cook as you read—and let the recipes guide you quickly and easily toward a delicious result.

Bittman overhauls hundreds of classics through clever (even unorthodox) use of equipment and techniques—encouraging what he calls “naturally fast cooking”—and the results are revelatory.
There are standouts like Cheddar Waffles with Bacon Maple Syrup (bold flavors in less time); Charred Brussels Sprout Salad with Walnuts and Gorgonzola (the food processor streamlines chopping); Spaghetti and Drop Meatballs with Tomato Sauce (no rolling or shaping); and Apple Crumble Under the Broiler (almost instant dessert gratification).
Throughout, Bittman’s commonsense advice and plentiful variations provide cooks with freedom and flexibility, with tips for squeezing in further shortcuts, streamlined kitchen notes, and illustrations to help you prep faster or cook without a recipe.

How to Cook Everything Fast puts time on your side and makes a lifetime of homemade meals an exciting and delicious reality.",27303,"Review

By about six months, when babies can sit up unassisted, grab things, and munch on them, they are ready to join the family at the kitchen table and discover real, solid food for themselves.
Baby-led weaning sets the stage for healthy eating habits in the years ahead by helping babies learn to feed themselves, to gauge appetite, and to love a variety of nutritious foods. Now, with The Baby-Led Weaning Cookbook, cooking family meals that your little one can share will be a cinch. Gill Rapley and Tracey Murkett—coauthors of Baby-Led Weaning, the book that started the movement—collect 130 recipes perfectly suited for baby-led weaning, as well as:
• Straightforward advice on which foods to start with
• Essential at-a-glance information on nutrition and food safety
• Healthy ideas for quick snacks, delicious desserts, and meals for the whole family
• Anecdotes and quotes from parents who follow baby-led weaning

Selected by the New York Times as a Notable Cookbook of 2011, by USA Today as a Best Holiday Gift “For the Foodie,” and by More.com as one of their Best Cookbooks of the Year.

WHEN BLOGGER JENNIFER REESE LOST HER JOB, SHE BEGAN A SERIES OF FOOD-RELATED EXPERIMENTS. Economizing by making her own peanut butter, pita bread, and yogurt, she found that “doing it yourself” doesn’t always cost less or taste better. In fact, she found that the joys of making some foods from scratch— marshmallows, hot dog buns, and hummus—can be augmented by buying certain ready-made foods—butter, ketchup, and hamburger buns. Tired? Buy your mayonnaise. Inspired? Make it.

With Reese’s fresh voice and delightful humor, Make the Bread, Buy the Butter has 120 recipes with eminently practical yet deliciously fun “make or buy” recommendations. Her tales include living with a backyard full of cheerful chickens, muttering ducks, and adorable baby goats; countertops laden with lacto-fermenting pickles; and closets full of mellowing cheeses. Here’s the full picture of what is involved in a truly homemade life and how to get the most out of your time in the kitchen—with the good news that you shouldn’t try to make everything yourself.",108849,"Review
“In a time when the pressure’s on to be green, organic and homemade, food fans and cooks will appreciate a book that encourages balance: Make your own hummus, yogurt and dill pickles, but buy sashimi, baguettes and corn dogs.” Author: USA TODAY

“A great read for cooks afflicted by curiosity about the do-it-yourself movement in food. Ms. Reese goes beyond jam and chutney into pasta, pastrami and graham crackers. Even her failed experiments, like homemade hot dogs, are entertaining.” –New York Times

""From hot dog buns to Pop-Tarts, she reveals whether it's better to buy it or make it, accounting for the cost, hassle and rate of success. Happily, she dispenses this practical know-how with a crackling sense of humor, making this book a fun read. The scope and utility of this book make it worthy of space in your collection, especially this time of year when you're looking for fast and interesting gifts to make in the kitchen. Plus Reese's honesty is refreshing and inspiring; she goes from a hilarious review of the 1970s Earth-mother bible ""Laurel's Kitchen"" to making a modern-day case for baking."" Author: The Oregonian

""Now that Michael Pollan has made us all aspire to be politically correct foodies, a certain angst has cast its shadow over the average American home. One of the big issues is, should I make my own food and thus assure myself that it contains only the healthiest and freshest of ingredients, or is it more practical to just buy it somewhere. Reese tackles this question for a number of common foods and she writes in a witty, conversational style that wins you over right from the start."" Author: Sacramento Bee

""I'm always interested in what Jennifer says about food, and about how to retain the pleasure of eating it in an increasingly confusing world. Plus, she's convinced me to try making my own Camembert. Jennifer's is a journey I'm thrilled to embark upon."" Author: Julie Powell, author of Julie and Julia

“I knew this important, original, and necessary book would be informative—and it is, very. What I didn't expect: pure entertainment in an original, fresh voice that will make readers feel they have a smart new best friend. I lapped this up in one sitting, learned a bunch, laughed out loud - and am about to try several of the recipes. You nailed it, Jennifer Reese!” Author: Mollie Katzen, author of Moosewood Cookbook

""Here is a book that is going to take a treasured place in my kitchen bookrack. Part memoir, part Consumer-Reports-style testing, this book is chock-full of recipes and good advice in the kitchen. There are a few things Jennifer Reese does in this book that make it particularly indispensable: before each recipe, she tells her story of why she wanted to tackle it. Her recipes are easy-to-follow, and often include diagrams and pictures to get through the more difficult parts. I would highly recommend this book if you are thinking about embarking on the adventure that is backyard chicken raising. Here, Reese offers a humane and very funny look at what that project brought to her family. I would recommend this book if you, like me, spend a lot of time thinking about what goes into your body and wondering where did so many of these so-called ""conveniences"" come from, and are they really worth it? I've suspected making my own bread is the way to go for a long time, but in this book, Jennifer Reese cements it for me. Her recipes are tried-and-true, her reasoning makes sense to me, and her personality makes it believable. Buy this book, give it to a friend, make these recipes and watch your world get a little better."" Author: The Tattered Cover

“Her experiences led her to create a great blog, , and this awesome book. She’s very sarcastic, which makes me happy. Jennifer tells it like it is, from a simple bread recipe to raising chickens, and breaks everything down by price, reward, and hassle factor."" Author: TrueFoodMovement.com

""I loved this book. In her inspiring and hilarious voice, Reese reminds me why I actually should take the time to make from scratch things that I buy and giving me a pass on those things that I really don't want to make myself anyway. I laughed out loud."" Author: Carla Hall, Top Chef All Star, Co-host on The Chew, and founder, Alchemy by Carla Hall

There's so much confusion about what to eat. Are you jumping from diet to diet and nothing seems to work? Are you sick of seeing contradictory health advice from experts? Just like the tobacco industry lied to us about the dangers of cigarettes, the same untruths, cover-ups, and deceptive practices are occurring in the food industry. Vani Hari, aka The Food Babe, blows the lid off the lies we've been fed about the food we eat--lies about its nutrient value, effects on our health, label information, and even the very science we base our food choices on. You'll discover:

  •  How nutrition research is manipulated by food company funded experts

  •  How to spot fake news generated by Big Food

  •  The tricks food companies use to make their food addictive

  •  Why labels like ""all natural"" and ""non-GMO"" aren't what they seem and how to identify the healthiest food

  •  Food marketing hoaxes that persuade us into buying junk food disguised as health food

Vani guides you through a 48-hour Toxin Takedown to rid your pantry, and your body, of harmful chemicals--a quick and easy plan that anyone can do. A blueprint for living your life without preservatives, artificial sweeteners, additives, food dyes, or fillers, eating foods that truly nourish you and support your health, Feeding You Lies is the first step on a new path of truth in eating--and a journey to your best health ever.",19631,"Review
“There are 3,000 food additives in our food supply, many of which have not been tested for safety, and the average American consumes three to five pounds of these chemicals a year. In Feeding You Lies, Vani Hari pulls back the veil of deception by the food industry, scientists, and the media designed to manipulate us and ignore the unnecessary harms in our food supply. The deep investigation of the actions of the media, food companies, and science to suppress the truth will shock you, make you stop and consider what you put in your mouth, as well as empower you with the tools and strategies to protect yourself from bad foods and lies. If you eat, read this book.”
— Mark Hyman, M.D., #1 New York Times best-selling author of Food: What the Heck Should I Eat? and director, Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine

“A tangled web of deception is unraveled in this provocative page-turner! My eyes are now wide open thanks to Vani’s tireless investigative work to expose the truth about the food we eat.”
— Lewis Howes, New York Times best-selling author of The School of Greatness

“With all the wrongdoings exposed in this book, it’s no wonder that so many are confused about what to eat! You’ll never walk into a grocery store with the same outlook after learning the revealing information presented in this thoughtful read.”
— Frank Lipman, M.D., New York Times best-selling author of The New Health Rules and How to Be Well

“Our food is making many of us fat, sick, and miserable; but it’s making certain companies billions of dollars. To us, the fact that disease rates are skyrocketing is a matter of life or death; but to them, it’s just a PR problem. This magnificent book by the courageous and brilliant food activist Vani Hari shows you how to see through the lies, how to know the truth about what you are eating, and how to feed yourself and your family foods that will truly nourish your body, your mind, and your spirit.”
— , co-founder and president of Food Revolution Network and best-selling author of 

“The tobacco industry survived for decades by marketing ‘doubt as our product.’ Big Food is following in their footsteps. I am grateful to Vani Hari for exposing the abuse of trust and the descending health of the public at the hands of Big Food. Her simple Three Question Detox is a platform to upgrade the health of your family. Everyone should read this book.”

Featured Recipe from The Little Paris Kitchen: Canard à l’Orangina (Duck with fizzy orange)
Serves 4 as a main
When I was invited to a dinner hosted by Chef Jean-François Piège, he described how his previous elaborate style of cooking at the Hôtel de Crillon had evolved into something a lot more simple and homely at his current restaurant in the Hôtel Thoumieux. He told an amusing story of how his wife wanted duck à l’orange for Sunday supper and all he could find at his local corner shop was Orangina, so he used it to make a sauce for the duck. I’m not sure exactly how he made his canard à l’Orangina, but here’s my version. A simple watercress or wild arugula salad works well with this dish.
For the Marinade:
finely grated zest and juice of 1 orange
1 tbsp olive oil
½ tsp ground cumin
1 tsp salt

A culinary compendium packed with more than 200 foolproof recipes for the best baked goods, Martha Stewart’s Baking Handbook takes readers by the hand and guides them through the process of creating an irresistible variety of cakes, cookies, pies, tarts, breads, and much more.

This essential addition to every cook’s library is rich with tips, techniques, and the mouthwatering and stunning recipes for which Martha Stewart is so well known. Covering a delectable array of topics from simple to sophisticated, including biscuits, muffins, scones, cookies, layer cakes, specialty cakes, sweet and savory pies and tarts, and pastries and breads, she provides a dazzlingly delicious yet crystal-clear, vividly illustrated repertoire of recipes. There are cakes that are elegant enough for formal occasions, such as showers, weddings, and dinner parties, and basic favorites meant to be enjoyed every day and then passed down through the generations. Every chapter includes indispensable visual equipment glossaries and features vital make-ahead information and storage techniques. Organized for maximum clarity and practicality, the handbook also offers step-by-step how-to photographs that demystify even the most complex and nuanced techniques. These culinary building blocks will turn good bakers into great bakers, and make great bakers even better.

Filled with time-honored classics, such as Marble Cake with White-Chocolate Glaze, Apple Pie, Challah, Baba au Rhum, and Croissants, as well as lots of new surprises, Martha Stewart’s Baking Handbook will be reached for again and again, no matter the season or occasion.


“Here, you will find the recipes and how-tos for the popovers you dream about, and for the simple crumb cake that you always want to whip up on Sunday morning, and for the double-chocolate brownie cookies that will make you a bigger hero with the after-school crowd, and for the citrus bars that you could only find in that little bakery that’s no longer under the same management. . . . Baking offers comfort and joy and something tangible to taste and savor. We all hope that these recipes provide you with years of pleasure.” —Martha Stewart",53163,"Amazon.com Review
Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook presents the doyenne of the Better Way in tip-top form. Or rather, it offers the work of a dedicated team who, under Stewart's stewardship, has devised over 200 baking recipes for both savory and sweet treats, ranging from the traditional likes of buttermilk biscuits, gingersnaps, blueberry pie, bagels, and chocolate angel food cake, to the more novel pleasures of Sausage and Feta Hand Pies, Cherry Fragipane Gallete, Carrot-Ginger Cupcakes, and even the buttery-sugary to-die-for yeasted pastry called kouign amans. Also present and accounted-for are Stewartian showpieces like Mocha-Pistachio Wedding Cake.
The greatest virtue of the book, apart from the clarity of its recipes, lies in its organization: the chapters, which cover all baking stops, begin with relevant tips, followed by notes on equipment and techniques, all photo-illustrated. These set-ups supply context that maximizes the possibility of pleasurable, goof-free baking. Photo-illustrated how-to's in the formulas further the cause. A quibble is the absence in many of the recipe headnotes of descriptive material about the baked good they introduce--it's important to provide info on techniques and ingredients, as the headnotes do, but baking recipes in particular cry out for descriptions of what, for example, sfogliatelle (an Italian pastry), or lime-glazed cookies are. This said, the book is immensely appealing and will excite as well as instruct a wide range of bakers, from the would-be to the accomplished. --Arthur Boehm
From Publishers Weekly
Six years after Stewart's now classic Hors D'Oeuvres Handbook reinvented canapés, here is an end-of-the-meal sequel. General baking tips start things off, most of which are beginner focused (""Read a recipe all the way through""), along with an illustrated guide to baking equipment. Along with expertise, Stewart is also selling the fantasy of wealth; she keeps a vast collection of pots, pans and implements in her own pantry. At times, readers may wish she would offer more suggestions of substitutions for these tools and gadgets (for instance, nearly all the recipes require a stand-up mixer). All the same, this work is, as promised, an essential guide. The recipes include 42 different cookies and 30 cakes, plus pies, tarts, coffee cakes, scones, biscuits, muffins, crackers, bread, fine pastries and more. They range from Classic Apple Pie to twists on standards, like a Tarte Tatin that involves cooking the apples entirely in the oven (instead of on the stovetop) and international goodies like Torta della Nonna. Instructions and sidebars are exhaustive yet accessible. Naturally, the book is exquisitely designed, with beautiful food styling and the spare, closeup photography that's become a hallmark of Stewart publications. Additionally, Stewart includes instructions for decorative crusts, coconut shavings and pastry twists that make her creations look so appealing. (On sale Nov. 1)

Blending African, Carribean, and southern cuisines results in delicious recipes like Smashed Potatoes, Peas, and Corn with Chile-Garlic Oil, a recipe inspired by the Kenyan dish irio, and Cinnamon-Soaked Wheat Berry Salad with dried apricots, carrots, and almonds, which is based on a Moroccan tagine. Creamy Coconut-Cashew Soup with Okra, Corn, and Tomatoes pays homage to a popular Brazilian dish while incorporating classic Southern ingredients, and Crispy Teff and Grit Cakes with Eggplant, Tomatoes, and Peanuts combines the Ethiopian grain teff with stone-ground corn grits from the Deep South and North African zalook dip. There’s perfect potluck fare, such as the simple, warming, and intensely flavored Collard Greens and Cabbage with Lots of Garlic, and the Caribbean-inspired Cocoa Spice Cake with Crystallized Ginger and Coconut-Chocolate Ganache, plus a refreshing Roselle-Rooibos Drink that will satisfy any sweet tooth. 

With more than 100 modern and delicious dishes that draw on Terry’s personal memories as well as the history of food that has traveled from the African continent, Afro-Vegan takes you on an international food journey. Accompanying the recipes are Terry’s insights about building community around food, along with suggested music tracks from around the world and book recommendations. For anyone interested in improving their well-being, Afro-Vegan’s groundbreaking recipes offer innovative, plant-based global cuisine that is fresh, healthy, and forges a new direction in vegan cooking.",13007,"From Booklist
Chef-author Terry (Vegan Soul Kitchen, 2009; The Inspired Vegan, 2012) introduces the concept of food justice, a philosophy that he defines as good food being an everyday right, and not just a privilege. His book is also an introduction to the various ways (more than 100, in short) that African cuisine can go mainstream. Pointing out the high incidence of African Americans with diet-preventable diseases, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes, Terry sets out to help correct that situation one meal at a time, jumping right into specific dishes and their preparation. The first section is about spices and sauces. For instance, familiar seasonings tango with pomegranate-peach barbecue sauce, while slow-braised mustard greens dance with an all-green spring slaw. Each recipe, interestingly, includes at least one soundtrack recommendation, which frequently is also accompanied by a film or book suggestion. His sidebars cover, among other topics, toasting whole spices and cooking black-eyed peas and millet. He’s careful not to overemphasize (and overproselytize) the vegan nature of his recipe collection; instead, he focuses on flavor, on coaxing out unique smells and tastes. --Barbara Jacobs

“Baking from Art of the Pie is like having pie maker Kate McDermott at your elbow, encouraging, instructing and cheering you on. Whether you’re a seasoned pie hand or a beginner with more enthusiasm than skill, Kate’s got you covered.”
- Dorie Greenspan, award-winning author of Dorie’s Cookies

“I’ve been baking pies my entire life, but making them with Kate was a liberating experience. With pioneer spirit she throws the textbook out the window and comes up with absolutely perfect crust filled with fruit that actually sings to you, telling you when it’s ready to be removed from the oven.”
- Ruth Reichl, Former editor of Gourmet, Author of Tender at the Bone and Comfort Me with Apples among other titles

“Kate McDermott will not only teach you how to make a pie―and a damn fine pie at that―she’ll show you how the homey and grounding craft of baking contains important life lessons. Her expertise, creativity, and generosity abound in these pages. The Art of the Pie is destined to be one of those fruit-stained, dog-earred, spine-snapped books you’ll cherish for years.”
- David Leite, LeitesCulinaria.com

“I literally read it cover to cover. Kate’s recipes are logical and easy to follow, her hints and tricks helpful to even the most experienced pie baker. Her level of expertise is through the roof, and her confidence shines through in everything she says.”
- Theresa Carle-Sanders, author of Outlander Kitchen

“In  Kate McDermott, a home baker who teaches Pie Camps across the country, shares dozes of recipes for all the pie combinations you can dream up. What really blew our mind was her recipe for a gluten-free nutty no-bake crust that we want to eat with a gooey chocolate filling at the next pie opportunity. (Note to self: Create more pie opportunities.)”
-

“Though I’ve never had the pleasure of taking one of her pie camp classes, reading her books is the next best thing. Yes, you can pick up the book, turn to a recipe and make something delightful. But reading it is like hanging out with Kate, warm, inviting and comforting.”
-

“Kate McDermott is a pie maker’s pie maker, someone who knows the ins and outs of pie in a way few others do. She brings several decades of experience to her beloved craft. More importantly, however, she exudes the passion and joy we all hope to see in our mentors―the obvious reason that her pie camps and workshops regularly sell out. Kate’s on my short list of the best pie teachers around.”
-

“One of the fondest memories of my life is baking pies with Kate. This extraordinary woman makes magic in the kitchen. Not only did she give me the skills to make spectacular treats for my family and friends, I learnt about love and life. Now, you can, too! And, with Kate, it’s as easy as pie…”
-

“McDermott, a self-taught baker whose workshops have taught hundreds how to make a proper pie, shares that knowledge in one of the best books written on the topic. Those expecting a quick preamble followed by hundreds of pie recipes will be sorely disappointed―basic instructions take up a third of the book―but readers interested in the hows and whys of pie-making will find McDermott’s tutelage invaluable…McDermott excels, giving readers an informative guide they will be referring to for years to come.”
-

“Kate McDermott is a masterful, no, magical teacher. She reminds us that pies, like human beings, don’t have to be perfect, all the while showing us in perfect detail how to make a truly great pie.”

Jenné Claiborne grew up in Atlanta eating classic Soul Food—fluffy biscuits, smoky sausage, Nana's sweet potato pie—but thought she'd have to give all that up when she went vegan. As a chef, she instead spent years tweaking and experimenting to infuse plant-based, life-giving, glow-worthy foods with the flavor and depth that feeds the soul.
 
In Sweet Potato Soul, Jenné revives the long tradition of using fresh, local ingredients creatively in dishes like Coconut Collard Salad and Fried Cauliflower Chicken. She improvises new flavors in Peach Date BBQ Jackfruit Sliders and Sweet Potato-Tahini Cookies. She celebrates the plant-based roots of the cuisine in Bootylicious Gumbo and savory-sweet Georgia Watermelon & Peach Salad. And she updates classics with Jalapeño Hush Puppies, and her favorite, Sweet Potato Cinnamon Rolls.
 
Along the way, Jenné explores the narratives surrounding iconic and beloved soul food recipes, as well as their innate nutritional benefits—you've heard that dandelion, mustard, and turnip greens, okra, and black eyed peas are nutrition superstars, but here's how to make them super tasty, too.

Fittingly, a wonderfully comprehensive section on southern pantry staples devotes almost 6 full pages to sweet potatoes varietals. What looks good: Fluffy sweet potato biscuits, coconut collard salad, “Harlem caviar” black eyed pea salad, Creole red bean sausages, and jackfruit jambalaya."" - Bon Appetit

""Many traditional dishes are off-limits to a vegetarian or vegan, but the smart use of spices and other ingredients can bring them back within reach. This is just what Jenné Claiborne does so beautifully in her new book, Sweet Potato Soul. Claiborne brings Southern flair... to plant-based dishes. That means shredded sweet potatoes and pecans in her granola, coconut three ways (oil, milk and sugar) in her peach cobbler and oyster mushrooms in her étouffée. ...I knew it was the real deal when my fiance, whose people come from Louisiana, took one bite and put down his spoon — so he could take a photo.""  - Washington Post

 Now in a big, personal, and personable book, Dorie captures all the excitement of French home cooking, sharing disarmingly simple dishes she has gathered over years of living in France.
Around My French Table includes many superb renditions of the great classics: a glorious cheese-domed onion soup, a spoon-tender beef daube, and the “top-secret” chocolate mousse recipe that every good Parisian cook knows—but won’t reveal.
 Hundreds of other recipes are remarkably easy: a cheese and olive quick bread, a three-star chef’s Basque potato tortilla made with a surprise ingredient (potato chips), and an utterly satisfying roast chicken for “lazy people.”
 Packed with lively stories, memories, and insider tips on French culinary customs, Around My French Table will make cooks fall in love with France all over again, or for the first time.",19055,"Amazon.com Review
Fall into Cooking Featured Recipe from Dorie Greenspan’s Around My French Table: Pumpkin Stuffed with Everything Good
I've got a slideshow of random snapshots that runs as a screensaver on my computer, and every time the picture of pumpkins for sale at Scott’s Farm Stand in Essex, Connecticut, comes up, I smile. In the picture, it’s a sunny day and the pumpkins, scattered higgledy-piggledy across a big field, look like so many roly-poly playthings. Some people might squint and imagine the jack-o-lanterns that many of these pumpkins are destined to become. Me? I see them sitting in the middle of my dining table, their skins burnished from the heat of the oven and their tops mounded with bubbly cheese and cream. Ever since Catherine, a friend of mine in Lyon, France, told me about how she and her family stuff pumpkins with bread and cheese and bacon and garlic and herbs and cream, I can’t look at a pumpkin on either side of the Atlantic without thinking, ""Dinner!""
Of course, pumpkins are a New World vegetable, but I’m seeing them more and more in the Paris markets, which means I’m making this dish more and more wherever I am. It’s less a recipe than an arts and crafts project; less a formula than a template to play with and make your own.
Basically—and it’s really very basic— you hollow out a small pumpkin, just as you would for a jack-o-lantern, salt and pepper the inside, and then start filling it up. My standard recipe, the one Catherine sent to me, involves seasoning chunks of stale bread, tossing them with bacon and garlic, cubes of cheese (when I’m in France, I use Gruyere or Emmenthal; when I’m in the States, I opt for cheddar) and some herbs, packing the pumpkin with this mix and then pouring in enough cream to moisten it all.
But there’s nothing to stop you from using leftover cooked rice instead of bread--I did that one night and it was risotto-like and fabulous--or from adding dried fruit and chopped nuts, cooked spinach or Swiss chard, or apples or pears, fall’s favored fruits. And I was crazy about the dish when I stirred some cooked hot sausage meat into the mix.

1 pumpkin, about 3 pounds
Salt and freshly ground pepper
¼ pound stale bread, thinly sliced and cut into ½-inch chunks
¼ pound cheese, such as Gruyère, Emmenthal, cheddar, or a combination, cut into ½-inch chunks
2–4 garlic cloves (to taste), split, germ removed, and coarsely chopped
4 strips bacon, cooked until crisp, drained, and chopped
About ¼ cup snipped fresh chives or sliced scallions
1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme
About 1/3 cup heavy cream
Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg

Starred Review. Acclaimed writer and baking wizard Greenspan, author of the James Beard Award-winning Baking, celebrates French home cooking in this noteworthy and visually stunning collection. A part-time Paris resident for more than a decade, Greenspan focuses on what French people really eat at home: easy-to-prepare yet flavorful dishes that are suitable for just about any time of day. From Bacon and Eggs and Asparagus Salad to Chicken in a Pot to Veal Chops with Rosemary Butter, her offerings are hardy, mostly uncomplicated, and superbly appetizing. She also provides sidebars on a wide range of topics, including whether or not to wash raw chicken, several ways of cooking beets, mussels, and more. She offers variations on classic dishes such as Pot-au-Feu, including recipes for seafood and veggie versions that take minutes instead of hours. Recipes include advice on storing leftovers as well as serving information. The chapter on vegetables and grains is particularly welcome, with delectable gratins, lentil, and rice dishes as well as a baby bok choy and sugar snap dish that will make hard-core carnivores drool. A feast for the eyes and palate alike, this superb collection belongs in every foodie's kitchen. Photos. (Oct.)

Armed with industrial tongs, a basting brush, and over 350 new recipes, chef Jamie Purviance and coauthor Sandra S. McRae (Weber's ""corporate poet"") step back behind the grill with Weber's Big Book of Grilling, the searing follow-up to the bestselling Weber's Art of the Grill. We open to a brief history of Weber and a few colorful anecdotes about the early days of the company along with a crash course on choosing a grill, featuring a breakdown of grilling with charcoal versus gas and a quiz to help you determine which grill is best for your cooking needs. Each recipe features the requisite cooking method (direct or indirect heat) and temperature level with techniques that leave plenty of room for individual improvisation. James Beard Award-winning photographer Tim Turner returns with artfully styled color photos of hot-off-the-grill dishes that will make you want to stop reading and start grilling.
Search for a favorite recipe or browse through individual chapters and benefit from Weber's grilling history with helpful guides and sidebars about cuts of meats, cooking methods, tips, glossaries, and illustrated instructions. Every barbecue lover has their favorite bottled sauce or over-the-counter rub, but ""Sauces, Marinades, & Rubs"" will inspire you to make your own (Crazy Cola Barbecue Sauce to an overachieving Type-A Rub) from scratch using common pantry staples. ""Starters"" includes a helpful chart to match up appetizers with entrées along with a recipe for Chinese Chicken Noodle Soup (yes, on the grill--the Asian marinade for the chicken becomes the base for soup). Meat is covered in chapters on beef, pork, lamb, game, poultry, and fish and seafood. Beer-Bathed Brisket gets a little help from a pint of Guinness while a half-filled can of beer props up (and moistens) Beer-Can Chicken. Baby Back Ribs with Spiced Apple-Cider Mop and Buffalo Burgers with Chipotle Mayonnaise will spice up any party, and Lobster Tails with Champagne Vanilla Sauce is every bit as decadent as it sounds. ""Vegetables"" includes a handy vegetable grilling chart along with sections on grilling for vegetarians and quick and easy meat substitutes. ""Sides & Salads"" serves up Couscous-Stuffed Tomatoes and Grilled Garlic Bread while ""Desserts"" wraps everything up with the basics on grilling fruit (Grilled Figs and Goat Cheese Drizzled with Honey or Peaches with Raspberry Sauce and Lemon Cream) and several different takes on campfire favorite, s'mores. Without a doubt, Weber's Big Book of Grilling will get you through the outdoor cooking season, but it will also inspire you to fire up your grill (rain or shine) all year long.

From Publishers Weekly
This book is clearly designed to sell more grills. While Purviance (Weber's Art of the Grill), food editor of Appellation magazine, and McRae, Weber's in-house poet, offer many a delightful starter, entre and dessert, the corporate affiliation of this book remains pervasive, like an unsavory aftertaste. Perhaps it's the way the authors unconvincingly strive to be homey, assuring us, for instance, that ketchup as they know it is always spelled with a ""K."" Or that many anecdotes revolve around a Weber success story, like the time a prime rib dinner helped the company clinch a large distribution contract with Sears. But tackiness aside, the book cannot be faulted for a lack of variety from beef recipes (Stuffed Herbed Tenderloin filled with a paste of rosemary, thyme, sage and mustard, Peanut-Curry Flank Steak) to turkey (Jalape¤o-Peach Turkey Breast, Firehouse Turkey seasoned with cayenne) to seafood (Tequila Shrimp, Gingered Mussels, Parmesan Breaded Scallops). The book is well stocked with helpful charts, glossaries and lists the dessert chapter includes 11 variations of S'mores. Unhappily, though, while Tim Turner's luscious photographs occupy many a full- and double-page spreads, the recipes are crammed two to a page in small type, making this book hard to use on the fly, or in the yard. (June)Forecast: With a foreword by Today Show weatherman Al Roker (who contributes his own rub recipe to the book), lush cover images and strong brand recognition, this book should sell well, but the promotional bonhomie will turn off purists.

Whole Wheat Cornbread
 
Serves 6
 
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) salted butter, plus more for the baking dish
2/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon whole wheat flour
½ cup organic fine cornmeal
1 tablespoon baking powder, sifted
¼ teaspoon salt
1 cup fresh, canned, or thawed frozen corn kernels
½ cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons honey or maple syrup
2 large eggs
½ cup sour cream
 
Preheat the oven to 350°F. With butter, generously grease an 8 x 8-inch baking dish or 9-inch cast-iron skillet.
 
In a large bowl, mix together ⅔ cup of the whole wheat flour, the cornmeal, baking powder, and salt.
 
In a small pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon whole wheat flour and whisk until the roux begins to smell nutty and has a nice light brown color, about 3 minutes. Add the corn and cream. Whisk until the mixture thickens; this should take only a couple of minutes. Mix in the honey and remove from the heat. Let cool slightly.
 
Add the creamed corn mixture, eggs, and sour cream to the bowl with the flour and stir the ingredients well to combine without overmixing.
 
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
 
 
 
Recipe Notes: You can also bake the bread in a loaf pan, but you’ll want to increase the baking time by 15 to 20 minutes.
 
For a little added sweetness, a homemade honey or maple butter is the perfect topping for this cornbread. A word to the wise: It’s a good idea to double this recipe, because you’ll surely want to consume one fresh out of the oven, leaving nothing to serve later with the chili.

Cardiologist Agatston (The South Beach Diet) follows up his blockbuster book on weight-loss with this volume of more than 200 recipes, a number of which are culled from the kitchens of chefs in Miami Beach and other cities. Each recipe is designated as Phase 1, 2 or 3 to help readers discern the segment of the diet for which they are appropriate. Carbohydrates are off-limits during Phase 1, but ""good carbs"" (like whole grains) are gradually reintroduced in Phase 2. Phase 3 segues into a less restrictive but still healthy eating regimen. Among the Phase 1 recipes are the simple Reuben Wrap (which calls for cabbage leaves instead of bread; the author notes readers ""will have to have a 'rye' sense of humor for this""), as well as more complex main dishes such as Coconut Chicken and Sage and Rosemary Pork. Phase 2 and 3 eaters will find delicious options such as Sesame Baked Chicken, Crab Royale and Couscous Salad. Noting that a variety of foods and recipes combats the repetition and boredom that are many dieters' downfall, Agatston presents a wide array of choices, with plenty of enticing fish and vegetarian dishes. He also includes breakfasts, snacks and desserts, as well as ideas for home entertaining ""South Beach-style"" with a focus on fresh veggies, fat-free dips, shrimp and nuts for appetizers, and main dishes of grilled tuna or flank steak. Agatston leaves no stone unturned, even providing shopping lists and recipes for homemade condiments that forgo sugars.

For years, we’ve been told that a healthy diet is heavy on meat, poultry, and fish, and avoids carbohydrates, particularly foods high in starch—empty calories harmful to our bodies.
But what if everything we’ve heard was backwards?
High in calories and cholesterol, animal fats and proteins too often leave you hungry and lead to overeating and weight gain. They are often the root causes of a host of avoidable health problems—from indigestion, ulcers, and constipation to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. On the other hand, complex carbohydrates like whole grains, legumes, tubers, and other starches provide your body with essential proteins and nutrients that satisfy the appetite while simultaneously fighting illness. But Americans eat far too few calories from carbohydrates—only about forty percent, according to Dr. John McDougall, internationally renowned expert on nutrition and health, featured on the documentary Forks Over Knives.
The Healthiest Diet on the Planet helps us reclaim our health by enjoying nutritious starches, vegetables, and fruits. McDougall takes on the propaganda machines pushing dangerous, high-fat fad diets and cuts through the smoke and mirrors of the diet industry. He offers a clear, proven guide to what we should and shouldn’t eat to prevent disease, slow the aging process, improve our physical fitness, be kind to the environment, and be our most attractive selves.
Featuring a unique color picture book that shows us exactly what we should and shouldn’t eat, and two dozen color photos of mouth-watering recipes from Mary McDougall, The Healthiest Diet on the Planet is the easiest way to look great, feel better, and forever change the way we think about health and nutrition.",14427,"Review
Dr John McDougall has been a pioneer in this field of food and health for decades and has contributed much. This new book of his and his wife, Mary, is one more example of what he stands for. His candor says it all. Enjoy the read. (T. COLIN CAMPBELL, Ph.D., coauthor of The China Study)

A pioneer in plant based nutrition, John McDougall crystallizes the flaws of low carbohydrate and Paleo disease producing diets and solidifies the scientifically proven health producing, disease reversal power of whole food plant based nutrition in his new book, The Healthiest Diet on the Planet. (CALDWELL ESSELSTYN, MD, author of Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease)

John and Mary at their best: John presents the accumulating science in favor of “foods-as-grown” for the prevention, arrest and reversal of chronic diseases, for planetary survival and for compassion. He does it with clarity, with punch, and he scores. A homerun! (HANS DIEHL, DrHSc, MPH Clinical Professor of Preventive Medicine, Loma Linda University ; Founder of CHIP, Bestselling author)

A must-have on the shelf of every person who cares about their health, longevity, and happiness. McDougall’s Healthiest Diet on the Planet just makes sense and offers the only solution to a complex problem. (JOHN P. MACKEY, Co-founder and Co-CEO of Whole Foods Market)

Dr. McDougall has created a much-needed book that celebrates why the foods we love the most are also the best for us. With this smartly illustrated guide, he makes it easy for us to know what to eat and what not to eat--and make the healthiest food delicious. (DAN BUETTNER, National Geographic Fellow and New York Times Best Selling Author of The Blue Zones Solution: Eating and Living Like the World's Healthiest People)

Dr. John McDougall is one of the great pioneers of the evidence-based nutrition movement. The Healthiest Diet on the Planet lays out the core elements of healthy eating in the easiest possible terms to understand. (MICHAEL GREGER, MD FACLM, Founder of http://nutritionfacts.org/)

From Almond French Toast to Cheezy Baked Macaroni, from Garden Wraps to Berry Sorbet—Eat the Delicious Foods You Love and Get Healthy.
For years we’ve been told that a healthy diet features piles of meat, poultry, and fish, while diets loaded with carbs and high in starch should be avoided at all costs.
But what if this was all wrong? What if everything we’ve been told about diet and nutrition—everything we’ve been told about food—is completely backwards?
Animal fats and proteins are high in calories and cholesterol, which too often leave us hungry and unsatisfied, a dangerous recipe for overeating and gaining weight. We’re eating the wrong kinds of food and, as a result, we’re all getting fat and sick one meal at a time.
The truth is only complex carbohydrates like whole grains, legumes, root vegetables, and other starch-rich foods can provide your body with the necessary essential nutrients that satisfy your appetite while simultaneously keeping you happy, healthy, and in the best shape of your life.
In The Healthiest Diet on the Planet, internationally renowned expert on nutrition and bestselling author Dr. John McDougall invites us to reclaim our health simply by eating the foods we’ve always loved but were told to never eat. This scientifically proven approach not only encourages us to eat the foods we crave and enjoy, but also has helped hundreds of thousands of people lose unwanted weight, discover more energy, and live longer and stronger. By enjoying nutritious starches, fruits, and vegetables, we can get healthy one satisfying meal at a time. Dr. McDougall offers a delicious, easy-to-follow, and proven guide that lets us enjoy the foods we love again—and, in the process, prevent disease and help reverse aging.

Russ Crandall is the talented home chef behind The Domestic Man, a leading food blog in the Paleo, gluten-free, and whole foods communities. In his 20s he suffered a number of life-threatening illnesses, was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune condition--and was sent home with a lifetime's worth of medications. Disenchanted with modern medicine, Russ started searching for his own answers and quickly discovered that eating a gluten-free, nutrient-rich diet alleviated most of the medical issues that had plagued him for years.

 
Taking cues from traditional cuisines, The Domestic Man inspires readers to look to historical recipes for that ever-elusive key to health. His work has been featured in People Magazine, Food & Wine, and was nominated by Saveur Magazine as one of the Best Food Blogs of 2013. He released his debut cookbook, The Ancestral Table: Traditional Recipes for a Paleo Lifestyle, through Victory Belt Publishing in February 2014.

My patients need information, education, meal plans, ample options, simple recipes, flavor, fun, and the reassurance that what they eat is good for them. This book addresses these needs in a way that provides hope, wellness, and accessibility. It is hard to balance this and still create a book that is not intimidating and appealing to the taste buds. I was excited to see the meal plan option and also the chapter on vegetarian options. I also was delighted by the chapter on desserts. Now when my patients ask me for ideas and start to look at food like medicine I can just give them this reference and off they go! No more handouts. No more missing delights like desserts. No more dead ends for vegetarians. It's all there in wonderful, colorful pictures. I'm excited this book exists.―Dr. Jean Robey, Nephrologist, Arizona Kidney Disease & Hypertension Centers
I often get asked by kidney patients if there is a renal cookbook I can recommend to them. I am very pleased to now have this one available. It's not just a book of recipes; it starts with solid, easy-to-understand information about aspects of the renal diet and why they are important. In order to make a change, we all need to understand the reason for it. The recipes are not complicated and are explained simply so that even a novice in the kitchen can follow them. This is a very well thought-out book by an expert in the field of renal nutrition. I have already recommended this book and will continue to.

The Renal Diet Cookbook supplies a great deal of valuable information and motivation, including excellent advice on getting started in a way that will ease you into the plan.

Richard and Rachael Heller of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York have discovered a revolutionary new diet that eliminates the cravings and helps you to overcome the yo-yo syndrome--permanently--without deprivation. based on the Hellers' nine years of research, thousands of case studies, and their own personal victories over cravings and weight (maintaining a 200 pound loss between them!), this healthful, unique diet features a pleasurable way that adapts to your lifestyle and does away with measuring, food exchanges and calorie counting. A daily Reward Meal, along with wholesome, balanced Complementary Meals, fit easily into busy schedules, restaraunt meals, holiday celebrations, and vacations.
Filled with sound advice and effective strategies--including wonderful recipes and menu plans--this groundbreaking book helps eliminate carbohydrate cravings and puts you in control of your eating and your weight--for life.",34449,"Amazon.com Review
If you've been a yo-yo dieter for years or if you can eat a pound of pasta at one sitting, this book may very well be an eye opener. In simple--but never condescending--language, it explains the roots of carbohydrate cravings and teaches you how to normalize your insulin levels to prevent future food binges. Regulated insulin levels in turn help to temper serotonin levels, so food cravings and mood swings are prevented. The authors, both research scientists (one a health psychologist, the other a pathologist), have lost and kept off a total of 200 pounds between them. They've based this book on nearly a decade's worth of research, during which they've helped nearly 80 percent of their patients lose weight and keep it off for at least a year.
They explain that carbohydrate addicts most commonly crave popcorn, breads, bagels, rice, pasta, potatoes, ice cream, chocolate, pie, cookies, crackers, cake, fruit and fruit juice, potato chips, and pretzels. A questionnaire at the beginning of the book determines if you're indeed a carbohydrate addict, and if so, to what extent. (For those readers whose quiz doesn't indicate addiction, but who are bothered by their food cravings, the authors recommend a doctor's visit for an explanation.) The book includes a diet plan with dozens of easy recipes, a chart of the carbohydrate content of many common foods, and lists of binge triggers to watch for. The most appealing part of the diet--and one reason that it wins raves from its followers--is its once-a-day reward meal, which allows you to eat anything you want. The authors also offer helpful tips for incorporating the diet away from home, such as at parties and restaurants.

from the chapter Soups and Two Mother Sauces

""Once you have mastered a technique, you hardly need look at a recipe again.""

Homemade soups fill the kitchen with a welcome air, and can be so full and natural and fresh that they solve that always nagging question of
""what to serve as a first course.""

***

CHOWDERS

Traditional chowders all start off with a hearty soup base of onions and
potatoes, and that makes a good soup just by itself. To this fragrant base you then add chunks of fish, or clams, or corn, or whatever else seems appropriate. (Note: You may leave out the pork and substitute another tablespoon of butter for sautéing the onions.)

The Chowder Soup Base

For about 2 quarts, to make a 2½-quart chowder serving 6 to 8
4 ounces (2/3 cup) diced blanched salt pork or bacon (see box, page 60)
1 Tbs butter
3 cups (1 pound) sliced onions
1 imported bay leaf
¾ cup crumbled ""common"" or pilot crackers, or 1 pressed-down cup fresh white bread crumbs (see box, page 46)
6 cups liquid (milk, chicken stock [page 4], fish stock [page 5], clam juices, or
a combination)
3½ cups (1 pound) peeled and sliced or diced boiling potatoes
Salt and freshly ground white pepper

Sauté the pork or bacon bits slowly with the butter in a large saucepan for 5 minutes, or until pieces begin to brown. Stir in the onions and bay leaf; cover, and cook slowly 8 to 10 minutes, until the onions are tender. Drain off fat and blend crackers or bread crumbs into onions. Pour in the liquid; add the potatoes and simmer, loosely covered, for
20 minutes or so, until the potatoes are tender. Season to taste with salt and white pepper, and the soup base is ready.



.--For about 2½ quarts, serving 6 to 8. Scrub and soak 24 medium-size hard-shell clams (see box). Steam them for 3 to 4 minutes in a large tightly covered saucepan with 1 cup water, until most have opened. Remove the opened clams; cover, and steam the rest another minute or so. Discard any unopened clams. Pluck meat from the shells, then decant steaming-liquid very carefully, so all sand remains in the saucepan; include the clam-steaming liquid as part of the chowder base. Meanwhile, mince the clam meats in a food processor or chop by hand. Fold them into the finished chowder base. Just before serving, heat to below the simmer--so the clams won't overcook and toughen. Fold in a little heavy cream or sour cream if you wish; thin with milk if necessary, correct seasoning, and serve.

. Scrub one at a time under running water, discarding any that are cracked, damaged, or not tightly closed. Soak 30 minutes in a basin of salted water (1/3 cup salt per 4 quarts water). Lift out, and if more than a few grains of sand remain in the basin, repeat. Refrigerate, covered by a damp towel. It's wise to use them within a day or two.

. Prepare the chowder base using fish stock (page 5), and/or light chicken stock (page 4), and milk. Cut into 2-inch chunks 2 to 2½ pounds of skinless, boneless lean fish, such as cod, haddock, halibut, monkfish, or sea bass, all one kind or a mixture. Add to the finished chowder base and simmer 2 to 3 minutes, just until fish is opaque and springy. Correct seasoning, and top each serving, if you wish, with a spoonful of sour cream.

. Substitute boneless, skinless chicken breasts for fish, and make the chowder base with chicken stock and milk.

. Prepare the chowder base using 6 cups of light chicken stock and milk. Stir 3 cups or so of grated fresh corn into the finished base, adding, if you wish, 2 green and/or red peppers chopped fine and sautéed briefly in butter. Bring to the simmer for 2 to 3 minutes; correct seasoning, and top each serving, if you wish, with a spoonful of sour cream.

Now, for the first time, she chronicles her groundbreaking tenure as editor in chief of Gourmet.

“A must for any food lover . . . Reichl is a warm, intimate writer. She peels back the curtain to a glamorous time of magazine-making. You’ll tear through this memoir.”—Refinery29 (The Best New Books of April 2019)

When Condé Nast offered Ruth Reichl the top position at America’s oldest epicurean magazine, she declined. She was a writer, not a manager, and had no inclination to be anyone’s boss. Yet Reichl had been reading Gourmet since she was eight; it had inspired her career. How could she say no?

This is the story of a former Berkeley hippie entering the corporate world and worrying about losing her soul. It is the story of the moment restaurants became an important part of popular culture, a time when the rise of the farm-to-table movement changed, forever, the way we eat. Readers will meet legendary chefs like David Chang and Eric Ripert, idiosyncratic writers like David Foster Wallace, and a colorful group of editors and art directors who, under Reichl’s leadership, transformed stately Gourmet into a cutting-edge publication. This was the golden age of print media—the last spendthrift gasp before the Internet turned the magazine world upside down.

Complete with recipes, Save Me the Plums is a personal journey of a woman coming to terms with being in charge and making a mark, following a passion and holding on to her dreams—even when she ends up in a place she never expected to be.

Praise for Save Me the Plums

“Poignant and hilarious . . . simply delicious . . . Each serving of magazine folklore is worth savoring. In fact, Reichl’s story is juicier than a Peter Luger porterhouse. Dig in.”—The New York Times Book Review

“In this smart, touching, and dishy memoir . . . Ruth Reichl recalls her years at the helm of Gourmet magazine with clear eyes, a sense of humor, and some very appealing recipes.”—Town & Country (The Must-Read Books of Spring 2019)

“If you haven’t picked up food writing queen Ruth Reichl’s new book, Save Me the Plums, I highly recommend you fix that problem. . . . Reichl is in top form and ready to dish, with every chapter seeming like a dedicated behind-the-scenes documentary on its own.”—Soleil Ho, San Francisco Chronicle",,,,"['ruth reichl', 'gourmet magazine', 'save me the plums', 'new york', 'behind the scenes', 'garlic and sapphires', 'food critic', 'highly recommend', 'conde nast', 'condé nast', 'tender at the bone', 'random house', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

In the fall of 2009, the food world was rocked when Gourmet magazine was abruptly shuttered by its parent company. No one was more stunned by this unexpected turn of events than its beloved editor in chief, Ruth Reichl, who suddenly faced an uncertain professional future. As she struggled to process what had seemed unthinkable, Reichl turned to the one place that had always provided sanctuary. “I did what I always do when I’m confused, lonely, or frightened,” she writes. “I disappeared into the kitchen.”

My Kitchen Year follows the change of seasons—and Reichl’s emotions—as she slowly heals through the simple pleasures of cooking. While working 24/7, Reichl would “throw quick meals together” for her family and friends. Now she has the time to rediscover what cooking meant to her. Imagine kale, leaves dark and inviting, sautéed with chiles and garlic; summer peaches baked into a simple cobbler; fresh oysters chilling in a box of snow; plump chickens and earthy mushrooms, fricasseed with cream. Over the course of this challenging year, each dish Reichl prepares becomes a kind of stepping stone to finding joy again in ordinary things.

The 136 recipes collected here represent a life’s passion for food: a blistering ma po tofu that shakes Reichl out of the blues; a decadent grilled cheese sandwich that accompanies a rare sighting in the woods around her home; a rhubarb sundae that signals the arrival of spring. Here, too, is Reichl’s enlivening dialogue with her Twitter followers, who become her culinary supporters and lively confidants.

Part cookbook, part memoir, part paean to the household gods, My Kitchen Year may be Ruth Reichl’s most stirring book yet—one that reveals a refreshingly vulnerable side of the world's most famous food editor as she shares treasured recipes to be returned to again and again and again.

Praise for My Kitchen Year

“Ruth is one of our greatest storytellers today, which you will feel from the moment you open this book and begin to read: No one writes as warmly and engagingly about the all-important intersection of food, life, love, and loss. This book is a lyrical and deeply intimate journey told through recipes, as only Ruth can do.”—Alice Waters

“What will send this book to the top of bestseller lists is the lovely way Reichl describes how dishes come together, like the Greek chicken soup with lemon and egg known as avgolemono, and her talent for assembling a collection of recipes her legions of former Gourmet fans will want to make themselves.”—The Washington Post

“The recipes make for lovely reading, full of Reichl’s elemental wisdom. . . . In the best way possible, My Kitchen Year is cozy, the reading equivalent of curling up next to a fire with a glass of red wine and perhaps the scent of bread in the oven wafting over.”—Vogue

“If anyone can convince us that a dessert, plus two more fabulous dishes, can turn a crummy day around, it’s culinary writer Ruth Reichl, who knows firsthand just how powerful food can be.”—O: The Oprah Magazine

“The voice is pure Reichl in a way that makes the reader yearn for a house in the country with a pantry full of staples. . . . And as she finds solace through cooking, we find comfort too.”—Eater (Fall 2015’s Best Cookbooks)",16352,"Amazon.com Review
An Amazon Best Book of October 2015: When Gourmet magazine shut its doors in 2009, longtime editor in chief Ruth Reichl was as blindsided by the news as the rest of us. In times of upheaval and uncertainty we are reflexively drawn to what comforts us and for Reichl that means cooking. My Kitchen Year is four seasons of intimate anecdotes and recipes chronicling the first year of Reichl’s post-Gourmet life. It is a cookbook with diary-style entries reflecting on the day and what led to the next recipe. The photography, like the rest of the book, is beautifully produced and never fussy—the perfect pairing for dishes inspired by tears, laughter, love, and a need to feel grounded when life has gone careening off the rails. My Kitchen Year is astonishingly personal and Ruth Reichl’s willingness to share not only her cherished recipes but also her thoughts and feelings during a year of transition make My Kitchen Year a very special volume. -- Seira Wilson

Nestled in the heart of midtown New York is a little shop with a big story. An all-natural bake shop that specializes in Southern baked goods, Donna Bell’s is owned by Pauley Perrette, the actress who plays Abby Sciuto on CBS’s NCIS, and her two best friends, Darren Greenblatt and Matthew Sandusky. It was named in honor of Pauley’s late mother, who is the beloved inspiration for everything they bake.

It all started in 1993, when Pauley met Darren in New York City’s Hell’s Kitchen, just blocks away from where the shop is currently located. The two became inseparable friends and Pauley’s Southern mom would welcome Darren to their home with mouthwatering treats. Darren loved this food and soon left his successful career in fashion to open a food truck that sold Southern desserts at the Jersey Shore. Eventually he wanted to expand and turned to Pauley and their friend Matthew—who worked in the Los Angeles food industry—for help. Soon Matthew was on his way to New York to open Donna Bell’s Bake Shop with Pauley and Darren.

With recipes for favorites like buttermilk biscuits, chocolate chip-almond scones, and peach streusel muffins; personal photographs from Pauley, Darren, Matthew, and Donna Bell herself; this is the story how one fantastic bake shop brings warmth and happiness—one treat at a time—to the urban jungle that is New York City.",519858,,"About the Author

Rombauer, Marion Rombauer Becker, Ginnie Hofmann (Illustrator), Ikki Matsumoto (Illustrator)",4.6,268,,35.95,,"Joy is the all-purpose cookbook. There are other basic cookbooks on the market, and there are fine specialty cookbooks, but no other cookbook includes such a complete range of recipes in every category: everyday, classic, foreign and de luxe. Joy is the one indispensable cookbook, a boon to the beginner, treasure for the experienced cook, the foundation of many a happy kitchen and many a happy home.

Privately printed in 1931, Joy has always been family affair, and like a family it has grown. Written by Irma Starkloff Rombauer, a St. Louisan, it was first tested and illustrated by her daughter, Marion Rombauer Becker, and subsequently it was revised and enlarged through Marion's efforts and those of her architect husband, John W. Becker. Their sons—Ethan, with his Cordon Bleu and camping experiences, and Mark, with his interest in natural foods-have reinforced Joy in many ways.

Now over forty, Joy continues to be a family affair, demonstrating more than ever the awareness we all share in the growing preciousness of food. Special features in this edition are the chapter on Heat, which gives you many hints on maintaining the nutrients in the food you are cooking, and Know Your Ingredients, which reveals vital characteristics of the materials you commonly combine, telling how and why they react as they do; how to measure them; when feasible, how to substitute one for another; as well as amounts to buy. Wherever possible, information also appears at the point of use.

Divided into three parts, Foods We Eat, Foods We Heat and Foods We Keep, Joy now contains more than 4500 recipes, many hundreds of them new to this edition—the first full revision in twelve years. All the enduring favorites will still be found. In the chapter on Brunch, Lunch and Supper Dishes there are also interesting suggestions for using convenience and leftover foods. Through its more than 1000 practical, delightful drawings by Ginnie Hofmann and Ikki Matsumoto, Joy shows how to present food correctly and charmingly, from the simplest to the most formal service; how to prepare ingredients with classic tools and techniques; and how to preserve safely the results of your canning and freezing.

Joy grows with the times; it has a full roster of American and foreign dishes: Strudel, Zabaglione, Rijsttafel, Couscous, among many others. All the classic terms you find on menus, such as Provencale, bonne femme, meunière and Florentine, are not merely defined but fully explained so you yourself can confect the dish they characterize. Throughout the book the whys and wherefores of the directions are given, with special emphasis on that vital cooking factor—heat. Did you know that even the temperature of an ingredient can make or mar your best-laid plans? Learn exactly what the results of simmering, blanching, roasting and braising have on your efforts. Read the enlarged discussion on herbs, spices and seasonings, and note that their use is included in suitable amounts in the recipes. No detail necessary to your success in cooking has been omitted.

Joy, we hope, will always remain essentially a family affair, as well as an enterprise in which its authors owe no obligation to anyone but to themselves and to you. Choose from our offerings what suits your person, your way of life, your pleasure—and join us in the Joy of cooking.

Because of the infinite patience that has gone into the preparation of Joy of Cooking, the publishers offer it on a money-back guarantee. Without question there is no finer all-purpose cookbook.",41270,"Amazon.com Review
Since its first private printing in 1931, The Joy of Cooking has been teaching Americans how to cook. Craig Claiborne calls it ""a masterpiece of clarity"" and Julia Child says it's the one book she'd keep if she could only have one English title on the shelf. The nearly 5,000 recipes are handily organized by meal and ingredient, and no cooking instruction goes unexplained, so you can finally understand the difference between poaching and braising. The book includes nutritional information as well as an extremely helpful list of measures and equivalents. You'll find a version of every recipe your mother ever cooked, along with straightforward instructions for cooking more exotic specialties such as turtles and muskrats.
Review
James Beard The classic work, which covers the entire gamut of kitchen procedures and is easy to use.

Cecily Brownstone Important as is the information in this encyclopedic cookbook, it's the imprint of Irma Rombauer's and Marion Rombauer Becker's personalities that makes Joy of Cooking the best loved cookbook to come out of these United States.

Julia Child ...it is definitely number one on my list...the one book of all cookbooks in English that I would have on my shelf -- if I could have but one.

Craig Claiborne The finest basic cookbook available. It is a masterpiece of clarity.

Julia Child and Jacques Pépin are synonymous with good food, and in these pages they demonstrate techniques (on which they don’t always agree), discuss ingredients, improvise, balance flavors to round out a meal, and conjure up new dishes from leftovers. Center stage are carefully spelled-out recipes flanked by Julia’s and Jacques’s comments—the accumulated wisdom of two lifetimes of honing their cooking skills. Nothing is written in stone, they imply. And that is one of the most important lessons for every good cook.

So sharpen your knives and join in the fun as you learn to make:
 
• Appetizers: from traditional and instant gravlax to your own sausage in brioche and a country pâté
• Soups: from New England chicken chowder and onion soup gratinée to Mediterranean seafood stew and that creamy essence of mussels, billi-bi
• Eggs: omelets and “tortillas”; scrambled, poached, and coddled eggs; eggs as a liaison for sauces and as the puffing power for soufflés
• Salads and Sandwiches: basic green and near-Niçoise salads; a crusty round seafood-stuffed bread, a lobster roll, and a pan bagnat
• Potatoes: baked, mashed, hash-browned, scalloped, souffléd, and French-fried
• Vegetables: the favorites from artichokes to tomatoes, blanched, steamed, sautéed, braised, glazed, and gratinéed
• Fish: familiar varieties whole and filleted (with step-by-step instructions for preparing your own), steamed en papillote, grilled, seared, roasted, and poached, plus a classic sole meunière and the essentials of lobster cookery
• Poultry: the perfect roast chicken (Julia’s way and Jacques’s way); holiday turkey, Julia’s deconstructed and Jacques’s galantine; their two novel approaches to duck
• Meat: the right technique for each cut of meat (along with lessons in cutting up), from steaks and hamburger to boeuf bourguignon and roast leg of lamb 
• Desserts: crème caramel, profiteroles, chocolate roulade, free-form apple tart—as you make them you’ll learn all the important building blocks for handling dough, cooking custards, preparing fillings and frostings
• And much, much more . . .

Throughout this richly illustrated book you’ll see Julia’s and Jacques’s hands at work, and you’ll sense the pleasure the two are having cooking together, tasting, exchanging ideas, and raising a glass to savor the fruits of their labor. Again and again they demonstrate that cooking is endlessly fascinating and challenging and, while ultimately personal, it is a joy to be shared.",88816,"Amazon.com Review
Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home is the companion volume to Julia Child and Jacques Pepin's PBS series of the same name. The setup works like this: the two opinionated TV cooks confront different ingredients on each show, then make their way through to the finished dishes that make up a meal. The recipes reveal themselves along the way.
What's most important here--and it shows up in the cookbook--is that there is no one way to cook. The point of the book isn't to follow recipes, but to cook from the suggestions. And Julia and Jacques have many, many suggestions when it comes to home cooking in the French style. And many tips, for that matter.
Take chicken, for example. ""Not everything I do with my roast chicken is necessarily scientific,"" Julia says. ""For instance, I always give my bird a generous butter massage before I put it in the oven. Why? Because I think the chicken likes it--and, more important, I like to give it."" Julia sets her chicken on a V-rack in a roasting pan in a 425-degree oven that she then turns down to 350 after 15 minutes. Jacques roasts his bird at 425, on its side, right in the pan. ""To me,"" he says, ""it's very important to place the chicken on its side for all but 10 minutes of roasting."" After 25 minutes he turns his chicken over, careful not to tear the skin, and lowers the heat to 400. The bird finishes breast-side up for the last 15 to 20 minutes.
This book is divided into chapters on appetizers, soups, eggs, salads and sandwiches, potatoes, vegetables, fish, poultry, meats, and desserts. The she said-he said format works throughout, and a lot of what's said you may realize you have heard before. There are no big surprises here. But it's good fun, a decent reminder of some of the classics of French tradition, and a chance to loosen up and simply cook at home with a couple of masters--one to the right of you, one to the left. You decide which hamburger's the right one for you. --Schuyler Ingle

From Publishers Weekly
Culinary grande dame Child and master chef P?pin define ""the basics of fine food that looks good, tastes the way it should and is a total pleasure to eat."" Chapters are organized into appetizers, soups, eggs, salads and sandwiches, potatoes, vegetables, fish, poultry, meats and desserts. Based on the vast experience of these chefs, the book takes a she says/he says approach to home-style French cooking: While Julia finds the dark digestive vein in shrimp ""ugly"" and automatically removes it, Jacques considers it ""perfectly good protein to eat""; Julia prefers seasoning food with white pepper, but Jacques uses black pepper, and so forth. Child and P?pin recycle familiar Franco-American classics, like Omelets, Souffl?s, French Fries, Sole Meuni?re, Roast Chicken, Steak Au Poivre and Cr?me Br?l?e, with a contemporary sleight-of-hand (e.g., stocks that can be made within an hour; a microwave method for clarified butter). Eschewing today's trendy global pantry, recipes emphasize fresh, seasonal ingredients. There is also no shortage of shopping, preparation and technique tips from the pros, such as Jacques's perspective on buying a good steak: ""it's more useful to have knowledge about cuts of meat than a lot of money."" A charismatic tag team, veterans Child and P?pin illuminate novice and seasoned home cooks alike, gently reminding readers that ""eating, as well as cooking, should be pleasurable and guiltless."" First serial to Gourmet; Good Cook Book Club main selection; author tour. (Sept.) FYI: Cooking at Home is based on a forthcoming 22-part PBS series.

Elizabeth Yarnell developed her revolutionary infusion-cooking method to avoid often mushy slow-cooker results and to make cooking and cleaning up after dinner a breeze. Now anyone with too many tasks and not enough time can use her technique to get dinner on the table in an hour or less, with no more than twenty minutes of hands-on prep work—and just one pot to clean. All it takes is a Dutch oven and a few basic fresh or even frozen ingredients layered--never stirred. Glorious One-Pot Meals provides the most convenient method yet of serving highly nutritious, satisfying suppers every night of the week.",64578,"From Publishers Weekly
Sometimes the simplest-seeming cookbooks yield the most surprising revelations, as in nutritionist Yarnell's guide to one-pot cooking. Yarnell's signature infusion method, cooking in a dutch oven at a very hot temperature renders layered vegetables, starches and proteins like tandoori salmon and kale with butternut squash over basmati rice, into a surprisingly well-textured, hearty meal. (It's also foolproof: when you smell the aroma of dinner, you're three minutes from the end of the cooking time.) Dishes like citrus ginger chicken with root vegetables; penne puttanesca; and fiesta steak are simple choices for busy weeknight dinners. The real genius, of course, is the single pot—Yarnell's all-inclusive meals don't require the usual juggling of oven times to coordinate complementary dishes, and cleanup is simplified even further by a preliminary canola oil spritz on the pot. Her emphasis on whole foods, abundant servings of vegetables, moderate amounts of protein and the incorporation of whole grains like amaranth and quinoa justifies her health claims. Yarnell also guides readers in creating their own custom versions of the one-pot meal, even offering a one-pot meal weekly grocery list. (Dec.)

Review
“When I hear ‘crisp vegetables, tender meats, incredible flavor, ONE pot, and ready in less than thirty minutes,’ I say COUNT ME IN! That’s my Quick Fix mantra! Who doesn’t cherish strategies that deliver wholesome, family-friendly meals in just minutes? All in one pot, which makes for easy cleanup. Glorious One-Pot Meals offers tons of variety, from the fabulously ordinary to the incredibly extraordinary. Fish dishes range from Very, Very Mild Fish to Honey-Chili Trout and Pistachio Halibut (with lavender!). Elizabeth tempts you with All-American Pot Roast and Corned Beef and Cabbage and then wows you with Amaranth Chili. Ready to move beyond Simply Chicken and Chicken Marsala? Then try the African Peanut Butter Stew. Or leap from Glorious Macaroni and Cheese to Aloo Gobi (a flavor-packed, Indian feast). If you’ve got a pot, you’ve got a meal. There’s truly something for everyone.

From Cooking for Geeks: Butternut Squash Soup
Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:
2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)
2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock
1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed
1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)
Notes
The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.
This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash soup.
If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.
Pumpkin Cake
There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs. For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.
Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).
In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:
1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)
1 cup (200g) sugar
3/4 cup (160g) canola oil
2 large (120g) eggs
1 1/2 cups (180g) flour
1/4 cup (40g) raisins
2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon
1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder
1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda
1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt
1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract
Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.
Notes
Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them on top.
One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.",104092,"Review

From Martha Stewart's Cupcakes: Martha’s Meyer Lemon Cupcakes

The mild and sweet flavor of Meyer lemon is one of Martha’s favorites; these zest-flecked cupcakes are filled with Meyer lemon curd, which peeks out from the tops. The fruit, which is actually a lemon-orange hybrid, is generally available at specialty stores in winter and early spring. If you can’t find Meyer lemons, use regular lemons instead. The recipe yields a lot of cupcakes, so you may want to consider these for a bake sale or large gathering, such as a shower or special birthday celebration.
Cupcake Ingredients
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
2 tablespoons finely grated Meyer lemon zest, plus 2 tablespoons fresh Meyer lemon juice (from 1 to 2 Meyer lemons)
1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line standard muffin tins with paper liners. Whisk together flour, zest, baking powder, and salt.

1. Combine whole eggs and yolks, sugar, and lemon juice in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat. Add butter, a few pieces at a time, whisking until smooth after each addition. Strain through a fine sieve into another bowl, and cover with parchment paper or plastic wrap, pressing it directly on surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until chilled and firm, at least 2 hours (or up to 2 days).

In this meditation on cooking and eating, Tamar Adler weaves philosophy and instruction into approachable lessons on feeding ourselves well. An Everlasting Meal demonstrates the implicit frugality in cooking. In essays on forgotten skills such as boiling, suggestions for what to do when cooking seems like a chore, and strategies for preparing, storing, and transforming ingredients for a week’s worth of satisfying, delicious meals, Tamar reminds us of the practical pleasures of eating. She explains what cooks in the world’s great kitchens know: that the best meals rely on the ends of the meals that came before them. With that in mind, she shows how we often throw away the bones, skins, and peels we need to make our food both more affordable and better. She also reminds readers that almost all kitchen mistakes can be remedied. Summoning respectable meals from the humblest ingredients, Tamar breathes life into the belief that we can start cooking from wherever we are, with whatever we have.

An empowering, indispensable work, An Everlasting Meal is an elegant testimony to the value of cooking.",41476,"Review
“An Everlasting Meal is beautifully intimate, approaching cooking as a narrative that begins not with a list of ingredients or a tutorial on cutting an onion, but with a way of thinking…. Tamar is one of the great writers I know—her prose is exquisitely crafted, beautiful and clear-eyed and open, in the thoughtful spirit of M.F.K. Fisher. This is a book to sink into and read deeply.” —Alice Waters, from the Foreword

""It can be tricky, in this age of ethically charged supermarket choices, to remember that eating is an act of celebration. Tamar Adler's terrific book wisely presents itself as a series of how to’s—How To Boil Water, How to Have Balance, How to Live Well—with the suggestion that it's not only possible to do all these things, but in fact a pleasure. An Everlasting Meal provides the very best kind of lesson (reminding us we enjoy being taught), that there is real joy to be had in eating, and eating well."" --Dan Barber, Chef/Co-Owner of Blue Hill and Blue Hill at Stone Barns

“Tamar Adler understands a simple truth that seems to evade a lot of cookbook writers and self-proclaimed ‘foodies’: cooking well isn't about special equipment or exotic condiments or over-tested recipes (and it sure isn't about ‘quickfire challenges’ or kicking it up a notch). It's about learning some basics, respecting the ingredients, and developing a little culinary intuition, or maybe just plain common sense. A book can’t necessarily teach you how to do that, but An Everlasting Meal will almost certainly inspire you to teach yourself.” --Colman Andrews, author of The Country Cooking of Italy and Editorial Director of TheDailyMeal.com

“In this beautiful book, Tamar Adler explores the difference between frugal and resourceful cooking. Few people can turn the act of boiling water into poetry. Adler does. By the time you savor the last page, your kitchen will have transformed into a playground, a boudoir and a wide open field. An Everlasting Meal deserves to be an instant and everlasting culinary classic.” –Raj Patel, author of The Value of Nothing and Stuffed and Starved

"" is a great thrill to read. Anyone who cooks is engaged in a re-creation of the Enlightenment Age--beginning with alchemy and mystery, always grasping towards chemistry and a tasty supper. With this book, Tamar Adler has chronicled our epic. Her tone manages to make the reader almost feel like he is thinking out loud. A marvelous accomplishment."" –contributing writer to the

This special cookbook puts flavor and choice back on the menu for people with diabetes and their families
Betty Crocker, America's most trusted friend in the kitchen, has teamed up with the International Diabetes Center (IDC)--one of the leading medical centers--to create an indispensable source of easy-to-make recipes and up-to-the-minute food and nutrition information for the growing numbers of people who have diabetes, more than 15 million of them.
Here is the first cookbook to include recipes featuring Carbohydrate Choices--the new, simplified approach to meal planning recommended by the American Diabetes Association. For people who find diet exchanges too hard, too limiting or too much work, this new method is a real breakthrough. Each of the book's 140 recipes shows the number of Carbohydrate Choices per serving, so that planning the rest of the meal is easy. From Old-Time Beef and Vegetable Stew to Creamy Vanilla-Caramel Cheesecake, the recipes are made with everyday ingredients, including sugar. No food groups or ingredients are left out, so there's no need for anyone to feel deprived or restricted to a special diet. Food exchanges are also included, making it easy for those who still count calories.
Betty Crocker's Diabetes Cookbook is also packed with expert medical and nutrition tips from Dr. Richard Bergenstal, an endocrinologist and diabetes doctor, and two registered nurses--invaluable for the newly diagnosed as well as for those who have been coping with diabetes for years. Throughout the book, real-life advice from people who have diabetes offers inspiration and great ideas on dealing with this chronic disease. When it comes to eating and living with diabetes, people need guidance and advice they can trust.",251283,"From the Inside Flap
No matter what type of diabetes you have, the diagnosis can feel overwhelming. You may have questions about what you can or should eat and whether there are some foods you have to give up altogether-that's where this book can help. Betty Crocker, teamed with diabetes experts from the International Diabetes Center, has created an all-in-one diabetes resource, filled with delicious recipes and up-to-the-minute medical and nutrition information.

Here's great news about diabetes: The best-kept secret of diabetes food planning is that it's good for everyone. You may think that people with diabetes need special foods prepared special ways, but as you look through this book, you'll find a wide variety of delicious and satisfying foods that you can eat-and that the whole family will enjoy.

This book is designed to make meals easy. It's our first cookbook to count Carbohydrate Choices for every recipe, following the latest guidelines of the American Diabetes Association.

You'll also turn to this book for its easy-to-follow health information, from an explanation of the types of diabetes to a nutrition primer and a medical resource guide. The section ""Diabetes Care: It's in Your Hands"" empowers you to understand your care process. The goal is to help you feel in control of your diabetes, instead of letting diabetes control you.

Throughout, you'll find plenty of encouragement. There's real-life advice from people with diabetes, as well as parents of kids with diabetes and other caregivers who deal with diabetes day in, day out.

Finally, you'll find a week's worth of delicious menus, complete with breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack ideas, followed by a glossary of medical, nutrition and other diabetes terms.

As a source for recipes and so much more, Betty Crocker's Diabetes Cookbook will become your all-in-one diabetes resource.

It's dinnertime. Do you know where your sugar is coming from? Most likely everywhere. Sure, it's in ice cream and cookies, but what scared Eve O. Schaub was the secret world of sugar―hidden in bacon, crackers, salad dressing, pasta sauce, chicken broth, and baby food.
With her eyes opened by the work of obesity expert Dr. Robert Lustig and others, Eve challenged her husband and two school-age daughters to join her on a quest to quit sugar for an entire year.
Along the way, Eve uncovered the real costs of our sugar-heavy American diet―including diabetes, obesity, and increased incidences of health problems such as heart disease and cancer. The stories, tips, and recipes she shares throw fresh light on questionable nutritional advice we've been following for years and show that it is possible to eat at restaurants and go grocery shopping―with less and even no added sugar.
Year of No Sugar is what the conversation about ""kicking the sugar addiction"" looks like for a real American family―a roller coaster of unexpected discoveries and challenges.
""As an outspoken advocate for healthy eating, I found Schaub's book to shine a much-needed spotlight on an aspect of American culture that is making us sick, fat, and unhappy, and it does so with wit and warmth.""―Suvir Sara, author of Indian Home Cooking
""Delicious and compelling, her book is just about the best sugar substitute I've ever encountered.""―Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Powers",241007,"From Booklist
A confirmed sugar addict since childhood, Schaub was shocked to discover the role of sugar in an array of illnesses and the fact that sugar (mostly high fructose corn syrup) is an ingredient in nearly every American food product. She challenged her family (husband and two young daughters) to join her in a year of abstention from added sugar (everything from table sugar to molasses to fruit juice) and chronicled their trials and triumphs. Inspired by the research of Dr. Robert Lustig (Fat Chance), Schaub learned the connection between overconsumption of sugar and cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Her own research identified sugar in most school and restaurant meals and in surprising places on the store shelves, including sauces, dressings, soups, and breads. She debunks questionable nutritional advice, pokes fun at her own past experiments with health fads, and recalls the particular challenges of sweets-laden Halloween and Christmas. At the end of the year, the family was healthier, and they had accumulated a store of ideas and recipes (included in the book) to counter the craving for something sweet. --Vanessa Bush
Review
""The diary I wish I had kept ... the adventures of her family, the roadblocks they encountered, and the sheer daily difficulty of overcoming a national obsession."" - From the foreword by David Gillespie, author of Sweet Poison

""Eve O. Schaub's Year of No Sugar has the potential to alter your deeply rooted convictions regarding the innocent pleasure of sugar."" - Betsy Shaw, Babycenter.com blogger and former Olympic snowboarder

""The surface charm of Year of No Sugar-breezy wit, blithe anecdote and effortless evocation of people and the stuff they put in their mouths-cannot conceal Schaub's deeper purpose: a takedown of sugar, its disarming myths, its dangerous presence in nearly everything we eat, and its cynical marketing. Delicious and compelling, her book is just about the best sugar substitute I've ever encountered."" - Pulitzer-Prize-winning author Ron Powers

""[Schaub] debunks questionable nutritional advice, pokes fun at her own past experiments with health fads, and recalls the particular challenges of sweets-laden Halloween and Christmas. At the end of the year, the family was healthier, and they had accumulated a store of ideas and recipes (included in the book) to counter the craving for something sweet."" - Booklist

""Delightfully readable account of how [Schaub] and her family survived a yearlong sugar-free diet-and lived to tell the tale. ... A funny, intelligent and informative memoir."" - Kirkus

""informative and hilarious ... Eve and her husband tackled every blip, fit and question with a heaping dose of good humor."" -

""Eve Schaub has certainly heightened my awareness of sugar. After reading , I haven't been able to walk in the grocery store without reading a label (which I always did, but now it's really consuming). If you're looking for an entertaining read, pick up a copy and see if you can't help but avoiding the sweet stuff-even that can be addictive."" -

""I admire Eve and her family for their stick-to-itiveness, and I highly recommend . It's a quick read, but will leave you thinking for a long time. It certainly raised my awareness."" -

""Schaub is a wonderful storyteller. Her sense of humor and ability to paint pictures of situations they find themselves makes a pleasure to read. Whether or not you decide to follow in her footsteps concerning limiting or removing sugar from your diet, you will undoubtedly enjoy reading her story, and find lots of food for thought as well. "" -

""Vermont author Eve O. Schaub chronicles how her family (husband, two school-age daughters) tried to banish fructose and ""it's many, many aliases"" from their life. Easier said than done, since the stuff has snuck into everything from ketchup to salad dressing to bacon. When Schaub announces the plan, both girls break into hysterical tears (one later describes her sugar-free family as ""mutants""). But as the months progress, their sweets cravings diminish (substitutes help, like brown rice syrup), and they feel happier and healthier."" -

As millions of people know, one of the toughest things about completing the Whole30 is figuring out what to eat next, the other 335 days of the year. Teri Turner, creator of No Crumbs Left, has healthful and great tasting answers. Food is Teri’s love language, and her approach to getting people into the kitchen, rolling up their sleeves, and cooking is contagious. “Don’t be afraid to fail: it’s just food,” is one of her mantras. Teri’s passion is evident on every page of her first cookbook, as she leads readers through a discovery of new flavors and spice combinations and teaches people to trust their cooking instincts. Teri’s recipes, most of which are gluten-free, grain-free, dairy-free, and Whole30 compliant, are what makes No Crumbs Left so unique. Simple and incredibly delicious dishes such as Pistachio Pesto Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pad Thai, and Spicy Pepperoncini Beef are on the dinner table quickly. The impossibly easy Sugar Snap Pea Salad features two of Teri’s signature Magic Elixirs, Green Goddess Dressing and Smoky Pepitas, which are both made in advance and kept on hand to elevate countless meals. Her signature Marinated Red Onions, 999 Island Dressing, Gomasio, and Spicy Almond Sauce are true secret weapons. The Family chapter features the special recipes her own children grew up with and evoke home, love, and motherhood. Teri considers this book a love letter to her mother, and woven throughout are tips and favorite quotes to bring you right into her kitchen, where there is always an extra seat at the table.",906,"Review
“The first No Crumbs Left recipe I ever made was the Sizzling Everyday Roasted Chicken Breasts. I looked at the ingredients and thought, ‘How did she get this famous from cooking chicken with just four ingredients?’ But I trusted Teri and followed the recipe to the letter. It was the best chicken of my life: Simple. Juicy. Delicious. At that point, I became the self- appointed President of the Teri Turner Fan Club.”
—from the Foreword by Melissa Hartwig Urban, Whole30 Co-founder

“I have been following Teri on Instagram for years and have become such a fan of her no-nonsense approach to delicious and healthy food. Every dish of hers I have tried has become a staple in my house. I’m thrilled that she now holds a very special place on my cookbook shelf. Let’s go!”
—Jesse Tyler Ferguson, actor and ambitious home cook

“Teri Turner is a cook’s best friend, combining the wisdom of Julia Child and the encouragement of the mom of your dreams! Her new cookbook is packed with instant classics, from magic elixirs that kick up the flavor of any weeknight dish to jaw-dropping showstoppers. You won’t be able to put down this book!”
—Michelle Tam, New York Times best-selling cookbook author and creator of Nom Nom Paleo

“Full of magic, wholesome recipes and decadently delicious food, No Crumbs Left is truly a treasure. Teri’s beautiful soul and nurturing nature is woven throughout the pages, and it’s like she’s beside you in the kitchen cheering, “Let’s go!” An instant family classic. I’ll be making these recipes for years to come.”
—Brittany Williams, author of the national best-selling Instant Loss Cookbook

“I love Teri’s unique approach to making food. She has such incredible techniques that help make typically boring meals absolutely delicious!”


“For real family food with heart & soul, look no further that than the unstoppable Teri Turner. This book is filled with dinner inspiration and cooking confidence that will urge you into the kitchen!”

CHAPTER 1

YOU'VE BEEN ROLLED, TOSSED, AND BAKED

""Follow a balanced diet low in fat.""

""You need whole grains for B vitamins and fiber.""

""It's unhealthy to eliminate an entire food group.""

""Everything in moderation.""

This should all sound familiar to you because these nutritional mantras have been repeated over and over by dietitians, doctors, and the media. And, like many such pieces of conventional ""wisdom,"" there is a germ of truth in each of them--but just a germ and nothing more. Following such advice not only does not help you control weight or obtain health, it also destroys your grasp over weight and health. It can be as ineffective as believing that total health is restored by taking a prescription drug, subjecting yourself to a 4-week program of ""cleansing"" enemas, or concealing bulges under a new set of Spanx. Modern misguided dietary advice has made plus-size aisles the busiest place in clothing stores, huffing and puffing commonplace when climbing a single flight of stairs, and type 2 diabetes a double-digit growth industry.

Don't feel bad if you fell for it, choosing lean cuts and trimming the fat off meat, reaching for low-fat yogurt, and opting for whole grain breads, muffins, and bagels. Many beliefs, once accepted as gospel, have fallen by the wayside over the years, kicked to the curb by new discoveries, new science, and new understanding. It wasn't all that long ago that you would have been burned at the stake for believing that the earth revolved around the sun, been prosecuted for voicing the wrong political views during the McCarthy-era purges, or cheered for Milli Vanilli's ""Girl You Know It's True"" win at the Grammy Awards. Human history is filled with such campaigns of misinformation. But only in the recent past has misinformation permeated nutritional advice on such a grand scale.

HALF-BAKED

When you lose control over your health and weight because you ate ""healthy"" whole grains, doctors--stumped by why you feel so awful despite doing everything ""right""--prescribe drugs with effects that create the ""need"" for even more prescription drugs. This is the modern downward health spiral that most people find themselves trapped in today. Once you understand this absurd and self-defeating situation, you are empowered to change it. And you can begin to powerfully reverse this situation over the next 10 days, the number of days it takes your husband to stop procrastinating over fixing a leaky kitchen faucet. This detox process yields a head-to-toe body and health makeover, reprogramming your body at so many levels, both internal and external. Your body and health will undergo a transformation that may even have friends and family not believing it's you.

With the bad science and politics that drove the ""cut your cholesterol, fat, and saturated fat"" agenda of the latter half of the 20th century, the bonfire was lit even brighter by over-the-top profit opportunities for Big Food. The low-fat message gained a huge following. In its wake now lies the result: obesity, diabetes, arthritis, dementia, and other health disasters on a scale never before witnessed in the history of mankind. It's an unprecedented man-made social and health apocalypse that makes reports of tornadoes and radiation spills seem like small-scale annoyances, even banal, with nearly two billion overweight or obese people worldwide (including nearly 50 million children under age 5) and more than half of Americans with diabetes or prediabetes. The low-fat message, because it eliminated a source of satiating calories from fat, caused everyone to resort to more carbohydrates, particularly the carbohydrate source that most nutritional authorities felt to be the healthiest: whole grains, such as whole wheat, oats, and rye.

But, like the message to cut fat and saturated fat--now debunked by more recent studies showing that fat and saturated fat have nothing to do with cardiovascular disease--so the ""eat more healthy whole grains"" message was also based on flawed science and misinterpretations. The purported health benefits of whole grains were based on epidemiological studies (i.e., studies of health in large populations) demonstrating that if white flour products are replaced with whole grains, there is less diabetes, less weight gain, less heart disease, and less colon cancer in the population observed. That is indeed true and not in question. Careers and entire university departments of nutrition have been built on this premise. But the next question should have been: What is the effect of removing grains, white and whole, altogether? We cannot answer that question with the same ""replace one with the other"" epidemiological studies; we have to look elsewhere. Such grain-eliminating studies have indeed already been performed.

What happens when we remove grains? Clinical studies have shown:

• Weight loss (not less weight gain)

• Reduction in overall calorie intake

• Drops in blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c (a long-term measure of blood sugar)--many people with diabetes are cured

• Reduction of blood pressure

• Increased likelihood of remission of rheumatoid arthritis

• Reversal of neurological conditions such as cerebellar ataxia, some forms of seizures, and peripheral neuropathy

• Reversal of multiple forms of skin rash

• Reductions in paranoia and hallucinations in people with schizophrenia

• Improved attention span and behavior in children with attention deficit disorder and autistic spectrum disorder

• Relief from the bowel urgency and disruption of irritable bowel syndrome

That's just a sample of the evidence that already exists in the scientific and clinical literature. This is not conjecture or claims based on a few anecdotes. It is based on a rational, scientific examination of the evidence, coupled with the experiences of millions of people who have come to understand the power of this lifestyle change. When a wheat- and grain- free lifestyle is put to work in real life, the benefits documented in clinical studies can be seen in action with unexpected and dramatic reversal of numerous health conditions.

Such a collection of changes is rare to impossible when weight loss is achieved through a painful few weeks of calorie counting, liposuction, or kickboxing or other strenuous exercise. If this were just a weight-loss program or just a program to shrink your waist, well, that would be sort of interesting in a reality TV sort of way, complete with emotional outbursts and breakdowns. But it would not be accompanied by the sorts of body and health transformations we are seeking. In this detoxification process, we are going to go further than just losing weight; we are going to work to restore health from head to toe. Weight loss, feeling better, and looking younger are simply reflections of the dramatic improvements in health you are going to experience.

In particular, you are likely to experience a powerful reversal of inflammation throughout your body. The reversal of redness, swelling, pain, and hormonal signal disruption that we may experience variously as seborrhea, rheumatoid arthritis, acid reflux, leg swelling, or irrational anger all reflect the receding wave of inflammation previously caused by grains.

These are changes that I observe in people every day with the health strategies detailed in the Wheat Belly books. In this easy-to-consume, bite- size book, you will read about such changes from our detox panelists, even in the brief 10-day timeline of this program. I predict that many of you, like our volunteer panelists, will receive compliments from family and friends after these initial 10 days on how different you look: thinner, yes, but it's not uncommon for your appearance to begin to change, especially that of the face with less eye puffiness, less facial edema, and relief from the redness of the cheeks and seborrhea along the nose (what I call the signature rashes of wheat and related grains), as well as developing better defined facial contours, reduced waist size, smaller hips, reduced cellulite on the thighs, loss of edema in the ankles, even smaller feet--no kidding. I bet you'll even smile more readily, given how much better you feel inside.

The Wheat Belly 10-Day Grain Detox program begins with the elimination of wheat and grains, the essential first step that gets the detoxification process under way. But this detox involves additional strategies for full benefit. These strategies are necessary because they undo many of the unhealthy effects that grains have exerted on your body and that have accumulated over the years, such as abnormal rises in insulin levels and altered composition of bowel flora (the microorganisms that inhabit your intestinal tract). Many of the drugs that your doctor prescribed to treat the destructive health effects of wheat and grain consumption will also need to be reduced or discarded. Remove the initial cause, correct the varied consequences, and the majority of drugs are no longer needed and health can finally reassert itself. Without grains, life is indeed good.

These sorts of benefits have nothing to do with celiac disease, the autoimmune destruction of the small intestine from gluten in wheat, rye, and barley experienced by 1 percent of the population. While this detox program could be undertaken by someone with celiac disease, it is primarily aimed at people without the disease, meaning the other 99 percent of the population. These benefits also have little to do with being ""gluten-free,"" a misleading concept that has the potential to ruin health and weight in other ways, which we'll discuss throughout the book.

Wheat Belly 10-Day Detox Put to the Test

In March 2015, my publisher and I invited a group of volunteers to Rodale's Manhattan offices to undergo an initiation to the Wheat Belly 10-Day Detox program. I had posted a request for volunteers on the Wheat Belly Facebook page and received an outpouring of offers to participate. All panelists shared an interest in getting started on the detox program and obtaining results as quickly as possible. While most expressed a desire to lose weight, all hoped to regain control over various health conditions.

The panelists (all female) in our group came from different parts of the country. To get them started on this process, we helped them understand a bit about why this lifestyle works so wonderfully well, but just as with the rapid-fire approach used in this book, we focused mostly on the how: how to identify grain-containing foods, how to go about eliminating them from their lives, and how to successfully navigate the first 10 days of the detox, including how to deal with the uncomfortable and disruptive process of withdrawal to begin a lifetime of health recovery.

We provided them with the very same recipes that you now have in this book, asking them for feedback, which was then factored in, and we improved on some of the recipes. We weighed them and measured their waists, arms, and hips on the first and last days of the detox. We also asked them for their thoughts on how they dealt with this process; the symptoms, aches, and pains they endured; and any health improvements they experienced. They shared their successes, their failures, the ups and downs of the process, the struggles with converting their kitchens to this new wheat- and grain- free lifestyle, and the sometimes reluctant or skeptical looks they got from family members.

I will be sharing many of the panelists' experiences throughout this book. They all underwent the very same detox program that you are about to begin. All survived and lived to tell their stories.

You will learn also that not only will you not become deficient in nutrients, but that nutrient levels increase with wheat and grain elimination--explaining why, for example, many people experience reversal of iron deficiency anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency with this approach. I also take the mystery out of fiber and show why the conventional notion of a high-fiber diet is largely a fiction of marketing, little different than sprinkling sawdust on your food. There are better ways to achieve bowel and overall health than gnawing on twigs.

The Wheat Belly 10-Day Grain Detox therefore requires not only changes in lifestyle but also changes in your thinking about food and nutrition. Replacing your size 24, meant-to-conceal dress with a sleek, size 4 dress designed to show off your slender new body will go hand in hand with changes in the way you view food, replacing the health- and weight- destroying fictions with advice that actually works.

GRAINS: A HEALTH AND WEIGHT CATASTROPHE

I promised to spare you the science and rationale behind the Wheat Belly concepts. But allow me to sprinkle just a bit of understanding over why this approach works so wonderfully well--so much so that I am sometimes accused of concocting success stories. But I can assure you that no fabrication is necessary because (1) I really don't have that much imagination, and (2) such jaw-dropping successes occur every day, and we can readily add you to the list. I believe that just a little explanation is in order to assure you that this approach is genuine, based on scientific interpretation, not only anecdote or speculation, and that real results can be anticipated.

I call wheat and grain elimination a ""2 + 2 = 11"" effect: The total in this lifestyle is greater than the sum of its parts. Some people initially view the Wheat Belly approach as nothing more than cutting calories or cutting carbohydrates. But this is a misconception due to not recognizing all the reasons why wheat and grains disrupt health and why removing them yields larger-than-expected benefits. Removing all the factors in grains responsible for inflammation, for instance, results in a wide array of weight and health benefits.

So let's do a quick rundown of what is contained in the wheat and grains that make a bran muffin, poppy seed bagel, or tortilla poisonous components of diet. I'll keep it brief, and then we'll pick up again with workable strategies to get you going.

GRAINS YIELD OPIATES. Not figuratively, but quite literally, these opiates are not too different from morphine or heroin. Chances are you are not a pill-popping, tourniquet-on-the-bicep, IV drug-injecting, fringe member of society slinking in corners and dealing in the dark, but rather a nice, law- abiding member of society. The gliadin protein of wheat and closely related proteins of other grains (secalin in rye, hordein in barley, zein in corn) yield, upon partial digestion, small peptides that bind to the opiate receptors of the human brain. In people with conditions such as bipolar illness and schizophrenia, they yield effects such as impulsive behavior and paranoia; in children with attention deficit disorder and autism, they cause behavioral outbursts and shorten attention spans; in people prone to bulimia and binge eating disorder, they cause 24-hour-a-day food obsessions. In those prone to depression, they cause dark moods and even suicidal thoughts.

In people without these conditions, grains ""only"" trigger appetite in an irresistible, never-satisfied way. (Several of our detox panelists shared their experiences, by the way, of being relieved of this appetite effect that had previously ruled their lives.) Most of us take in 400 or more calories per day from this appetite-increasing effect, sometimes as much as 1,000 or more calories per day. Some people even develop incapacitating and addictive relationships with food due to exposure to gliadin-derived opiates, witnessed in their most extreme form as the food obsessions in people prone to eating disorders.

“Never before have I seen so many fascinating, delicious, easy recipes in one book. . . . [Six Seasons is] about as close to a perfect cookbook as I have seen . . . a book beginner and seasoned cooks alike will reach for repeatedly.”
—Lucky Peach

Joshua McFadden, chef and owner of renowned trattoria Ava Gene’s in Portland, Oregon, is a vegetable whisperer. After years racking up culinary cred at New York City restaurants like Lupa, Momofuku, and Blue Hill, he managed the trailblazing Four Season Farm in coastal Maine, where he developed an appreciation for every part of the plant and learned to coax the best from vegetables at each stage of their lives.

In Six Seasons, his first book, McFadden channels both farmer and chef, highlighting the evolving attributes of vegetables throughout their growing seasons—an arc from spring to early summer to midsummer to the bursting harvest of late summer, then ebbing into autumn and, finally, the earthy, mellow sweetness of winter. Each chapter begins with recipes featuring raw vegetables at the start of their season. As weeks progress, McFadden turns up the heat—grilling and steaming, then moving on to sautés, pan roasts, braises, and stews. His ingenuity is on display in 225 revelatory recipes that celebrate flavor at its peak.",2496,"Review
“A great book. Period. . . . Never before have I seen so many fascinating, delicious, easy recipes in one book. . . . In fact, it’s about as close to a perfect cookbook as I have seen. What McFadden and Holmberg have achieved is no small feat: This is a book that will educate nearly everyone who picks it up, a book beginner and seasoned cooks alike will reach for repeatedly. It’s the rare book that achieves what it sets out to do, and manages to do so in a manner that is both appetizing and engaging. It is accessible without sacrificing its artistry.”
—Lucky Peach
 
“The book’s appealingly simple recipes are focused on delivering big flavor.”
—The Wall Street Journal, The Best Books to Give to the Food Lover in Your Life

“Six Seasons: A New Way with Vegetables is poised to join the veggie canon. . . . The flavors are big. . . . They’re also layered and complex, despite their apparent simplicity. What will really change your cooking is [McFadden’s] approach to seasoning. . . . Trust me: Read this book and you’ll never look at cabbage the same way again.”
—Bon Appétit

 “Achieves the near-impossible: Recipe after recipe of restaurant-quality food that isn’t difficult to put together.”
—Eater

“Stellar mix-and-match recipes that highlight produce at its gorgeous peak.”

 
“The cookbook. Have you bought it yet? I know this is awfully bossy of me, but I think you should. I think that if you, like me, delight in inventive but not overly complicated vegetable preparations (225 of them, even), things you hadn’t thought of but that you’ll immediately tuck into your repertoire, you’re going to love this book as much as I do. I confess I’ve had it for almost a year. In that year, I’ve been almost overwhelmed with how much I’ve wanted to cook from it.”


“Exciting flavor combinations mean this is no mere guide to vegetables but a primer on how to make them taste their exciting best.”
—
 
“Downright thrilling. . . . Divided into six seasons rather than the traditional four—a more accurate reflection of what’s happening in the fields—the book encourages readers to embrace what he calls ‘the joyful ride of eating with the seasons. . . .’ On page after page, McFadden presents a deliciously enlightening way of cooking with vegetables.”


“Enduringly rewarding. I am utterly consumed with and feel I could cook from it every day without tiring.”

 
“This cookbook might put meat out of business. It’s that good. . . . A rare source of new ideas about vegetables. McFadden’s forward-looking sensibility infuses every recipe.”

 
“Brilliant.”


“[This is] a cookbook I’ve gotten a little obsessed with. . . . The book offers inspiring treatments for vegetables that are often relegated to a boring crudité tray—if you’re looking for a new way to treat celery or cabbage, you need a copy.”

 
“ is a beautiful book. But it’s more than a pretty face: It’s a practical primer that begs to come into the kitchen—and won’t disappoint once you get it there.”

 
“An exuberant, engaging approach to vegetables. . . . is a joy. . . . [It] manages to feel comprehensive without sacrificing delight and humor.”

 
“The most exciting approach to home cooking I’ve seen all year. . . . is one of the most satisfying cookbooks I’ve purchased in years, and McFadden’s insights into seasoning are invaluable, even for an experienced home cook.”

 
“A must-have cookbook that stands out from the crowd of vegetable-centric cookbooks. . . . This cookbook deserves to become a well-thumbed, vital addition to any kitchen.”

 
“Essential techniques that can help cooks become better at preparing seasonal and local vegetables. . . . Attractive vegetable recipes range from brightly colored raw and cooked salads to indulgent appetizers, pastas, and baked goods. Under McFadden’s tutelage, cooks will learn how to bring out the best in every humble vegetable.”

 
“McFadden’s debut cookbook is an invaluable resource for all things veggie.”

 
“Visionary. . . . Beautifully produced.”

 
“Glorious.”

 
“This is not a cookbook for coffee tables or artfully curated bookshelves! Its recipes demand to be tasted until the pages are dog-eared and sauce-splattered and stick together. Compulsory for the home cook.”

 
“Joshua McFadden has the soul of a farmer, and his recipes are beautifully in tune with the seasons and the land.”

 
“Joshua [understands] vegetables from the perspective of both a farmer and chef. His mouthwatering and terrific solutions . . . get the most out of vegetables from their beginning to their last act on our plates.”

 
“We always knew Joshua was a vegetable magician, but this is so much more. We learned something new on every page. is a brilliant cookbook.”

Published by Simon & Schuster,2010, Binding: Paperback Reprint Edition",156167,"Amazon.com Review
When Molly Wizenberg's father died of cancer, everyone told her to go easy on herself, to hold off on making any major decisions for a while. But when she tried going back to her apartment in Seattle and returning to graduate school, she knew it wasn't possible to resume life as though nothing had happened. So she went to Paris, a city that held vivid memories of a childhood trip with her father, of early morning walks on the cobbled streets of the Latin Quarter and the taste of her first pain au chocolat. She was supposed to be doing research for her dissertation, but more often, she found herself peering through the windows of chocolate shops, trekking across town to try a new pâtisserie, or tasting cheeses at outdoor markets, until one evening when she sat in the Luxembourg Gardens reading cookbooks until it was too dark to see, she realized that her heart was not in her studies but in the kitchen.
At first, it wasn't clear where this epiphany might lead. Like her long letters home describing the details of every meal and market, Molly's blog Orangette started out merely as a pleasant pastime. But it wasn't long before her writing and recipes developed an international following. Every week, devoted readers logged on to find out what Molly was cooking, eating, reading, and thinking, and it seemed she had finally found her passion. But the story wasn't over: one reader in particular, a curly-haired, food-loving composer from New York, found himself enchanted by the redhead in Seattle, and their email correspondence blossomed into a long-distance romance.
In A Homemade Life: Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table, Molly Wizenberg recounts a life with the kitchen at its center. From her mother's pound cake, a staple of summer picnics during her childhood in Oklahoma, to the eggs she cooked for her father during the weeks before his death, food and memories are intimately entwined. You won't be able to decide whether to curl up and sink into the story or to head straight to the market to fill your basket with ingredients for Cider-Glazed Salmon and Pistachio Cake with Honeyed Apricots.

“Joan of Arc and Madame Clicquot were the two women heroes I knew when growing up in France. What a gift to have this new, well-researched biography of one of the world’s first ‘legitimate’ businesswoman, our contemporary as a global business leader.” (Mireille Guiliano, author of the New York Times #1 bestseller, French Women Don't Get Fat)

“The Widow Clicquot is someone we should all know about.... Long a shadowy, legend-obscured figure, in Tilar Mazzeo’s agile hands the widow sheds her weeds and takes form before our eyes as a distinctly modern entrepreneur....The result is narrative history that fizzes with life and feeling.” (Benjamin Wallace, author of the New York Times bestseller, The Billionaire's Vinegar)

“Told in a light and graceful style that is just right for its subject…. [I]t’s a fascinating trip, made even more so by Ms. Mazzeo’s charming cameo appearances as a kind of tour guide…. This example of Barbe-Nicole’s voice is exceptional…an intoxicating business biography.” (Julia Flynn Siler, The Wall Street Journal)

“The Widow Clicquot, Tilar J. Mazzeo’s sweeping oenobiography of Barbe-Nicole Clicquot Ponsardin, is the story of a woman who was a smashing success long before anyone conceptualized the glass ceiling.” (New York Times Book Review)

“If you like champagne, “The Widow Clicquot” by Tilar J. Mazzeo is definitely worth a drink.” (Lisa Ko, author of The Leavers)

“This book is full of fascinating morsels of information.” (Canberra Times)

The Widow Clicquot is a miraculous feat of organization, one worthy of a doctoral thesis…. [I]n its moments of action, this is actually a gripping story. And while the book appears to be a feminist history/business biography, it’s also the appealing story of the author’s odyssey. (Austin Chronicle)

With The Way to Cook, Julia Child creates a second culinary classic. Her first, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, introduced a generation of those used to preparing simple fare to what was then considered gourmet food, demystified classic techniques, and raised our culinary consciousness. In The Way to Cook, she also demystifies cooking techniques and does some consciousness-raising. This time, though, she speaks to everyone with little or no experience in the kitchen, which is most people these days. Always in tune with the moment, and ever the gracious realist, Child (although calling her Julia seems reasonable since she treats us with such open informality) explains in The Way to Cook how to boil an egg and stuff it, as well as how to make a perfect omelet and an elegant soufflé.
To help out readers who lack the most basic knowledge, she organizes the book by techniques rather than by ingredients. Soups are first, a relatively unintimidating choice to build confidence through delicious results such as true French Onion Soup and a contemporary Black Bean Gazpacho. Next come breads, updated to use a food processor to cut the kneading time. The fish chapter covers broiling a salmon steak and creating a sophisticated Crown Mousse of Trout. Chapters on poultry, meats, vegetables, and desserts are equally ample and wide-ranging.
When The Way to Cook was published in 1989, it accompanied a television series. A related set of videotapes, the first to teach cooking comprehensively, was offered simultaneously. However, more than 600 color photos in this book make it fully complete on its own.
The Way to Cook is a good reference volume, a useful gift, and a handsome way to follow Julia's career as she transformed from a French classicist to the ever-evolving, always clear and reliable teacher we have come to adore. --Dana Jacobi
From Publishers Weekly
Child's new magnum opus reminds us that she has almost single-handedly inspired the superb quality of modern larders. Without her unflagging commitment to good eating, it is doubtful that fresh duck foie gras would have been available for the saute included here. However, this wonderful book is hardly a paean to elitist fare, maintaining Child's unique perspective while reflecting attitudes about food that ""have changed through these last years"" and sharing much new knowledge. Recipes, divided into a master formula and variations, are grouped by technique; French classics stand fin-to-wing with American offerings (roast turkey). Dietary concerns are addressed with low-fat soups and a cottage cheese-enriched chicken liver mousse. Nevertheless, the author of Mastering the Art of French Cooking, who would ""rather swoon over . . . one small serving of chocolate mousse . . . than indulge one . . . fat-free gelatin puddings,"" has not gone light. Six hundred handsome photographs underscore Child's technical genius. 110,000 first printing; BOMC main selection.

One-dish meals are perennially popular on American tables, and books devoted to one-dish cooking perform well. Robin Robertson's One-Dish Vegan is the first book at the intersection of these two powerful cookbook categories. Robin Robertson has built a publishing record of very successful titles in the vegetarian category. She is known for her creativity in the kitchen, for the breadth of enticing ingredients and flavors with which she works, and for her expertise in vegetarian nutrition - with a special focus lately on how vegans still can get enough protein in their diets. Typically, it takes two or three courses or dishes to make a well-rounded vegan meal. To meet this criterion in one dish takes the kind of ingenuity and expert knowledge that Robertson possesses. One-Dish Vegan contains more than 150 recipes. They range from the most popular categories of one-dish dining like stews, chilis, and casseroles (and other baked dishes) to a host of stovetop sautÃ©s and stir-fries as well as substantial salads and dishes that feature pasta as well as other noodles, such as Asian noodles. The recipes are at once homey and adventuresome, comforting and surprising. Above all, they demonstrate that it really is possible to get a complete vegan meal into one dish, full of good-for-you nutrients and bright, satisfying flavors.",109278,"From Booklist
Vegans have just as much need for soups and casseroles as any other eaters, dishes a cook can prepare ahead and that can serve for lunches at desks, for fast leftover meals, and for freezing against another day’s dinner. Robertson exhibits imagination and experience in her recipes’ design and execution. As do so many expert cooks, Robertson commences with stock—in this case, simple vegetable stock, which can add lots of flavor to many different dishes, not just to soups. Ethnic cuisines contribute intriguing variations on lasagna and even popular pad Thai. She devotes an entire chapter to chili. Certain ingredients appear frequently, especially chickpeas. But Robertson covers plenty of other beans and similar protein sources to help ensure balanced nutrition. Specialty items, such as nutritional yeast, appear sparingly. Those with particular food sensitivities will appreciate her noting which recipes avoid allergens like gluten and soy. --Mark Knoblauch

INTRODUCTION 

About the Recipes 

I’ve developed all of the recipes in this book with optimum nutrition, flavor, and speed in mind. They call for easy-to-find, real-food ingredients that maximize your vitamin and mineral intake, while also taking calories into account, in case weight loss is one of your goals, too. 

To make each meal as healthy as possible, I’ve included a generous serving of vegetables in every recipe. If you or someone you’re cooking for isn’t a vegetable lover (yet), the Instant Pot actually offers an advantage. Because pressure cooking tends to turn vegetables to mush if you cook them for too long, it’s easy to sneak vegetables into your meals in unexpected ways. For example, rather than using a lot of heavy cream and an expensive blender to make a cream sauce, you can totally dissolve a head of cauliflower to create a creamy mac ’n’ cheese sauce. And when you cook sweet potatoes in the same pot as the chocolate cake, the potatoes become a soft and creamy base for a rich, chocolate frosting to top the cake. Vegetables have never tasted so good! 

If you have special dietary needs beyond just wanting to eat healthier, this book arms you with plenty of options. I’ve included gluten-free options for every single recipe that contains gluten, without the need for special gluten-free flour mixes, and all recipes are naturally sweetened (meaning there’s no refined sugar) to help keep your blood sugar levels balanced, too. 

If you follow a vegan or vegetarian diet, almost every recipe that calls for meat or fish also has a tested vegan substitute so you won’t miss out on any delicious flavors. Nearly every sauce in the book is already vegan, so you can easily swap the protein to suit your needs, or use up any ingredients that you have on hand. If you eat meat, try one of the meatless variations every now and then. It adds variety to your diet and helps you cut back on your weekly grocery bills.

Since dairy products can cause digestive issues for many people, I’ve also limited the use of dairy in these recipes. If you’re in this camp, feel free to omit cheese when it is called for in a recipe, or use the vegan variations for a totally dairy-free dish.

No matter what your dietary needs are, you’ll find plenty of healthy recipes to enjoy in this collection. To help you get started, I’ve included a list of my favorite pantry staples and kitchen tools to make shopping and cooking easier. If some of the ingredients in these recipes are unfamiliar, take a look at the ingredients and substitutions section for some simple swaps. And if you’ve never used an Instant Pot before, check out my easy reference guide. It walks you through the operation of your pressure cooker and helps you troubleshoot the most common problems.

 Let’s get started!

For millennia, fresh olive oil has been one of life’s necessities―not just as food but also as medicine, a beauty aid, and a vital element of religious rituals. But this symbol of purity has become deeply corrupt. A superbly crafted combination of cultural history and food manifesto, Extra Virginity takes us on a journey through the world of olive oil, opening our eyes to olive oil’s rich past as well as to the fierce contemporary struggle between oil fraudsters of the globalized food industry and artisan producers whose oil truly deserves the name ""extra virgin.""

“Tom Mueller is, in turn, chemist, explorer, scholar and bard, infusing the narrative with a sense of wonder.”
- Times Literary Supplement

“In covering an industry that has its heroes and villains, author Tom Mueller does a splendid job of sorting out the players and demystifying the product.”
- Russ Parsons, Los Angeles Times

“Extra Virginity may make you reconsider the extra you’re paying for 'extra.'”
- Cynthia Crossen, Wall Street Journal

“Passionately written yet clear-headed…Mueller builds a convincing case for olive oil as one of the most miraculous and versatile substances in all of nature.”
- Jerry Shriver, USA Today

“Mueller does for his subject what Susan Orlean did for orchids.”
- Columbus Dispatch

“[Extra Virginity] does for olive oil what Eric Schlosser’s Fast Food Nation did for hamburgers. Mueller traces the history of this valuable product from antiquity to the present, but the really disturbing part is his exposé of the inferior quality control and outright fraud among today’s oil producers.”

""To whom the fat rolls…I'm tired of books where a self-loathing heroine is teased to the point where she starves herself skinny in hopes of a fabulous new life. And I hate the message that women can't possibly be happy until we all fit into our skinny jeans. I don't find these stories uplifting; they make me want to hug these women and take them out for fizzy champagne drinks and cheesecake and explain to them that until they figure out their insides, their outsides don't matter. Unfortunately, being overweight isn't simply a societal issue that can be fixed with a dose healthy of positive self-esteem. It’s a health matter, and here on the eve of my fortieth year, I've learned I have to make changes so I don't, you know, die.

The fascinating untold tale of Samuel Zemurray, the self-made banana mogul who went from penniless roadside banana peddler to kingmaker and capitalist revolutionary

When Samuel Zemurray arrived in America in 1891, he was tall, gangly, and penniless. When he died in the grandest house in New Orleans sixty-nine years later, he was among the richest, most powerful men in the world. Working his way up from a roadside fruit peddler to conquering the United Fruit Company, Zemurray became a symbol of the best and worst of the United States: proof that America is the land of opportunity, but also a classic example of the corporate pirate who treats foreign nations as the backdrop for his adventures.
Zemurray lived one of the great untold stories of the last hundred years. Starting with nothing but a cart of freckled bananas, he built a sprawling empire of banana cowboys, mercenary soldiers, Honduran peasants, CIA agents, and American statesmen. From hustling on the docks of New Orleans to overthrowing Central American governments and precipitating the bloody thirty-six-year Guatemalan civil war, the Banana Man lived a monumental and sometimes dastardly life. Rich Cohen's brilliant historical profile The Fish That Ate the Whale unveils Zemurray as a hidden power broker, driven by an indomitable will to succeed.",25158,"Review
“Rich Cohen books constitute a genre unto themselves: pungent, breezy, vividly written psychodramas.” ―The New York Times Book Review
“Lively and entertaining.” ―The Boston Globe
“This biography of the complex and often contradictory figure of Zemurray is Cohen's most engaging and entertaining book to date.” ―Chicago Tribune Printers Row Journal
“This is a rollicking but brilliantly researched book about one of the most fascinating characters of the twentieth century. I grew up in New Orleans enthralled by tales of Sam Zemurray, the banana peddler who built United Fruit. This book recounts, with delightful verve, his military and diplomatic maneuvers in Central America and his colorful life and business practices.” ―Walter Isaacson, president and CEO of the Aspen Institute and author of Steve Jobs
“Sam ‘the Banana Man' Zemurray was a larger-than-life character. Rich Cohen is a superb storyteller. Put them together and you have a startling and often hilarious account of one of the forgotten heroes (and villains) of the American empire.” ―Zev Chafets
“In Rich Cohen's masterful and enthralling narrative, one man's character is not simply his fate but also that of a nation. With verve, wit, and page-turning excitement, The Fish That Ate the Whale unfolds as compelling story of bold success coupled with reckless ambition. I loved this book.” ―Howard Blum, author of The Floor of Heaven and American Lightning

The Weight of the Union

Let's face it: America has become a hefty nation. About two-thirds, or 66 percent, of us have been classified by health officials as overweight or obese. In the late '80s and early '90s, that statistic was 56 percent. In the late '70s, it was more like 47 percent. The numbers show a dramatic increase. Even more disturbing is the fact that about one-third of our children and teens are overweight or obese--triple the rate of their parents' and grandparents' generations. Doctors are diagnosing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes in elementary school kids and, in some cases, predicting shorter life spans for them than their parents for the first time ever. What we eat today has an impact not only on our future, but on the future of our children. Trainers Bob Harper and Jillian Michaels on The Biggest Loser always shake their heads at the amount of fast food their contestants--and their families--are used to eating before they arrive at the ranch. ""It's super-size this and super- size that,"" observes Harper, ""with the result that portion sizes are out of control as well.""

So how can you protect your family from our national health crisis? Two words: family meals. The demise of the once-hallowed ritual of family mealtime is emerging as a factor, say researchers, in this country's obesity epidemic. Studies indicate that dinnertime is the perfect opportunity to introduce healthy foods into your family's diet and to involve family members (that includes the kids!) in food choices, preparation, and cooking. But we're talking about more than just food. It's also a perfect time for family members to slow down and talk to each other. Parents might actually find out what's going on in their teenagers' lives! And when the dinner table is an enjoyable place--in terms of both food and environment--big strides can be made for the health of everyone sitting around it.

If family mealtime isn't already a part of your day, try to work it into your family's schedule so that it becomes a priority. Like soccer practice or day care, it will soon become an integral part of your day, and something you won't skip. If the kids are reluctant at first, start small. Gradually introducing change makes it easier for them to adjust. Start by filling everyone's drinking glass with water or skim milk instead of soda. Or turning off the TV during meals. And try to get your kids involved! Don't just put down a plate of food in front of them and say, ""Eat it."" Let them be involved in the shopping and meal preparation, and they might even try a few new vegetables.

We've witnessed firsthand the powerful influence of family on Season 6 of The Biggest Loser. Vicky and Brady Vilcan came to the ranch from Louisiana, worried about their weight but heartbroken about the example they were setting for their children, especially their daughter, who weighed 63 £ds at the age of 4. ""I feel 100 percent responsible for my daughter. She's overweight, and I know it's because of me,"" said Vicky.

But after the Vilcans committed to a healthy way of life at the ranch, things changed. ""Before my experience at The Biggest Loser ranch,"" said Brady, ""We often ate whenever and wherever we felt like. Ninety percent of the time, we ate at a restaurant or took home takeout. Now I spend a lot of time planning what to get from the grocery store to prepare at home. The first thing I do at mealtime is turn off the television. Mealtime is now family time, where we all sit together at the same time and share thoughts about the day.""

Frustratingly, eating healthfully these days doesn't always come cheap. Even the cost of basic staples such as bread, milk, and eggs has climbed significantly--not to mention the price of produce and other wholesome foods. A trip to the grocery store has become an exercise in sticker shock, while the low prices of many unhealthful, processed foods and fast foods has remained relatively stable.

Once The Biggest Losers leave the ranch and re-enter the real world, they're struggling with the same budgetary issues as the rest of us. But, as you'll see throughout this book, there's hope! ""We have found that since we're not eating out like we used to, we actually have more money to spend on good, healthy food,"" says Stacey Capers, another Season 6 member. ""So we've moved the 'dining out' part of our budget over to groceries. And we're always on the lookout for a good sale!"" Cooking and eating at home not only ensures that you're eating healthy, nutritious foods--it also helps you save money.

Coleen Skeabeck of Season 6 adds, ""For me, getting the best deal possible and not breaking the bank is so important. I shop at a local farmers' market to get the best prices on produce instead of buying it at the grocery store. As for the other groceries, I plan out what I'd like to eat for the next week or so and then buy only what I need instead of throwing a bunch of items in my cart. And although sometimes it takes a minute to flip through the ads, finding items you need that may be on sale really helps!""

So, how to prepare the best food at the best prices? To that end, Chef Devin Alexander has come up with more than 125 recipes specifically crafted to keep your wallet--and your family--healthy. These are true crowd- pleasing recipes that will get everyone in the kitchen and satisfy even the pickiest tastebuds. Since food prices vary across the country (groceries tend to be cheaper in the Midwest and more expensive in major metropolitan areas and on the East and West coasts), we've come up with recipe items that would fit a weekly food budget of $175 to $215 for a family of four. For more information on the cost of groceries around the country, visit one of the Web sites listed in Resources on page 215.

There are no hard-and-fast rules when it comes to these recipes, and there's plenty of room to adjust for your family's budget and tastes. If a recipe calls for fresh vegetables but frozen are on sale at your local grocery store, go for what works best for you. Also, take advantage of your regional specialties. If you're in central Pennsylvania, for example, an area known for its farms and dairy cattle, milk and produce will be cheaper. On the West Coast, you may find better deals on salmon than the rest of us. And if you live in Florida, you'll have much cheaper access to citrus fruits than folks elsewhere in the country. It all depends on where the product originates and what your family likes. For more information about what's in season where you live, check out the Web sites listed in Resources on page 215.

Put yourself in control. The idea here is to have fun, eat well, and enjoy your family--all without going broke!

Watch Your Wallet

You'll find budget shopping tips throughout this book, but here are a few hard-core essentials that will get you started on the right foot.

* Make a list and don't leave home without it! Plan your meals in advance, itemize what you need, and stick to it. That way you can avoid the potato chip aisle.

* Buy less-expensive store brands or try warehouse or discount stores.

* Stock up on sale items that are nonperishable, such as canned goods.

* Don't forget the lowly bean! It offers great nutrition at a bargain price.

* Shop the outer aisles of the grocery store. That's where you'll find fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and fat-free dairy products. The inner aisles contain most of the processed, less healthy stuff.

* Always check the unit pricing on an item, not just the total price, to make sure you're getting the best deal. The best savings aren't always on the largest quantity

* Study the store circulars carefully to make sure you're getting a real discount. Sometimes manufacturers pay to have an item included in the circular, so compare weekly specials to the non-""special"" brands to find the best deal.

* Don't always buy the items on display at eye level. Cheaper items are usually on the bottom shelf, and not at the ends of aisles.

* If you enjoy cooking with fresh herbs, investing in a small window box filled with your favorites is a good option. You'll always have fresh herbs at your fingertips. To keep herbs that grow quickly from going to seed, clip and freeze as needed. Here's how: Wash and finely chop the herbs, then fill the sections of an ice cube tray about halfway with the herb pieces. Cover the herbs with water, pop the tray in the freezer, and freeze until solid. Once cubes are formed, transfer your ""herb ice cubes"" to an airtight container and store it in the freezer. Add the cubes while preparing moist recipes such as hot soups, stews, and sauces.

Curry is Grilled Chicken with Cashew-Tomato Sauce. Curry is Asparagus with Tomato and Crumbled Paneer. Curry is Lamb with Yellow Split Peas, Chunky Potatoes with Spinach, Tamarind Shrimp with Coconut Milk, Baby Back Ribs with a Sweet-Sour Glaze and Vinegar Sauce, Basmati Rice with Fragrant Curry Leaves. Curry is vivid flavors, seasonal ingredients, a kaleidoscope of spices and unexpected combinations. And 660 Curries is the gateway to the world of Indian cooking, demystifying one of the world's great cuisines.

Presented by the IACP award–winning Cooking Teacher of the Year (2004), Raghavan Iyer, 660 Curries is a joyous food-lover's extravaganza. Mr. Iyer first grounds us in the building blocks of Indian flavors—the interplay of sour (like tomatoes or yogurt), salty, sweet, pungent (peppercorns, chiles), bitter, and the quality of unami (seeds, coconuts, and the like). Then, from this basic palette, he unveils an infinite art. There are appetizers—Spinach Fritters, Lentil Dumplings in a Buttermilk Coconut Sauce—and main courses—Chicken with Lemongrass and Kaffir-Lime Leaves, Lamb Loin Chops with an Apricot Sauce. Cheese dishes—Pan-Fried Cheese with Cauliflower and Cilantro; bean dishes—Lentil Stew with Cumin and Cayenne. And hundreds of vegetable dishes—Sweet Corn with Cumin and Chiles, Chunky Potatoes with Golden Raisins, Baby Eggplant Stuffed with Cashew Nuts and Spices. There are traditional, regional curries from around the subcontinent and contemporary curries. Plus all the extras: biryanis, breads, rice dishes, raitas, spice pastes and blends, and rubs.

Iyer (The Turmeric Trail) makes the enormous spectrum of Indian curry dishes enticing and accessible in this hefty tome, bound to be a must-have for lovers of Indian cuisine. Cooks already familiar with this food will be inspired as they cook through its pages. The term curry encompasses a vast range of dishes, and Iyer has uncovered the best from the subcontinent's many regions and cultures, working his way from Goa (chicken in coconut milk sauce) to Kashmir (hearty braised lamb shanks in broth), Calcutta (tilapia in yogurt sauce), Kerala (spinach in pigeon pea-coconut sauce), and everywhere between. The largest chapter features an extraordinary selection of curries using India's rainbow of legumes, but Iyer includes meat, cheese, fish and vegetable curries, plus appetizers and snacks, biryanis and elegant rice variations and breads. Access to a well-stocked Indian grocery is vital, but past that hurdle Iyer makes the recipes quite approachable thanks to his chatty introductions, many thoughtful preparation tips and helpful ingredient glossary.

“Get ready to be hunger-free and skinny in no time!”—Woman’s World magazine
From the Inside Flap
For years we've been told that a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet is the way to lose weight and stay trim. But anyone who has diligently followed that regimen knows that it doesn't work. Rick Gallop, former president of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario, tried it, along with countless other diets, and ended up back where he started: twenty pounds overweight. Frustrated, he set out to find a diet that was healthy and that would actually work. When he came across the Glycemic Index, or G.I., he realized he'd found the magic bullet.
Developed by Dr. David Jenkins, a professor of nutrition at the University of Toronto, the G.I. measures the speed at which your body breaks down food and converts it to glucose, which is used for energy or stored as fat. When losing weight, it is critical to avoid foods that have a high G.I., because they are digested too quickly by your body. With Rick Gallop's ""G.I. Diet you won't have to calculate the glycemic ratings and calories because he has done that for you, by listing foods in one of three categories: foods to avoid, foods to eat occasionally, and foods that you can eat as much of as you want.
With recipes, snack ideas, a pull-out shopping list, tips on dining out and strategies for maintaining your new weight, you'll never have to pick up another diet book!

Introduction
 
ve·gan ston·er [vee-guhn stoh-ner] — noun: one who satisfies the munchies with resourceful, creative, instinctive cooking without using animal products.

These recipes are designed to make vegan cooking fun, feasible, quick, and on a dime. Each recipe—for a sauce, a stuffing, or a base—is a potential component in your personal munchie menu. Mix and match with confidence. Substitute ingredients and flavors to personalize dishes for you, for two, or for a party. Explore the depths of your creativity. 

There will be moments when you will be in doubt. Trust yourself, dig in with your fingers, and grab what feels right. Pay attention to consistency, texture, smell, and, most importantly, your taste buds. In time you will rely less on exact measurements and more on instinct.   

Don’t be afraid to go where no one in your kitchen has gone before. Cook for yourself, and know that the only success in cooking is when you have fun.","['easy to follow', 'vegan stoner', 'super easy', 'wait to try', 'banana dog', 'easy to make', 'highly recommend', 'adorable illustrations', 'favorite cookbook', 'every recipe', 'sour cream', 'recipes are easy', 'illustrations are cute', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Whether you have burgers, steak, ribs, or roast chicken on the menu shopping for and cooking meat can be confusing, and mistakes can be costly. After 20-plus years of purchasing and cooking beef, pork, lamb, veal, chicken, and turkey, the editors of Cook’s Illustrated understand that preparing meat doesn’t start at the stove it starts at the store.

The Cook’s Illustrated Meat Book begins with a 27-page master class in meat cookery, which covers shopping (what’s the difference between natural and organic labels?), storing (just how long should you really refrigerate meat and does the duration vary if the meat is cooked or raw?), and seasoning meat (marinating, salting, and brining).

Matching cut to cooking method is another key to success, so our guide includes fully illustrated pages devoted to all of the major cooking methods: sautéing, pan-searing, pan-roasting, roasting, grilling, barbecuing, and more. We identify the best cuts for these methods and explain point by point how and why you should follow our steps and what may happen if you don’t.

425 Bulletproof and rigorously tested recipes for beef, pork, lamb, veal, and poultry provide plenty of options for everyday meals and special occasion dinners and you’ll learn new and better ways to cook favorites such as Pan-Seared Thick-Cut Steak, Juicy Pub-Style Burgers, Weeknight Roast Chicken, Barbecued Pulled Pork, and more.

The Cook’s Illustrated Meat Book also includes equipment recommendations (what should you look for in a good roasting pan and is it worth spending extra bucks on a pricey nonstick skillet?). In addition, hundreds of step-by-step illustrations guide you through our core techniques so whether you’re slicing a chicken breast into cutlets or getting ready to carve prime rib the Cook’s Illustrated Meat Book covers all the bases",33805,,"About the Author

From the Author
I grew up in the Southeast, namely North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, where pound cake is pretty much the regional cake. And pound cake is best when baked in a deep bundt pan--it gives it just the right density. The word ""bundt"" also loosely translates in German as ""gathering."" And because I'm a community builder by nature, (and I did it for 10 years working in local government), bundt cake is my vehicle for bringing people together. Thank you for sharing my recipes and stories. I hope the recipes in this book help you build your community with the shared love of a homemade cake.

INTRODUCTION

Yes! You finally bought an air fryer! Perhaps you don’t know what to make with it or exactly how to use it. Not to worry. Be prepared to become an air fryer aficionado!

If it weren’t for the constant emails from Skinnytaste fans asking me for air fryer recipes, I probably wouldn’t have discovered what all the fuss was about. I resisted buying an air fryer for quite a while because I really didn’t want another gadget or cooking appliance taking up space in my kitchen. My thought was, What can the air fryer do that I can’t do with my oven? I admit I was skeptical. The first recipe I tested was my Buttermilk Oven “Fried” Chicken from my first cookbook, The Skinnytaste Cookbook. The recipe came out perfectly crispy—golden chicken that was juicy and perfectly cooked on the inside—and in half the time it would have taken in the oven. I was amazed. 

I started testing all my fried favorites—french fries, chicken wings, onion rings, breaded chicken cutlets. I was really impressed! Food came out so much crispier than I could achieve in my oven. And many times, I even had my husband fooled that it wasn’t fried. Needless to say, I was a convert.

Suddenly it became a fun challenge trying everything I could think of in my new appliance. Roasted vegetables won me over. Charred string beans, roasted Brussels sprouts, and crisp cauliflower came out perfectly browned—exactly the way I love them. Then I started playing around with salmon, lamb chops, burgers, bagels, and even pizza. I was hooked! There are so many positives: The air fryer takes only three minutes to preheat, doesn’t heat up the kitchen, is safer and healthier than deep frying, and doesn’t smoke up the whole house. 

This easy, useful kitchen appliance has now replaced my oven on most weekdays and -nights, whether I’m whipping up a side dish, heating up leftovers, or making supper. In fact, I love it so much that I decided to brand my own and create my first product: the Skinnytaste by Vremi Air Fryer. You may be overwhelmed with the options of air fryer models available on the market, from basket-style (like mine), to toaster oven–style (such as the Cuisinart Air Fryer Toaster Oven or the Breville Smart Oven Air). The good news: All the recipes in this book will work for any model. I’ve included directions for both styles, and I’ve added cook times for a conventional oven for those of you who have no desire to purchase an air fryer (see chart on page 155). 

There’s plenty of air fryer cookbooks out there, but they’re not necessarily healthy or light, so I knew a Skinnytaste air fryer cookbook had to be written. Each recipe includes nutrition information as well as a recipe key labeling recipes that are at or under thirty minutes in cook time, vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free, ketofriendly, and freezer-friendly.

I hope this book and an air fryer itself will inspire you in the kitchen. Have fun with the appliance, and be prepared to fall in love. I guarantee you’ll find ways to use it in everyday cooking. 


Be prepared to get your fingers messy! Not only are these Buffalo wings flavorful, but they’ll also save you a ton of calories (thanks to the air fryer) compared with your average deep-fried, greasy, restaurant version. The simple, cooling blue cheese dip is made with Greek yogurt and is also perfect for dipping celery and carrot sticks.


12 pieces (26 ounces) chicken wing portions (a mix of drumettes and wingettes)
6 tablespoons Frank’s RedHot sauce
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt


1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
1/3 cup 2% Greek yogurt
1/2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/2 tablespoon distilled white vinegar

2 celery stalks, halved crosswise and cut into 8 sticks total
2 medium carrots, peeled, halved crosswise and cut into 8 sticks total

In a large bowl, combine the chicken with 1 tablespoon of the hot sauce, the vinegar, oregano, garlic powder, and salt, tossing to coat well.

In a small bowl, mash the blue cheese and yogurt together with a fork. Stir in the lemon juice and vinegar until well blended. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

Preheat the air fryer to 400°F.

Working in batches, arrange a single layer of the chicken in the air fryer basket. Cook for 22 minutes, flipping halfway, until crispy, browned, and cooked through. (For a toaster oven–style air fryer, the temperature remains the same; cook for 15 to 16 minutes.) Transfer to a large clean bowl (do not use the bowl the marinade was in). When all the batches are done, return all the chicken to the air fryer and cook for 1 minute to heat through.

Return the chicken to the bowl and toss with the remaining 5 tablespoons hot sauce to coat. Arrange on a platter and serve with the celery, carrot sticks, and blue cheese dip.


To prep the wings ahead of time, you can marinate the chicken and make the dip the night before.

—Steven Rinella, author of American Buffalo and Meat Eater

“You don’t have to be a hunter to want to cook duck and goose. Thankfully, Hank Shaw has demystified these birds for all to enjoy!”
—Chris Cosentino, chef-owner of Incanto and winner of Top Chef Masters

“Throughout history in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, the tasty, sustainable, and versatile duck has satisfied many happy diners. Whether you want to know the difference in taste between certain species or even how to make a duck hot dog, Hank’s book is a perfectly thorough guide on everything you need to know about preparing duck.” 
—Daniel Boulud, chef, restaurateur, and author of Braise

“Hank Shaw has produced a kind of ‘ultimate cookbook,’ which I found utterly fascinating. Here is everything you will ever need to know about ducks and geese, how to hunt them in the supermarket or in the marsh, and how to cook them.”
 —Paula Wolfert, author of The Cooking of Southwest France and Mediterranean Cooking

“In my universe there is no bigger star than Hank Shaw. Passionate and learned, his writing provides the inspiration for those who don’t live the outdoors lifestyle to be in the field and on the water. His recipes teach even the most expert cook how to use the right techniques for handling waterfowl in the kitchen and his wit and wisdom make a superb read. With Holly Heyser’s beautiful and practical imagery, this book delivers on its promise to make us all more competent cooks.”
—Andrew Zimmern, host of and

“I grew up among avid duck hunters and have enjoyed many meals  of teal, mallards, and other wild ducks, and as a chef I’ve worked with every kind of domesticated duck. It’s no secret that duck is one of my favorite things to cook. I love that this book exists! I hope it will inspire many more cooks to explore the wonderful flavor of wild and domesticated ducks.”
—Traci des Jardins, James Beard Award-winning chef and owner of Jardinière

If your acquaintance with water fowl is limited to Peking duck and Christmas goose, then, welcome, because you're holding an invitation to a remarkable world of cooking. Hank Shaw's recipes, along with his inimitable prose, lure you into the kitchen, encouraging you to cook everything from whole birds to giblets; dishes smoked and drunken; Chinese, French, Laotian, and German; crispy and braised. Shaw's passion is so infectious, his knowledge so commanding, is more than a cookbook. It's a culinary field guide to dishes delightfully exotic to comfortingly familiar.

This book also explores einkorn’s history, unique genetics, and superior nutrient content, while sharing Carla’s tips for using it to its full baking and cooking potential.

Review
“A Kitchen in France…encourages us to cook together and share good food and wine with people we love.”
--The Wall Street Journal
 
“This highly personal and friendly book encourages readers to really appreciate ingredients, and time spent in the kitchen and at the table.”
--Cherry Bombe

“Equally enthralling as her recipes is Thorisson’s seemingly effortless conjuring of a rustic dream life, often exquisitely illustrated by her husband’s photography…”
—Vogue

“If you’ve ever read Mimi Thorisson’s blog, Manger, you know what it is to envy her life, full of long walks through the French countryside with her children and seeming endless brigade of dogs, which end at home with bushels full of produce that she effortlessly turns into feasts, all cassoulets and tarts and roasts and good wine to wash it all down. But if you’re going to buy one aspirational cookbook this fall, it’s Mimi’s—because you’ll actually take on many of her recipes, and absorb a bit of her style of entertaining in the process.”
—Food52.com

“Mimi Thorisson’s picture-perfect life would almost be too idyllic to bear if she weren’t so generous: This lovely home cook willingly shares culinary secrets in her popular blog of two and a half years, Manger, along with a host of classic French recipes in a brand-new cookbook, A Kitchen in France.

We know whole grain breads are better for us, but will we actually eat them, much less take time to bake them?

Yes, says beloved baking instructor Peter Reinhart, but only if they are very, very good. So Reinhart, with his decades of experience crafting amazing artisanal breads, has made it his mission to create whole grain breads that are nothing short of incredible.

And because his approach is also simpler and less labor intensive than conventional techniques, you’ll choose to make and eat these breads. His fifty-five recipes for whole grain sandwich, hearth, and specialty breads, plus bagels, crackers, and more, incorporate widely available whole wheat flour as well as other flours and grains such as rye, barley, steel-cut oats, cornmeal, and quinoa. Each is so rich with flavor and satisfying texture that white-flour counterparts pale in comparison.

Written in Reinhart’s famously clear style and accompanied by inspiring photographs, these recipes were perfected with the help of nearly 350 testers. Introductory chapters provide a tutorial, with step-by-step photographs, of the delayed fermentation method that is at the heart of these recipes, as well as a crash course in baking science, discussions of grains other than wheat, and more. Advanced bakers will relish Reinhart’s innovative techniques and exacting scientific explanations, and beginning bakers will rejoice in the ease of baking wholesome breads with such extraordinary flavor.",52994,"From Publishers Weekly
Bread is back, Reinhart (The Bread Baker's Apprentice) asserts, and it's better than ever after being villainized during the anticarbohydrate diet fads; his manifesto of renewal, this enthusiastic tome featuring the kinds of whole grain breads he sees as the way forward, will be eagerly received by serious bakers. In three useful preliminary chapters, Reinhart describes how he developed the delayed fermentation process that makes these breads delicious as well as wholesome, dissects wheat's route from stalk to loaf and patiently walks through the new technique's theory and process, in order to arm bakers with every bit of information before they start kneading. The level of technical detail and demand for scientific precision may overwhelm amateurs, but anyone with some experience working with bread dough and starters, as well as a desire to get to the next level, will be gratified by Reinhart's intense but friendly approach. In the more than 50 recipes, from a variety of breads including multigrain loaves, whole wheat cinnamon buns, brioche and crispy lavash, Reinhart builds on the first chapters with detailed commentary on ingredients and preparation, encouraging bakers to own the process but never leaving them in the lurch. Whether or not a home baker is looking for healthier recipes, Reinhart's peerless way of writing about bread is sure to inspire a new respect for whole grains. Color photos not seen by PW. (Oct.)

Review
“We’ve always known how good whole grain breads are for us, but we’ve also known how they’re usually heavy, dense, and sort of boring. Now here comes Peter Reinhart, a passionate bread scientist who has figured out fifty-five different ways to make whole grain breads light and delicious. His work is nothing short of revolutionary.”

–Sara Moulton, Food Network host and author of Sara’s Secrets for Weeknight Meals


“No one is better qualified–either as a teacher or as a baker–than Peter Reinhart to tackle the complex subject of whole grain breads. His techniques and recipes are easy to follow and yield excellent results every time. Peter and his breads are the real thing.”

–Nick Malgieri, author of How to Bake and A Baker’s Tour


“Whole Grain Breads is a beautiful and important work, which is no big surprise coming, as it does, from Peter Reinhart. Everything here is a gift: the breads themselves (both described and pictured), the poetic voice, the story, the technique, and the generous spirit. Read this from cover to cover, and you will find yourself looking at all food differently, from a new height and a deeper appreciation.”

–Mollie Katzen, author of


“I’ve spent years following directions from more than a dozen bread baking books. I’ve babied bowls of dough in various stages of fermentation, and I’ve only ended up with bread that tastes like an inner tube. Peter has unraveled the mystery of baking, and I now approach this intimidating subject with confidence.”

–James Peterson, author of


“Peter Reinhart is a gifted teacher who explains the science of bread dough in easy-to-understand language. Using Peter’s innovative techniques for enhancing both enzyme and yeast activity and following with his gentle, clear-cut guidance, even a beginner can master sourdough starters, pre-ferments, soakers, and mashes to make incredibly flavorful whole grain breads.”

“Mixon does an admirable job of showing grillers, smokers, and barbecuers how they can turn labor and time-intensive grilling and barbecue projects into weekday meals with a minimum of fuss in this to-the-point collection of 150 smoke-centered recipes. . . . It’s his ingenious use of leftovers that will make readers take notice as he offers suggestions for mountains of leftover brisket, pulled pork, or chicken.

Today’s optimistic farm-to-table food culture has a dark secret: the local food movement has failed to change how we eat. It has also offered a false promise for the future of food. In his visionary New York Times–bestselling book, chef Dan Barber, recently showcased on Netflix’s Chef’s Table, offers a radical new way of thinking about food that will heal the land and taste good, too. Looking to the detrimental cooking of our past, and the misguided dining of our present, Barber points to a future “third plate”: a new form of American eating where good farming and good food intersect. Barber’s The Third Plate charts a bright path forward for eaters and chefs alike, daring everyone to imagine a future for our national cuisine that is as sustainable as it is delicious.",43378,"Review
The Chicago Tribune
“[A]uthor Dan Barber's tales are engaging, funny and delicious... The Third Plate invites inevitable comparisons with Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma, which Barber invokes more than once. And, indeed, its framework of a foodie seeking truth through visits with sages and personal experiments echoes Pollan's landmark tome (not to mention his passages on wheat cultivation, which, astonishingly, best Pollan's corn cultivation chapters by many pages.) But at the risk of heresy, I would call this The Omnivore's Dilemma 2.0... The Third Plate serves as a brilliant culinary manifesto with a message as obvious as it is overlooked. Promote, grow and eat a diet that's in harmony with the earth and the earth will reward you for it. It's an inspiring message that could truly help save our water, air and land before it's too late.”

The Washington Post
""Not since Michael Pollan has such a powerful storyteller emerged to reform American food.... Barber is helping to write a recipe for the sustainable production of gratifying food.""

Pittsburgh-Post Gazette:
“There hasn’t been a call-to-action book with the potential to change the way we eat since Michael Pollan’s 2006 release, The Omnivore’s Dilemma. Now there is. Dan Barber’s The Third Plate: Field Notes on the Future of Food is a compelling global journey in search of a new understanding about how to build a more sustainable food system….The Third Plate is an argument for good rather than an argument against bad. This recipe might at times be challenging, but what’s served in the end is a dish for a better future….Barber writes a food manifesto for the ages.”


""... reimagines American farm culture not as a romantic return to simpler times but as a smart, modern version of it... is, a mix of food history, environmental philosophy and restaurant lore... an addition to the sustainability discussion.”


“When , Michael Pollan’s now-classic 2006 work, questioned the logic of our nation’s food system, 'local' and 'organic' weren’t ubiquitous the way they are today. . In four sections—'Soil,' 'Land,' 'Sea,' and 'Seed'— outlines how his pursuit of intense flavor repeatedly forced him to look beyond individual ingredients at a region’s broader story—and demonstrates how land, communities, and taste benefit when ecology informs the way we source, cook, and eat.”


""Each grain represents an agricultural virtue: Rye, for example, builds carbon in the soil. Taken together, they , in ... Mr. Barber’s subjects tend to be colorfully eccentric and good talkers, capable of philosophizing by the yard. To put their efforts in context, Mr. Barber unobtrusively weaves in a hefty amount of science and food history..""

“Barber’s work is for a sustainable food chain.”


""Dan Barber’s new book, , is an eloquent and thoughtful look at the current state of our nation’s food system and how it must evolve. Barber’s wide range of experiences, both in and out of the kitchen, provide him with a rare perspective on this pressing issue. A must read.”


“In this compelling read Dan Barber asks questions that nobody else has raised about what it means to be a chef, the nature of taste, and what 'sustainable' really means. He challenges everything you think you know about food; it will change the way you eat. If I could give every cook just one book, this would be the one.”


""Dan Barber is not only a great chef, he's also a fine writer. His vision of a new food system—based on diversity, complexity, and a reverence for nature—isn't utopian. It's essential.""


“I thought it would be impossible for Dan Barber to be as interesting on the page as he is on the plate. I was wrong.”


“ is one of those rare books that's at once deft and searching—deeply serious and equally entertaining. Dan Barber will change the way you look at food.”


""After my first meal at Blue Hill, I paid Dan the ultimate farmer compliment. I told him that he made vegetables taste almost fresher after he had prepared them than when the farmer harvested them. Now I am equally impressed with his writing. Food has stories and Dan tells the stories as well as he cooks. If you want to know about food, read this book.""


“Dan Barber writes with the restrained lushness with which he cooks. In elegant prose, he argues persuasively that eating is our most profound engagement with the non-human world. How we eat makes us who we are and makes the environment what it is. It all needs to change, and Barber has written a provocative manifesto that balances brave originality and meticulous research. His food is farm-to-table; his eloquent, impassioned book is farm-to-heart.""


“Dan Barber is as fine a thinker and writer as he is a chef—which is saying a great deal. This book uses its ingredients—the insights of some of the finest farmers on the planet—to fashion something entirely new: a recipe for the future.”

Captain James Cook's three epic journeys in the 18th century were the last great voyages of discovery. His ships sailed 150,000 miles, from the Artic to the Antarctic, from Tasmania to Oregon, from Easter Island to Siberia. When Cook set off for the Pacific in 1768, a third of the globe remained blank. By the time he died in Hawaii in 1779, the map of the world was substantially complete.
Tony Horwitz vividly recounts Cook's voyages and the exotic scenes the captain encountered: tropical orgies, taboo rituals, cannibal feasts, human sacrifice. He also relives Cook's adventures by following in the captain's wake to places such as Tahiti, Savage Island, and the Great Barrier Reef to discover Cook's embattled legacy in the present day. Signing on as a working crewman aboard a replica of Cook's vessel, Horwitz experiences the thrill and terror of sailing a tall ship. He also explores Cook the man: an impoverished farmboy who broke through the barriers of his class and time to become the greatest navigator in British history.
By turns harrowing and hilarious, insightful and entertaining, BLUE LATITUDES brings to life a man whose voyages helped create the 'global village' we know today.",67545,"Review

Thorough chapters are devoted to nutrition, weight gain, food safety, the postpartum diet, and how to eat when trying to conceive again. And, very exciting, the book comes with 150 contemporary, tasty, and healthy recipes that feed mom and baby well, take little time to prepare, and are gentle on queasy tummies.

Eating Well comes with a light, reader-friendly tone while delivering the most up-to-date information. At the heart of the book are hundreds of pressing questions every mother-to-be has: Is it true I shouldn’t eat any food cooked with alcohol? Will the caffeine in coffee cross into my baby’s bloodstream? Help!—I’m entering my second trimester, and I’m losing weight, not gaining. Is all sushi off limits? How do I get enough calcium if I’m lactose intolerant? I keep dreaming about a hot fudge sundae—can I indulge? Guess what: The answer is yes.",29974,"From Publishers Weekly
For many pregnant women, eating healthy during pregnancy is a catch-22: ""The reason you want to eat healthy is because you're pregnant—and the reason you're having a hard time eating healthy is also because you're pregnant,"" the authors explain. Morning sickness, heartburn, constipation... the list of food-related problems pregnant women can encounter goes on and on. Murkoff (What to Expect When You're Expecting) and coauthor Mazel address these difficulties in a practical manner, with numerous tried-and-true suggestions that will certainly afford some relief for the majority. The ""Pregnancy Diet Daily Dozen"" lists foods that provide all the vitamins, minerals and nutrients mother and child need, followed by recipes that facilitate consumption of the daily dozen. Sidebars examine ""wisdom of the ages"" (myths and old wives' tales that may or may not hold water), and a survey will help expectant mothers evaluate their eating habits and monitor their weight gain. The authors address concerns of pregnant women who are lactose intolerant or vegans, advise on what to order in a restaurant, list which foods are strictly off-limits and explain how to read food labels. The book continues through the postpartum period and breastfeeding, making it an excellent resource for new moms and moms-to-be. (June)

Frances Stroh’s earliest memories are ones of great privilege: shopping trips to London and New York, lunches served by black-tied waiters at the Regency Hotel, and a house filled with precious antiques, which she was forbidden to touch. Established in Detroit in 1850, by 1984 the Stroh Brewing Company had become the largest private beer fortune in America and a brand emblematic of the American dream itself; while Stroh was coming of age, the Stroh family fortune was estimated to be worth $700 million.
But behind the beautiful façade lay a crumbling foundation. Detroit’s economy collapsed with the retreat of the automotive industry to the suburbs and abroad and likewise the Stroh family found their wealth and legacy disappearing. As their fortune dissolved in little over a decade, the family was torn apart internally by divorce and one family member's drug bust; disagreements over the management of the business; and disputes over the remaining money they possessed. Even as they turned against one another, looking for a scapegoat on whom to blame the unraveling of their family, they could not anticipate that even far greater tragedy lay in store.
Featuring beautiful evocative photos throughout, Stroh’s memoir is elegantly spare in structure and mercilessly clear-eyed in its self-appraisal—at once a universally relatable family drama and a great American story.",,,,"['well written', 'frances stroh', 'grosse pointe', 'beer money', 'family business', 'rich girl', 'stroh beer', 'highly recommend', 'little rich', 'poor little', 'good read', 'stroh family', 'quick read', 'behind the scenes', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Carol has perfected the art of baking without wheat flour and learned to create delicious muffins, cakes, pies, and even yeast bread using sorghum flour, potato starch, and other safe ingredients. In 1,000 Gluten-Free Recipes, she shares her secrets and recipes for every meal. Many of the recipes are also vegetarian or quick-to-make and are highlighted with or symbols. Additionally, if you avoid dairy, Carol suggests ways to make the recipes with safe substitutes.

The good, the bad, and the ugly, served up Bourdain-style.
Bestselling chef and Parts Unknown host Anthony Bourdain has never been one to pull punches. In The Nasty Bits, he serves up a well-seasoned hellbroth of candid, often outrageous stories from his worldwide misadventures. Whether scrounging for eel in the backstreets of Hanoi, revealing what you didn't want to know about the more unglamorous aspects of making television, calling for the head of raw food activist Woody Harrelson, or confessing to lobster-killing guilt, Bourdain is as entertaining as ever.
Bringing together the best of his previously uncollected nonfiction--and including new, never-before-published material--The Nasty Bits is a rude, funny, brutal and passionate stew for fans and the uninitiated alike.",35835,"Review
“High- and low-lights from the culinary world by the delightfully jaded chef.” ―People
“His writing is at its most savory in passages about the joys of sharing food with people who love it. His words are not always gentlemanly, but they vividly convey how, say, sitting on the plastic-covered kitchen floor of an Inuit family's house and joining in as they eagerly tear into the raw liver, brain and blubber of a freshly killed seal can be, as Mr. Bourdain says, a moment of rare intimacy, pleasure and indeed beauty.” ―Wall Street Journal
“Lovable rogue chef and author of Kitchen Confidential describes stomach-roiling feasts in exotic lands and snipes at celebrity chefs in this entertaining tome.” ―Chicago Tribune
“A vivid and witty writer…[Bourdain's] greatest gift is his ability to convey his passion for professional cooking...In Bourdain's telling this is inspiring, band-of-brothers stuff, a tale of the trenches where ends almost always justify means.” ―New York Times Book Review
“[An] informed and unvarnished view from the kitchen...[Bourdain's] best writing can make food lovers quiver like raw fish.” ―Cleveland Plain Dealer

Winner of the IACP Cookbook Design Award

This ain’t no cookbook. This ain’t no memoir. This is Action Bronson’s devotional, a book about the overwhelming power of delicious—no, f*cking amazing—food. Bronson is this era’s Homer, and F*ck, That’s Delicious is a modern-day Odyssey, replete with orgiastic recipes, world travel, siren songs, and weed.
 
Illustrated, packed with images, and unlike any book in the entire galaxy, Bronson’s F*ck, That’s Delicious includes 40-plus recipes inspired by his childhood, family, tours, and travels. Journey from bagels with cheese that represent familial love to the sex and Big Macs of upstate New York fat camp and ultimately to the world’s most coveted five-star temples of gastronomy. And: the tacos in LA. The best Dominican chimis. Jamaican jerk. Hand-rolled pasta from Mario. Secrets to good eating from Massimo. Meyhem Lauren’s Chicken Patty Potpie. And more! more! more!",10553,"Review
“This book is a map of the inside of Bronson’s brain. Starting with his version of Proust’s madeleine, the ‘bagel with cheese,’ and then traveling down the THC-intensified paths of desire to include cheap street foods in the five boroughs of NYC to exotica found on his pilgrimages across the planet . . . This magnificent tome is filled with both the recognizable and the perplexing. And, best of all, I can make it at home and so can you. . . . This is a book that is at once a testament to a wild palate, to a man with a gastronomic vision, to a hip-hop artist of the top of the top category, and a student of life with legendary curiosity. Bronson is the Leonardo da Vinci of pop culture’s multi-cosmic, infinitely overstimulated, twenty-first century children of the handheld devices. At the very same moment all this is swirling around in your head, on your tongue, throughout every single muscle of your dancing, jumping being, you realize . . . F*ck!!! This is delicious.”
(Mario Batali)

“F*cking professional musician, entertainer, beloved individual, heralded human, forever chef.”
(Action Bronson)

“If chefs are ‘the new rock stars’ (the Times) and ‘rap is the new rock and roll’ (Kanye West), then the Roger Daltrey of the current moment is a cannonball-shaped thirty-one-year-old rapper from Flushing named Action Bronson.”
(The New Yorker)

“Through his career on VICELAND, Bronson has become one of the internet’s most entertaining food personalities—and his book delivers just as much loud enthusiasm for eating fucking delicious things as his show by the same name.”

Jamie Moore has always been fascinated by food and what it can do for the human body since young, so much so that he ended up putting on so much weight that the doctors' advice at one point was for him to be wheel chair bound because any physical activity was deemed too strenuous for him. Yes, even walking! Things came to a head after one particularly bad hospital episode and that triggered the process to finally shed the unwanted pounds. 
It wasn't an easy road. Despite going on varying diets, weight loss regimes and spending on the latest exercise gear, the results just weren't manifesting itself. It wasn't until Jamie chanced upon the ketogenic diet that things got turned around for the better. Enthralled with what he had found and his own positive experiences with the diet for weight loss, Jamie took up distance learning courses to get accreditation on dieting and nutrition in order to further understand more about the ketogenic diet.
That was ten years ago. These days, Jamie does forty laps in the pool with regular gym sessions thrown in for good measure. He does not term himself as a health geek, but most of his friends beg to differ! They come to him for anything on diet, nutrition and exercise. That was also part of the reason why Jamie took to penning down what he knew into books which he hopes would be of help to people.",,"['ketogenic diet', 'ketogenic diet', 'get started', 'step by step', 'meal plan', 'easy to read', 'easy to follow', 'weight loss', 'easy to understand', 'lose weight', 'need to know', 'day plan', 'definitely recommend', 'low carb', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

The legendary life and entrepreneurial vision of Fred Harvey helped shape American culture and history for three generations—from the 1880s all the way through World War II—and still influence our lives today in surprising and fascinating ways. Now award-winning journalist Stephen Fried re-creates the life of this unlikely American hero, the founding father of the nation’s service industry, whose remarkable family business civilized the West and introduced America to Americans.

Appetite for America is the incredible real-life story of Fred Harvey—told in depth for the first time ever—as well as the story of this country’s expansion into the Wild West of Bat Masterson and Billy the Kid, of the great days of the railroad, of a time when a deal could still be made with a handshake and the United States was still uniting. As a young immigrant, Fred Harvey worked his way up from dishwasher to household name: He was Ray Kroc before McDonald’s, J. Willard Marriott before Marriott Hotels, Howard Schultz before Starbucks. His eating houses and hotels along the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe railroad (including historic lodges still in use at the Grand Canyon) were patronized by princes, presidents, and countless ordinary travelers looking for the best cup of coffee in the country. Harvey’s staff of carefully screened single young women—the celebrated Harvey Girls—were the country’s first female workforce and became genuine Americana, even inspiring an MGM musical starring Judy Garland.

With the verve and passion of Fred Harvey himself, Stephen Fried tells the story of how this visionary built his business from a single lunch counter into a family empire whose marketing and innovations we still encounter in myriad ways. Inspiring, instructive, and hugely entertaining, Appetite for America is historical biography that is as richly rewarding as a slice of fresh apple pie—and every bit as satisfying.

*With two photo inserts featuring over 75 images, and an appendix with over fifty Fred Harvey recipes, most of them never-before-published.",44226,"Review
“Part business story, part social history, part family saga, Appetite for America gives us the winning of the West in a whole new mouthwatering way.”—Hampton Sides, author of Blood and Thunder

“Appetite for America is the kind of superb non-fiction you don't see anymore—marvelously reported, fluidly written and a remarkable story about a remarkable man who influenced American culture perhaps more than anyone alive past or present. Today he is a footnote, but Stephen Fried brings him alive in a true story as brilliant as it is meticulous as it is compulsively readable.”—Buzz Bissinger, author of Friday Night Lights

A revolutionary approach to making better-looking, better-tasting drinks.
In Dave Arnold’s world, the shape of an ice cube, the sugars and acids in an apple, and the bubbles in a bottle of champagne are all ingredients to be measured, tested, and tweaked.
With Liquid Intelligence, the creative force at work in Booker & Dax, New York City’s high-tech bar, brings readers behind the counter and into the lab. There, Arnold and his collaborators investigate temperature, carbonation, sugar concentration, and acidity in search of ways to enhance classic cocktails and invent new ones that revolutionize your expectations about what a drink can look and taste like.
Years of rigorous experimentation and study―botched attempts and inspired solutions―have yielded the recipes and techniques found in these pages. Featuring more than 120 recipes and nearly 450 color photographs, Liquid Intelligence begins with the simple―how ice forms and how to make crystal-clear cubes in your own freezer―and then progresses into advanced techniques like clarifying cloudy lime juice with enzymes, nitro-muddling fresh basil to prevent browning, and infusing vodka with coffee, orange, or peppercorns.
Practical tips for preparing drinks by the pitcher, making homemade sodas, and building a specialized bar in your own home are exactly what drink enthusiasts need to know. For devotees seeking the cutting edge, chapters on liquid nitrogen, chitosan/gellan washing, and the applications of a centrifuge expand the boundaries of traditional cocktail craft.
Arnold’s book is the beginning of a new method of making drinks, a problem-solving approach grounded in attentive observation and creative techniques. Readers will learn how to extract the sweet flavor of peppers without the spice, why bottling certain drinks beforehand beats shaking them at the bar, and why quinine powder and succinic acid lead to the perfect gin and tonic.
Liquid Intelligence is about satisfying your curiosity and refining your technique, from red-hot pokers to the elegance of an old-fashioned. Whether you’re in search of astounding drinks or a one-of-a-kind journey into the next generation of cocktail making, Liquid Intelligence is the ultimate standard―one that no bartender or drink enthusiast should be without.

“A manual to the most deliciously potent science kit ever.”
- Publishers Weekly

“If you want to know exactly how much ethanol is in your vermouth, how to work with liquid nitrogen and why a red-hot poker is useful behind a bar (it’s got nothing to do with unruly patrons), [Dave] Arnold is your best guide. Serious, sure. But there’s also a great spirit of play and experimentation here.”
- Rosie Schaap, New York Times Magazine

“Examines cocktails on the nanoscale… extremely fascinating.”
- Wayne Curtis, Wall Street Journal

“His observations offer insight to anyone with a cocktail shaker and a few basic ingredients… for amateurs looking to get creative with boutique spirits, Mr. Arnold’s data is a blessing.”
- Rachel Wharton, Wall Street Journal

“Dave Arnold is the smartest person I know in the world of food and drink. He’s relentless in his pursuit of understanding, of improved and new techniques, and above all, of deliciousness. Cocktail enthusiasts and professionals alike will find insights and inspiration galore in Liquid Intelligence.”
- Harold McGee, author of On Food and Cooking

“Like modern cocktails, most books about them are rejiggered rifts on the classics that came before. And then there’s Dave Arnold’s book: an entertaining treatise of more than ten years’ worth of pioneering research he’s used to create the game-changing cocktails at his bar, Booker and Dax. Required reading for all of us from now on.”
-

“Dave Arnold has always been ahead of the curve in the cocktail world, and in this book he brings the rest of us up to speed.”
-

“Probably the most important cocktail book that’s been written ever.”

From Booklist
HOMEROOM, a popular restaurant in Oakland, California, specializes in just one dish: macaroni and cheese. This isn’t your gummy, salty, run-of-the-mill school cafeteria mac and cheese. Befitting its San Francisco Bay address, HOMEROOM daily offers dozens of variations on its signature dish, some with multiple cheeses, some with meats, some with seafood, some with vegetables. Each has a foundation of béchamel sauce, which serves to bind the pasta with cheeses and other ingredients. Arevalo and Wade address the perennial conflict between partisans of crunchy-topped vs. creamy-throughout by offering both alternatives. An appropriate wine or beer recommendation for each version also appears. For closers, HOMEROOM offers a dessert version of macaroni and cheese made with fruit and nuts, basically a riff on a traditional Jewish noodle kugel. Other desserts include carrot cake, buckeyes, and a homemade version of Oreo cookies. --Mark Knoblauch

This revolutionary diet plan works with your hormones to curb your appetite, boost your metabolism, and take the pounds off for good!

Cutting-edge research shows that losing weight is not about carbs, calories, or even willpower—it’s about a hormone called leptin, and how it functions in your body. Leptin is your body’s natural weight-loss mechanism: it curbs your appetite, jump-starts your metabolism, and when working properly makes you literally fat resistant—you will lose weight effortlessly and efficiently and never gain those pounds back.

If you’re struggling to lose weight, chances are you are “leptin resistant”—your body no longer responds to leptin, making it impossible for you to slim down. The Fat Resistance Diet is the first and only eating plan designed specifically to combat leptin resistance and reprogram your body to start melting away the pounds. Using a breakthrough combination of anti-inflammatory and hormone-balancing foods, the three-phase regimen delivers:

A loss of six to ten pounds in the first two weeks.
A loss of at least two pounds a week thereafter.
Fun, flavorful meals that make sticking with the plan a breeze.
An easy maintenance program that keeps you fat resistant for life.

Craving a life that would connect her to the earth and her family roots, McMinn packed up her three kids, left her husband and her sterile suburban existence behind, and moved to rural West Virginia. Amid the rough landscape and beauty of this rural mountain country, she pursues a natural lifestyle filled with chickens, goats, sheep—and no pizza delivery.
With her new life comes an unexpected new love—""52,"" a man as beguiling and enigmatic as his nickname—a turbulent romance that reminds her that peace and fulfillment can be found in the wake of heartbreak. Coping with formidable challenges, including raising a trio of teenagers, milking stubborn cows, being snowed in with no heat, and making her own butter, McMinn realizes that she’s living a forty-something’s coming-of-age story.
As she dares to become self-reliant and embrace her independence, she reminds us that life is a bold adventure—if we’re willing to live it.

“McMinn’s daily adventures are told with zest and charisma; she can fashion a riveting tale from an event as simple as a delivery of sweet potatoes.” (New York Times Book Review)

“[McMinn] found her road to self-realization much rockier than she imagined, but ultimately very satisfying…in her heart-on-her-sleeve, nutty narrative, she had to face the necessity for her own self-sufficiency…In this enjoyable memoir, she learned by trial and error how to do everything from scratch.” (Publishers Weekly)

“With three reluctant children and a seemingly reliable lover in tow, McMinn began to build the farm of her dreams, but nothing went quite as planned….Writing with the keen attention to detail of the seasoned author she is, McMinn relates the unexpected challenges that came along.” (Booklist)

“Lively, whimsical....McMinn outlines the trials and tribulations of adjusting to new routines without her old companions to join her; this ultimately paves the way for an epiphany or two.” (Library Journal)

“A mature woman’s heartbreaking, heroic, and hilarious coming of age story. To McMinn, life is a bold adventure, but only if you live it. And, boy, does she ever!” (Susan Elizabeth Phillips, New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of The Great Escape)

“Humorous and inspirational...a page-turning pep talk for anyone who’s ever wanted to quit their day job and do something different with their life. McMinn’s tale will leave you eager to leap, and build your wings on the way down, too.” (Susan McCorkindale, Author, Confessions of a Counterfeit Farm Girl and 500 Acres and No Place to Hide, More Confessions of a Counterfeit Farm Girl)

“A story of lessons learned…….[McMinn’s] transition into her own farmhouse and expansion into real farm living provided rich fodder for the one thing she knew she could do well: write.” ()

There they experimented with new varieties of foods as they adapted, physically and mentally, to the environment. Among the new foods found in this environment were psilocybin-containing mushrooms growing near dung of ungulate herds occupying the savannas and grasslands.
Referencing the research of Roland L. Fisher, McKenna claims the enhancement of visual acuity was an effect of psilocybin at low doses and suggests this would confer adaptive advantage. He argues that the effects of slightly larger doses, including sexual arousal, and in larger doses, ecstatic hallucinations & glossolalia - gave selective evolutionary advantages to members of those tribes who partook of it. There were many changes caused by the introduction of this psychoactive to primate diets. He hypothesizes, for instance, that synesthesia (the blurring of sensory boundaries) caused by psilocybin led to the development of spoken language: the ability to form pictures in another person's mind through the use of vocal sounds.
About 12,000 years ago, further climate changes removed psilocybin-containing mushrooms from human diets. He argues that this event resulted in a new set of profound changes in our species as we reverted to the previous brutal primate social structures that had been modified and/or repressed by frequent consumption of psilocybin.",,,,"['food of the gods', 'terence mckenna', 'drug use', 'human evolution', 'must read', 'dominator culture', 'psychedelic mushrooms', 'mind altering', 'human brain', 'great book', 'open mind', 'terrence mckenna', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

There's only so much room on the kitchen bookshelf for those 600-page baking bibles on the kitchen bookshelf, but this one's worth its weight in whole wheat flour. This fun, easy-to-follow tome is broken down into 11 basic chapters (including Yeast Breads, Cakes, Pastry and Pies), and will satisfy both health conscious bakers (Spelt Pita, Sesame Barley Bread) as well as the more gluttonous (Carmel Blitz Torte, Banana Chocolate Chip Muffins, and Triple Ginger Pancakes). Methods such as kneading dough and folding pie crust are depicted with easy-to-follow black-and-white illustrations. Sidebar topics, however, are a little haphazard—ranging from Enjoying Soybeans to Organic Plastic—yet recipe headnotes are helpful and worth the ink. Each recipe ends with detailed nutrition information, broken down per serving (including caffeine, calcium and iron amounts). In the end, this is a good buy for more than just the whole-grain enthusiast. (Oct.)

For Anne Burrell, a classically trained chef and host of Food Network’s Secrets of a Restaurant Chef (where she shares impressive recipes and smart techniques that anyone can master), and Worst Cooks in America (the show that transforms hopeless home cooks), being a rock star in the kitchen means having the confidence and ability to get a great meal on the table without a sweat.  In her debut cookbook, she presents 125 rustic yet elegant recipes, all based on accessible ingredients, along with encouraging notes and handy professional tricks that will help you cook more efficiently at home.

With Anne's guidance, even the novice cook can turn out showstoppers like Whole Roasted Fish or Rack of Lamb Crusted with Black Olives, which are special enough for guests but easy enough for a weekday evening. For Piccolini (Little Nibbles), try making Truffled Deviled Eggs, Sausage and Pancetta Stuffed Mushrooms, or Baked Ricotta with Rosemary and Lemon. Delicious first courses include Pumpkin Soup with Allspice Whipped Cream and Garlic Steamed Mussels with Pimentón Aioli. And if you're craving pasta, Chef Anne's Light-as-a-Cloud Gnocchi, Sweet and Spicy Sausage Ragù, or Killer Mac and Cheese with Bacon will blow you away.

Whether she's telling you how to use garlic most effectively (""perfume the oil, remove the garlic, and ditch it—it's fulfilled its garlic destiny!"") or reaffirming the most important part of cooking (it should have the “sparkle factor!”), you will never feel alone at the stove. Anne's effervescent personality and unmatched vitality will be there every step of the way--as teacher, coach, cooking partner, and friend.

Organized from “Piccolini and Firsts” to “Pasta, Seconds, Sides,” and, of course, “Dessert” Cook Like a Rock Star is all about empowering you with the confidence to own what you do in your kitchen, to be excited by what you're making, and to experience the same kind of joy that Anne feels everyday when she cooks and eats.",244589,"Amazon.com Review

With over 500 recipes, author Bruce Weinstein has put together the most comprehensive cookbook of its kind, covering just about every conceivable flavor of ice cream, sorbet, and granita; dozens of different recipes for shakes, malts, and other cold drinks; how to make your own ice cream cones; and toppings galore.
If you ever worried that you might not get full use out of your ice-cream maker, cast your doubts aside. Ice cream recipes feature such unusual flavors as lavender, chestnut, rhubarb, and Earl Grey tea. Even Weinstein's vanilla ice cream is anything but plain, with variations like Vanilla Crunch, Vanilla Rose, and Vanilla Cracker Jack. There is also a plethora of light, refreshing recipes for sorbets and granitas, with flavors like Apple Chardonnay, Coconut, and Kiwi. Top everything off with the author's recipes forhomemade sauces. Whether it's a special event or a midnight snack, The Ultimate Ice Cream Book has what you need to make any occasion a little sweeter.",282597,"From Publishers Weekly
Weinstein is a man who takes his treats seriously. Although his instructions are sometimes too sober for the subject matter and require some commitment, the ice creams, sorbets, sweet and savory granitas, toppings and drinks are served up with flair. There are roughly 70 recipes for ice cream, each with a number of variations, and several dozen more for sorbets. On the conservative end are four recipes for plain old vanilla and three for chocolate. For the sophisticate, there are ice creams flavored with thyme, lavender and Earl Grey tea, as well as tempting varieties using less common fruits such as fig, passion fruit, mango and rhubarb. Mix-in ideas abound with such concoctions as Ginger Ice Cream with bits of candied chestnuts, Classic Mint Chip with mini chocolate chips or Cashew Ice Cream topped with Trail Mix made by adding coconut, sunflower seeds and raisins. Weinstein even offers main course ideas: How about floating a scoop of avocado in a gazpacho soup or freeing borscht into a granita? To top things off, he provides recipes for hot fudge and other toppings, as well as for black cows and sodas that will turn any kitchen into a soda fountain. July)

From Library Journal
Here are recipes for just about every ice cream imaginable, from four different versions of plain old vanilla to Avocado Ice Cream (it's really more of a chilled guacamole served as a garnish for gazpacho). Weinstein includes dozens of basic recipes for ice creams, sorbets, and granitas, with innumerable variations, along with sodas and shakes, hot fudge and other toppings, and even homemade ice cream cones.

WINNER: 2017 JAMES BEARD FOUNDATION BOOK AWARD, BEVERAGE

WINNER: 2017 SPIRITED AWARDS (TALES OF THE COCKTAIL): BEST NEW COCKTAIL & BARTENDING BOOK

""Martin and Rebecca Cate are alchemists—Reyn Spooner–wearing, volcano-bowl-igniting, Polynesian-popping, double-straining, Aku-Aku swilling alchemists. Which is to say, they are the finest kind of alchemists known to walk the earth. Buy this book. It will bring you a little bit closer to paradise.”
—Wayne Curtis, author, And a Bottle of Rum: A History of the New World in Ten Cocktails

“With Smuggler’s Cove, Martin Cate did the impossible, folding up a whole rum-soaked sailing ship so that it would fit into a not-very-large San Francisco storefront. Now he’s done it again, and taken that tiki bar--one of the very finest bars I know—and folded it up so it fits between the pages of a book. Just add rum, and watch Smuggler’s Cove—and the whole vibrant, geeky, just a little bit unhinged world of tiki it so perfectly exemplifies— unfold in your lap.”
—David Wondrich, author of Imbibe! and Punch

“Tiki is simultaneously whimsical and sincere, simple and shockingly complex, which means understanding it can be challenging. This indispensable book explains it all—and is the definitive volume on one of the cocktail world’s most fascinating and complex genres. But in the end, tiki’s essence is based on captivating stories and exotic drinks, and Martin Cate’s Smuggler’s Cove is a tour de force in both.”
—Jordan Mackay, wine and spirits writer, and coauthor of Secrets of the Sommeliers
 
“Martin Cate understands tiki like few others do. He not only knows how to ask the right questions; in this book, he also answers many questions that I didn’t know I had. The old guard of Donn, Vic, and Steve can rest easy now that they have this champion of their tradition bringing tiki into the new millennium.”

 
“Here at last are the secrets behind one of the world’s best bars. The Cates have written an engaging, knowing, and personal book that is sure to please tiki lovers, cocktail lovers, and especially tiki-cocktail lovers. Abandon angst, all ye who enter here: like Smuggler’s Cove itself, these pages take leisure time very seriously.”

 
“Martin Cate is an authority on rum, and this book will take your level of understanding of this noble yet complex spirit to a new level. Martin offers his own illuminating rum classification system, and also tackles controversial topics head-on, such as sweetening and the use of nebulous age statements. An absolute must-have for rum enthusiasts.”

 
“The twenty-first-century revival of tiki cocktails was spearheaded by a handful of passionate tiki-geeks, Martin Cate among them. With , Martin and Rebecca teach you everything you need to know to become a tiki-geek in your own right—and to see the world with their Polynesian passion.”


“Tiki culture is enmeshed with rum, and the authors offer a master class on it, covering its history and many varieties, as well as digressions on coring pineapples for cocktails and where to score cocktail umbrellas. It’s a terrifically fun and informative read, and the definitive resource on the topic.”
–

“The book walks readers through the history of tiki, as well as 100 recipes for cocktails. Not sure where to start with rum? There's a beginners' guide. There are also party tips, garnishing guides, and much more. In other words, all you need are some paper umbrellas and your summer is made.”
–  

“Happily, the modern tiki era now has its own Magna Carta …. It’s a lavishly illustrated, seriously researched, 350-page tome with more than 100 recipes, along with a well-written history and sketches of some of the lesser known tiki lights . . .”


""Martin and Rebecca Cate have managed to create an irresistible shrine to the magic of Polynesian pop culture. Beautifully designed and dripping in kitsch by way of photos by Dylan + Jeni, this is set to be the cocktail book of the summer.""


""Your new tiki bible.""


""With more than 100 recipes, both classic and modern (including homemade grenadine and coconut cream, of course), is for anyone who appreciates the beauty of tropical drinks and wants to dig in deeper. A primer on essential tiki techniques as well as a thorough, authoritative guide to rum take you further than the typical booze book.""


""Martin Cate is a scholar of tiki, and this long-anticipated cookbook is a respectful (and even academic) glimpse into that culture. . . .  isn't just a book of recipes—it's a guide on how to transplant a beloved bar into your home.""


""A lively exploration of our country's drinking history (and the current tiki scene), it's essential reading for rum lovers, offering the best categorization of the headspinning-ly diverse spirit that I've encountered.""


""It's a must-have for any Mai Tai lover, Trader Vic's devotee or Hawaiian traveler . . .  The book works equally well as a cocktail how-to, a rum guide, tiki party inspiration or must-do itinerary.""

|About the author
MARTIN CATE is a rum and exotic cocktail expert and the owner of Smuggler’s Cove in San Francisco. Smuggler’s Cove opened in 2009 and has been named one of the World’s 50 Best Bars (Drinks International, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015), 50 Best Bars on Earth (The Sunday Times, London), Top Ten Food and Beverage Concepts of the Last 25 Years (Cheers Magazine), 13 Most Influential Bars of the 21st Century (Liquor.com), and America’s Best Bars (Playboy, 2012 and Esquire, 2013). Smuggler's Cove was also awarded Best American Cocktail Bar at the 2016 Tales of the Cocktail Spirited Awards. A member of the United States Bartenders Guild (USBG), Martin conducts educational seminars and adjudicates rum and cocktail competitions across the United States, Europe, and the Caribbean. In 2015, along with partners Alex Smith and John Park, Martin opened Whitechapel in San Francisco to bring the same passion for history and craft to the world of gin. He is also the co-owner of Hale Pele in Portland and a partner in Lost Lake in Chicago and False Idol in San Diego.


In 1999, REBECCA CATE inadvertently fueled Martin’s madness by famously uttering words (which she thought were a joke) about making a spare bedroom a home tiki bar. Since then, however, she too has been swept up in the tiki fantasia, first as an enthusiast, then helping Martin open and run Smuggler’s Cove, while juggling a full-time career as a research psychologist “on the side.” Rebecca earned her PhD in personality and social psychology from The University of California at Berkeley in 2006, and has spent over a decade leading large-scale studies of behavioral health interventions as well as topics related to retirement and longevity. The opportunity to coauthor this book has allowed what had been just a weekend and vacation escape to turn into a full-time journey.

Kristie Sullivan was obese from the age of three. She'd tried everything to lose weight, even gastric bypass.  By the age of 45 she was desperate. When she discovered a ketogenic diet, her body finally started responding positively to her eating habits. Her lifetime of struggle was resolved by eliminating carbohydrates!

Kristie Sullivan's passion is reaching out to others who struggle and helping them to learn why a ketogenic diet works, and how to make this a sustainable lifestyle.  Too many physicians recognize that carbohydrate restriction can work, yet they don’t prescribe it because they fear it isn’t sustainable.  Patient compliance is perceived as a primary barrier to success, and Kristie struggles to bridge that gap by showing that it's not only practical but sustainable for the rest of your life.

After decades spent traveling throughout Thailand, Andy Ricker wanted to bring the country's famed street food stateside. In 2005 he opened Pok Pok, so named for the sound a pestle makes when it strikes a clay mortar, in an old shack in a residential neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. Ricker's traditional take on Thai food soon drew the notice of the New York Times and Gourmet magazine, establishing him as a culinary star. Now, with his first cookbook, Ricker tackles head-on the myths that keep people from making Thai food at home: that it's too spicy for the American palate or too difficult to source ingredients.
Ricker shares more than fifty of the most popular recipes from Thailand and his Pok Pok restaurants—ranging from Khao Soi Kai (Northern Thai curry noodle soup with chicken) to Som Tam Thai (Central Thai–style papaya salad) to Pok Pok’s now-classic (and obsessed-over) Fish-Sauce Wings. But Pok Pok is more than just a collection of favorite recipes: it is also a master course in Thai cooking from one of the most passionate and knowledgeable authorities on the subject. Clearly written, impeccably tested recipes teach you how to source ingredients; master fundamental Thai cooking techniques and skills; understand flavor profiles that are unique to Southeast Asian cuisine; and combine various dishes to create show-stopping, well-balanced meals for family and friends.

Filled with thoughtful, colorful essays about Ricker’s travels and experiences, Pok Pok is not only a definitive resource for home cooks, but also a celebration of the rich history, vibrant culture, and unparalleled deliciousness of Thai food.",15379,"Amazon.com Review

From Publishers Weekly
In his introduction, Ricker makes the modest proclamation that his cooking knowledge is limited when measured against Thailand’s vast cuisine. However, this limitation has had no visible effect on his success, given that his eatery, Pok Pok, was recently rated by Bon Appétit as the eighth most important American restaurant. All one really needs to know about Ricker, and this finely detailed cookbook and travelogue, comes at the start of his recipe for fish-sauce wings. Sounding like a gourmand Allen Ginsberg, he writes, “I’ve spent the better part of the last twenty years roaming around Thailand, cooking and recooking strange soups, beseeching street vendors for stir-fry tips, and trying to figure out how to reproduce obscure Thai products with American ingredients.” He spills out his acquired knowledge here across 13 chapters and nearly 100 recipes. Lessons learned along the way include the beauty of blandness as exhibited in his flavor-balanced “bland soup” with glass noodles, and waste not, want not, as showcased in recipes for stewed pork knuckles and grilled pork neck. Ricker’s prose, as aided by food writer Goode, is captivating, whether he is discussing America’s obsession with sateh, or when profiling characters he’s encountered in his travels, such as Mr. Lit, his “chicken mentor” and Sunny, his “go-to guy in Chiang Mai.”

All-new collection from a ""revered icon"" and ""culinary guru"" (New York Times).

Over the course of her baking career, Dorie Greenspan has created more than 300 cookie recipes. Yet she has never written a book about them—until now. To merit her “three purple stars of approval,” every cookie had to be so special that it begged to be made again and again. Cookies for every taste and occasion are here. There are company treats like Portofignos, with chocolate dough and port-soaked figs, and lunch-box Blueberry Buttermilk Pie Bars. They Might Be Breakfast Cookies are packed with goodies—raisins, dried apples, dried cranberries, and oats— while Almond Crackle Cookies have just three ingredients. There are dozens of choices for the Christmas cookie swaps, including Little Rascals (German jam sandwich cookies with walnuts), Italian Saucissons (chocolate log cookies studded with dried fruit), and Snowy-Topped Brownie Drops. And who but America’s favorite baker could devise a cookie as intriguing as Pink-Peppercorn Thumbprints or as popular as the World Peace Cookie, with its 59 million Internet fans?

A Tasting Table Fall 2016 Pick
An Epicurious Fall 2016 Pick

""Greenspan, the IACP and James Beard award–winning chef and New York Times bestselling cookbook author, admits in the introduction to her latest book that she has wanted to create an all-cookie cookbook since she wrote her first book in 1991. It may have taken Greenspan a while to finally give fans the gift of an all-cookie cookbook, but it was worth the wait, as it encompasses all of her influences over the years: the techniques and flavors learned at Julia Child’s side, years working with Parisian patissier Pierre Herme, and recipes from the pop-up shop she and her son ran. Fans of Greenspan’s other cookbooks will be pleased by the variety of recipes, including old favorites such as the World Peace Cookie. There are elaborate sandwich cookies, humble drop cookies, and revisions of chocolate chip cookies. A chapter devoted to savory cookies offers, among other unexpected treats, honey–blue cheese madeleines and spicy togarashi meringues. Unexpected and magnificent-sounding creations such as a Thanksgiving bar, made with homemade cranberry jam and fresh raspberries sandwiched between a crust made from cocoa-walnut shortbread remind readers that Greenspan is, let’s say it, the cookie savant of our time. Recipes in the book, as always the case with Greenspan’s recipes, are thorough enough to allow an unsure baker to find success. Accomplished bakers will be challenged and inspired by the breadth of recipes and the many suggestions Greenspan offers throughout the book to modify recipes. This is a cookbook to read, bake, and eat your way through.""

Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun,Ina Garten,4.7,228,,23.27,18.99,"After more than twenty years of running Barefoot Contessa, the acclaimed specialty food store, Ina Garten published her first collection of recipes. The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook was an overnight sensation, but it's the kind of success that can only be grounded in years of experience. In it, Ina shared her ideas for familiar food but with outstanding flavor and -- most important of all -- recipes that really work.

Now, with Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ina shares secrets she has gleaned from her years not only as a caterer but as a dedicated party giver. The keyword here is fun. Ina's parties are easy to prepare and fun for everyone, including the host. Forget those boring Saturday-night dinners that just won't end. With Ina's advice, you're certain to have all your friends saying, ""Wasn't that fun!""

Ina has packed Barefoot Contessa Parties! with plans for pulling off parties like a pro, stories about her own parties, and tips on assembling food (rather than cooking everything) and organizing like a caterer. In the spring you can invite your friends to a party where they all make their own pizzas. Come summer, it's into the garden for a lunch with grilled lamb and pita sandwiches that guests assemble themselves. In the autumn, when it's not Thanksgiving, Ina roasts a fresh turkey, which her friends enjoy with popovers and a creamy spinach gratin. And on a snowy winter's day, everyone is invited for a lunch buffet with seafood chowder and butternut squash and apple soup.

Ever since Ina published her first book, people write, e-mail, and stop her on the street to say how much they love the food. She's reached new heights here with recipes like sour cream coffee cake--the ultimate breakfast treat. Salads? The red lettuce, balsamic onions, and blue cheese; Chinese chicken salad; and panzanella may be the best you've ever tasted. Filet of beef is easy to make for a fancy dinner with oh-so-good gorgonzola sauce, or sliced into sandwiches and served with lobster rolls for a Superbowl party. And fans of The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook will be delighted to find the recipe for the Lemon Cake they drooled over but only saw pictured, right here in this book.

With so many great ideas and recipes in these pages for you to use, your friends will start to wonder why your parties are always so much fun.",25383,"Amazon.com Review
""A good party is not about the food,"" says Ina Garten, ""it's about the people."" That may be true, but her Barefoot Contessa Parties! will ensure that your next party is a fabulous one, regardless of your guest list. Garten, author of The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook and a monthly column in Martha Stewart Living, has been catering since 1978. So who better to put together a collection of entertaining theme parties? She's included everything from drinks and hors d'oeuvres to dessert and coffee, as well as notes about what ""surprises,"" atmospheres, venues, and table decorations lend themselves to each. Because she likes to attend her own parties (and who doesn't?), almost every recipe is make-ahead and remarkably uncomplicated.
From casual get-togethers, such as the Pizza Party--which includes recipes for Caesar Salad with Pancetta, California Pizzas that your guests can assemble themselves, and Ice-Cream Sodas--to the elegant Academy Awards dinner--where your guests will enjoy Raspberry Vodka, Rori's Potato Chips with Caviar Dip, Smoked Salmon with Mesclun, Filet of Beef with Gorgonzola Sauce, Roasted Cherry Tomatoes, Garlic Roasted Potatoes, and Chocolate Ganache Cake--Garten's parties are well thought out and well organized. Divided by season, you'll look forward to Summer's Outdoor Grill, which starts with Real Margaritas, followed by Endive and Avocado Salad, Grilled Herb Shrimp with Mango Salsa, Spaghettoni al Pesto, Tomato Fennel Salad, and Peach Raspberry Shortcakes for dessert. Autumn brings beautiful menus like the one where you cook with your guests and end up with a feast of Potato Pancakes with Caviar, Salad with Warm Goat Cheese, Rack of Lamb, Orzo with Roasted Vegetables, and Apple Crostata. Winter's menus bring soul-warming food, such as Seafood Chowder, Butternut Squash and Apple Soup, and a recipe for possibly the world's best Chocolate Chunk Cookies. Spring offers menus such as the Sunday Breakfast, with a main course of Roasted Asparagus with Scrambled Eggs, and the Jewish Holiday Party, with Chicken Soup with Matzo Balls.
Filled with funny party anecdotes, a bit of Ina Garten history, and clever hints and tips to help guarantee the success of these recipes, this collection, subtitled ""Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun,"" delivers on every count. --Leora Y. Bloom

Building on the success of The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook, Garten presents 16 simple menus, yielding readers four fun and distinctive parties per season. True to her theory that the easiest parties are usually the best, Garten offers sound advice (e.g., prepare dishes in advance when possible so you can be a guest at your own party, and use strategy when building a guest list) and fare within the reach of any cook. Moreover, by suggesting many dishes that can be served at room temperature, she helps hosts minimize any last-minute frenzies. Brisket with Carrots and Onions requires very little supervision, and Chocolate Ganache Cake can be baked a week ahead and glazed the day it's served. Garten pumps up the flavor with such recipes as Potato Pancakes with Caviar and an irresistible vinaigrette-tossed salad topped by sliced onions baked with balsamic vinegar and then by crumbled Maytag blue cheese. Potables are as innocent as Tropical Smoothies and as potent as Raspberry Vodka and Real Margaritas. (Apr.)Forecast: Having already catapulted herself from her eponymous gourmet shop in East Hampton, N.Y., to the national stage, Garten is sure to secure the success of her second book with the added exposure of her own cooking show on the Food Network, regular appearances on Martha Stewart Living and her high-profile Web site (www.barefootcontessa.com).

The Paris Tasting of 1976 will forever be remembered as the landmark event that transformed the wine industry. At this legendary contest—a blind tasting—a panel of top French wine experts shocked the industry by choosing unknown California wines over France’s best.

George M. Taber, the only reporter present, recounts this seminal contest and its far-reaching effects, focusing on three gifted unknowns behind the winning wines: a college lecturer, a real estate lawyer, and a Yugoslavian immigrant. With unique access to the main players and a contagious passion for his subject, Taber renders this historic event and its tremendous aftershocks—repositioning the industry and sparking a golden age for viticulture across the globe.

There are many cookbooks loaded with recipes which do not build any foundation for the serious hobbyist to follow. This leaves him with little understanding of the sausage making process and afraid to introduce his own ideas. There are professional books that are written for meat plant managers or graduate students, unfortunately, these works are written in such difficult technical terms, that most of them are beyond the comprehension of an average person. Home Production of Quality Meats and Sausages bridges the gap that exists between highly technical textbooks and the requirements of the typical hobbyist. In order to simplify this gap to the absolute minimum, technical terms were substituted with their equivalent but simpler terms and many photographs, drawings and tables were included. The book covers topics such as curing and making brines, smoking meats and sausages, U.S. Standards, making fresh, smoked, emulsified, fermented and air dried products, making special sausages such as head cheeses, blood and liver sausages, low salt, low fat and Kosher products, hams, bacon, butts and loins, poultry, fish and game, creating your own recipes and much more...To get the reader started 172 recipes are provided which were chosen for their originality and historical value. They carry an enormous value as a study material and as a valuable resource on making meat products and sausages. Although recipes play an important role in these products, it is the process that ultimately decides the sausage quality. It is perfectly clear that the authors don't want the reader to copy the recipes only: ""We want him to understand the sausage making process and we want him to create his own recipes. We want him to be the sausage maker.""",38503,"Review
One doesn't need a huge meat factory to make excellent meat. ""Home Production of Quality Meats and Sausages"" is a guide for the do-it-yourself individual who wants to make their own sausages and other quality meats to put their own spin on these classics. From making good cures to smoking meat and living up the USDA standards, ""Home Production of Quality Meats and Sausages"" is a top pick for anyone who likes making their own food.
- Midwest Book Review


Here is the 'whole earth catalog' of sausage making and meat curing, appropriate for beginners and experts alike. It's all here -- all the info about the equipment, the methods, the meat, the recipes -- absolutely everything you'll need to become an quality meat processor. This well-organized and well-written book will help you turn your beef, pork, wild game, fish or fowl into great tasting products. The Marianskis definitely know what they're doing, and sharing their expertise with this book is a gift to us all.
- Jim Barnes, Editor Independent Publisher Online


Home Production is not for the faint of heart (or vegetarian). At nearly 700 pages, it's a meaty tome. The vast amount of information, though wonderfully laid out and clearly explained, may scare off someone who is looking for something more lightweight. Home Production will probably interest the more serious amateur, a reader looking for ""just a recipe"" should probably go elsewhere.
  One of the most clearly written and serious cooking science books available to home cooks, Home Production of Quality Meats and Sausages is the ideal reference for the reader interested in self-sufficiency. Armed with the information in Home Production and the willingness to experiment, nearly anyone could become a confident sausage-maker.

For those living at high altitude, baking can be a challenge at best, or a total disaster.

Until now. Award-winning cookbook author Susan G. Purdy has finally written the first-ever foolproof guide to high-altitude baking.
Purdy has actually ""gone there and done that,"" staying as long as it took to bake these recipes to perfection at five different locations -- and elevations -- across thecountry. In Pie in the Sky, Purdy leaves behind old conversion tables, disproves many oft-repeated calculations and adjustments, and presents reliable recipes in their entirety for each altitude. She takes out the tinkering and guarantees success at any height.
In addition, she explains the hows and whys, gives tips and hints for problems specific to every altitude, and generally demystifies the subject of atmospheric obstacles that cause favorite recipes to flop. Whether they live in the eastern mountains or the far west, in Boston, Massachusetts; Boone, North Carolina; or Santa Fe, New Mexico; home bakers as well as experienced chefs will love the wide range of easy-to-make treats including Mile-High Lemon Meringue Pie, Coconut Cake with Coconut Icing, Paradise Peak Chocolate Soufflé, Vail Lemon-Poppy Seed Loaf, Celestial Challah, and Sour Cream Streusel Coffee Cake.
Every recipe was tested at sea level (Connecticut), 3,000 feet (North Carolina and Virginia), 5,000 feet (Idaho and Colorado), 7,000 feet (New Mexico), and 10,000 feet (Colorado) and can be used at these elevations or any points in between.",45785,,"About the Author

Naturally, this grilling cookbook spends more time than most explaining which kind of grill readers should use in order for food to come out perfectly. And although the book is co-published by the biggest name in grilling, it plays fair when recommending products. An introductory chapter, for example, doesn't name names when explaining how to choose a gas grill or charcoal grill. And lessons on building a fire with coals and lighting a gas grill will be of use to any cook, regardless of the brand of his or her grill. After covering the basics, Purviance, a food writer with a degree from the Culinary Institute of America, shares some bang-up recipes for grilled red meat, pork, poultry, fish, vegetables, side dishes and even desserts. He keeps things simple, but revels in perfecting each dish. So instructions for making a hamburger-whether it's a Cheeseburger of Champions, a Bacon and Swiss Burger, or a Double-Decker Mushroom Beef Burger-describe which kind of meat to buy, how big each patty should be and what to do in order to get ""beautifully grilled burgers."" This upmarket yet non-threatening grilling text is sure to please anyone new to grilling as well as old hands who want to brush up their skills.

Mollie left school at age fourteen and became a scullery maid for a wealthy gentleman with a mansion house in London’s Knighsbridge and a Tudor manor in Norfolk.
            Even though Mollie's days were long and grueling and included endless tasks, such as polishing doorknobs, scrubbing steps, and helping with all of the food prep in the kitchen, she enjoyed her freedom and had a rich life. Like any bright-eyed teenager, Mollie also spent her days daydreaming about boys, dresses, and dances. She became fast friends with the kitchen maid Flo, dated a sweet farmhand, and became secretly involved with a brooding, temperamental footman.

A former kitchen maid conducts a guided tour of a bygone era in this entertaining recounting of life below stairs. After leaving school at age 14, Mollie Browne took a position as a scullery maid for a toff with both a townhouse in London and a manor in Norfolk. Much more than a dull recitation of duties and directives, this chatty memoir provides a glimpse into a vanishing lifestyle as well as a window into the dreams and desires of a spirited young woman eager for adventure and romance. With the wildly popular Downton Abbey series rapidly marching through the decades, this eyewitness portrait of domestic life between the two world wars provides some fascinating yet realistic background for both fans and social historians. --Margaret Flanagan

The Fast Diet Cookbook

Some of the recipes are gloriously simple, others are more complex; some are favorites adapted for the FastDiet, while others introduce new flavor combinations. Some will get you walking or gardening. Others will send you to the cupboard for a bunch of cans.

• The book includes both simple recipes and leisurely recipes, allowing you to spend as much or as little time as you please preparing your fast day food.

• Each recipe has a clear calorie count per portion, with calorie contents increasing as you go through each chapter. The idea is that you can choose a breakfast and a supper, in whatever combination you wish, to arrive at your 500- or 600-calorie budget for the day. For good pairings, refer to the examples in the Meal Plans.

• Some recipes serve two or more—simply because the cooking method works better that way (it’s difficult to make a sauce work for one)—but the calorie count is always for a single portion.

• Feel free to bump up the leafy vegetables in most of the recipes; it won’t make much difference to overall calorie intake, but will add bulk and welcome nutrients.

• Each recipe clearly shows its Nutritional Bonus (look for NB), together with the GI or GL score where useful.

We all know that adding a generous slab of butter to almost anything will make it taste fantastic. Our job here is to fill the flavor vacuum with something other than saturated fat. In this race, the humble lemon is in pole position: Lemon juice is a remarkable flavor enhancer, capable of lending goodness to countless slow-cooked savory dishes. Roasted garlic is similarly delicious. You’ll discover that plenty of the recipes in this book depend on the “fantastic five”—lime juice, soy sauce, fresh ginger, garlic, and Asian fish sauce—which deliver mighty bursts of flavor with the merest suggestion of calories. Herbs and spices also feature heavily in fast day cooking. Cumin seeds, cardamom pods, sweet Spanish paprika, dense green basil, delicate tendrils of dill . . . they are not garnishes here, but central to the proceedings. Chiles, too, are worth their weight in gold. Do remember to wear gloves when you slice or chop them—your eyes will thank you later.

Here, then, are the basic ingredients for a fast day cupboard.

For an alternative to pasta or wheat noodles, try shirataki noodles. Made from a water-soluble, plant-based fiber called glucomannan, they have no fat, sugar, gluten, or starch. No flavor either, so call upon the fantastic five. If you need a bread substitute, have a thin rye crispbread. But as a rule, avoid white carbs on a fast day.

Though carbs are necessarily limited on a fast day, those you do eat should be whole grains, not refined ones—they have more fiber, B vitamins, and other nutrients, and take longer to digest. Quinoa is a great source of protein, as is bulgur, while the best fast day rice is brown basmati. Old-fashioned oatmeal outranks the rest: less processed, more bulky.

Legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, split peas, and a whole world of beans are excellent sources of plant protein and fiber, and rank low on the GI scale. Toss cans of pintos, borlotti, or butter beans (experiment—you can’t really go wrong) into your shopping cart—you’ll find plenty of recipes here to turn a can into a dinner.

You won’t get far around here without a can of diced tomatoes, so always have one or two on hand (plus a tube of tomato paste to add bass-note depth to all manner of savory dishes). I particularly like fire-roasted tomatoes, which are especially tasty. A couple of cans of tuna (in spring water to minimize calories) and a jar or can of anchovy fillets? Vital.

Choose “smart fats” over saturated fats, which means butter must take a backseat. Instead, use

Olive oil A monounsaturated oil that is more resistant to the damaging effects of heat than polyunsaturated oils such as corn oil. A recent study from the University of Munich found that olive oil keeps you feeling fuller longer. You need expensive extra virgin olive oil only for salad dressings and drizzling; use standard olive oil for cooking.

Unrefined flaxseed oil Flaxseeds are rich in alpha linolenic acid (an omega-3 fat) and are a condensed source of antiviral, antioxidant lignans. Use cold-pressed flaxseed oil for salad dressings (don’t cook with it or you’ll annihilate the goodness).

Coconut oil Slower to oxidize and less damaged by heat than other cooking oils; a good source of heart-healthy fatty acids, and it shouldn’t your raise cholesterol.

Canola oil Only 7 percent saturated fat (butter is 51 percent), and unlike olive oil, it doesn’t degrade at high heat, so this is one for the wok.

Steer clear of heavy dairy on a fast day. Some recipes in this book call for crème fraîche or unflavored low-fat yogurt. It’s worth noting that certain cheeses are lower in calories than others: Feta, for example, is made from sheep’s milk and is a good source of protein, calcium, and vitamin B12. Low-fat mozzarella is a handy staple in the fridge.

Sunflower and pumpkin seeds are nutritious additions to morning muesli and salad suppers, bringing good plant fats to your diet.

Nuts are satiating, full of fiber, and handy to have around when hunger calls. Though they are generally calorific, it’s worth keeping packets of pine nuts, almonds, pistachios, and walnuts (rich in omega-9s) to add to salads and oatmeal.

Your own tastes will dictate exactly what you keep on this shelf (in the cupboard and in the fridge).

Bouillon cubes and powders, including Vegeta

As many spices as you can usefully own without anyone complaining

Red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, and smoked paprika

Tabasco and Worcestershire sauces

Garlic, lots of it, preferably fresh, but also pureed or chopped (in a jar) to keep in the fridge

Fresh ginger to slice into pretty much anything, from stir-fries to tea

Mustard of any and all varieties; they do different jobs: spiky yellow English; ochre, rounded Dijon; grainy Dijon for mellow bite and texture

Onions, shallots, green onions or scallions—the last gives you onion flavor with minimum fuss

Asian fish sauce, soy sauce (choose a low-sodium version), and mirin

White wine vinegar, red wine vinegar, cider vinegar, and rice vinegar: like mustard, vinegars have subtly different roles to play

Canned diced green chiles, for days when you can’t be bothered to chop

Avoid refined sugar on a fast day. Honey, though natural, will spike your blood sugar. Rather than using lab-developed sugar substitutes, try adding a sprinkling of coconut to breakfast porridge, or use a touch of raw agave nectar: known in Mexico as aguamiel, or “honey water,” agave is a low-GI sweetener produced from a cactus-like plant.

I would always use glittering coarse sea salt or flaky salt, and peppercorns to grind fresh in a grinder, all of which have a glorious fragrance and texture.

1. Lemons

2. Free-range eggs

3. Reduced-fat hummus

4. Nonstarchy vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, peppers, radishes, cherry tomatoes, celery, cucumber, mushrooms, lettuce, sugar snaps, snow peas, and a bag of young spinach)

5. Feta, cottage cheese, and low-fat mozzarella

6. Sprouts (alfalfa, mung, soy, and all their friends)

7. Pickled guindillas, jalapeños, and cornichons (or small dill pickles)

8. Fresh strawberries

9. Fresh chiles

10. Unflavored low-fat yogurt

1. Ginger; easier to grate from the frozen root

2. Sofritto, aka mirepoix (finely diced onion, carrot, and celery in a 2:1:1 ratio), to save time and energy when cooking any number of recipes

3. Homemade vegetable, chicken, and fish stock, frozen in ice cube trays and transferred to heavy-duty plastic bags, and in 1- and 2-cup plastic containers

4. Fresh herbs, frozen with a little water in ice cube trays

5. Soups: double the recipe and freeze for another day. Thick soups freeze best; you may want to loosen with more stock once thawed.

6. Frozen peas, edamame, and fava beans. Toss them into soups, stews, and (after blanching) salads

7. Frozen blueberries, for a cool little snack (strawberries do not freeze well without added sugar)

The recipes here require little expertise and even less equipment. You may, however, find it handy to have the following stashed somewhere in the kitchen.

• Stick blender or canister blender for pureeing

• Food processor

• Multilevel steamer (bamboo or stainless steel), a saucepan with a steamer insert, or a steamer basket

• A mandoline or julienne peeler for shredding vegetables

• Mortar and pestle or mini food processor for grinding spices

• A cast-iron grill pan, to allow fat to run off meat

• Nonstick cookware, including a nonstick wok and nonstick foil (such as Release) to reduce the need for oil

• Silicone brush for oiling

• Parchment paper for lining pans and for steaming foods “en papillote”

• A zester and/or a grater, such as a Microplane

• A kitchen scale; many of the recipes here call for you to weigh ingredients. Don’t worry; it’s easy and you’ll soon get the hang of it.

• Whichever cooking oil you choose (), a spray will reduce your use. Some brands of olive oil spray, for example, have less than 1 calorie per spray.

• Alternatively, use a silicone brush to apply oil to the pan and dab away excess with a paper towel.

• To stop ingredients from sticking, add a little water to the pan rather than a slug of oil.

• Boiling or poaching means you are not adding any fast day calories.

• A perfectly poached egg has a lovely rounded shape, a soft yet firm white, and a deliciously runny yolk. A good trick to achieve poached perfection is to place the whole (very fresh) egg, in its shell, in boiling water for 15 seconds prior to breaking and poaching as normal.

• Time is, of course, of the essence when it comes to poaching eggs—though you can poach them up to a day in advance. Simply slip the cooked eggs into a bowl of cold water, cover, and refrigerate. To reheat, drain, cover with boiling water, and leave for 2 to 3 minutes, draining well on paper towels.

• Cooking poultry with its skin on will maximize flavor and prevent drying out, but don’t eat the skin. Much of the fat lies there.

• Roast on a rack over a baking pan to allow excess fat to drip away.

• Similarly, a cast-iron grill pan channels fat into the grooves and away from your plate—as a bonus, you also get a tasty grill-mark effect.

• Whenever possible, cook meat and fish on a barbecue—it’s your fat-free summer standby.

• Replace ground beef with mushrooms, textured vegetable protein (TVP), or Quorn to lessen your calorie cost.

• If you do eat beef or lamb, choose grass-fed or pasture-raised meat. It has less fat and more omega-3s than grain-fed meat (and grass or pasture feeding also implies that the animal was humanely raised).

• Extend your meat choices to include lean game. Venison, for example, has a fraction of the fat found in beef.

• Scrub vegetables rather than peel them, as many nutrients are found close to the skin. Eating the skins will add fiber .

• Steam vegetables instead of boiling them, or use the microwave; that way their nutrients are more likely to remain intact.

• If you do boil vegetables, use as little water as possible and do not overcook them. Overcooking degrades their flavor and nutritional benefit.

• When browning and caramelizing vegetables, put them in a hot dry pan, then spray with oil, rather than putting the oil in the pan first. This will reduce the amount of oil absorbed during cooking.

• To skin tomatoes, cut an X in the bottom, dunk in boiling water for 30 seconds, cool briefly in ice water, and peel with a sharp knife or a thumbnail.

• To peel garlic, bash the clove with the heel of your hand or immerse first in warm water for 30 seconds.

• To skin roasted peppers, place the blackened peppers in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap for 10 minutes, then peel.

• Don’t salt lentils during cooking; it will toughen them. Season when ready to serve.

• As a rule, use fresh herbs rather than dried, as they tend to have more flavor and nutrients. Grow them on a windowsill, or keep cut herbs in jars of water in the fridge like bouquets. Alternatively, wrap fresh herbs in just-damp paper towels and keep them in the crisper.

• A good stock is the foundation of countless savory dishes. You can buy ready-made stock in boxes and cans, but making your own is good for the belly and, it has to be said, good for the soul.

• Have stock handy in the freezer; simply heat it up and add frozen vegetables or herbs, warm through, and you’ve got yourself a bowl of fast day flavor.

• Roasting bones before adding them to the stockpot will boost color and flavor; a roasted chicken carcass is ideal.

• Don’t chuck lone bones: freeze them and make a stock when you have a decent pile.

• Add a bouquet of herbs for more flavor; make your own by tying a bunch of garden herbs with string, making them easy to fish out when they’ve done their work.

• Adding a teaspoon of vinegar to a stock will aid the extraction of minerals without unduly influencing the flavor.

• Simmer slowly—a good stock should not be rushed—and top up with water to ensure the pot doesn’t boil dry.

• Skim off any fat and froth that rise to the top of the pot. Place paper towels on the surface to absorb fat, or chill first to make skimming easier. If keeping stock for later use, retain the layer of fat on top to protect it in the fridge. Simply skim when you’re ready to use.

• Thicken soup with legumes instead of potatoes. A handful of lentils will do the trick.

• Gravitate toward clear vegetable broths. Miso soup and pho are lower in calories than dense chowders, bisques, and cream soups.

• Vegetable stock generally has a lower fat content than chicken stock.

• If it suits the recipe, leave vegetables whole or in large chunks, rather than pureeing them.

• Make soup in generous batches and freeze; smooth, thick soups perform best. And remember that soups, like stews, often taste better the next day.

• Add miso or bouillon cubes or powder to intensify taste.

• When making a soup base, don’t sweat vegetables in butter; use water or a spray of oil.

• If you’re not adding fat, you do need to add flavor. Red pepper flakes, cumin, star anise, cloves, a squeeze of lemon, handfuls of herbs—these will all make your soup bowl sing.

• A pinch of sugar will bring out the flavor in tomato-based soups.

• Use a piece of Parmesan rind to impart a dense, savory richness to your soup stock at negligible calorie cost.

If all this cooking sounds like too much of a commitment on a day when you really don’t want to think about food, there are options so simple that you barely need to be conscious to get them into your mouth. These include

• Raw vegetables—baby carrots in a bag will do—plus a mini container of hummus

• Low-GI fruit such as strawberries, cherries, apples, and pears (eat the core)

• Unsweetened muesli with skimmed milk

• Weight Watchers Baked Beans

• A cup of bouillon or clear broth

• A hard-boiled egg

• A grab of salad leaves from a bag; thawed shrimp from the freezer; a good squeeze of lemon; salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes

• A pile of lightly steamed vegetables—anything you may find in the fridge—with lots of black pepper and a good grating of Parmesan or pecorino

• A few slices of fat-free ham with a ripe, sliced beefsteak tomato

• Soup from a shop, preferably a light vegetable soup, not a thick cream soup or pasta soup

• Microwavable low-calorie meals. They’re an expensive way to get a fast day fix, but the labels are clear and the nutrition should be balanced.

• Other store-bought quickies: if you are nipping out of the office on a fast day, there are good options available, as long as you choose wisely and check the calorie counts.

But, of course, it’s so much better to make your own fast day food . . .

""As a baking and cake design instructor, I'm a firm believer in meeting students where they are in the learning process, without judgement.

I've made a lot of cakes ""from scratch"", but the recipes I keep going back to again and again are Mandy's doctored cake mix recipes. They're a time saver and honestly the best cakes I've ever made, both for flavor and texture. If people are giving this book poor reviews because it has doctored cake mixes in it, they probably haven't actually tried Mandy's recipes. She has meticulously added the correct proportions of additional wet ingredients, dry ingredients, and extra flavors to make each cake so moist and delicious. These recipes DO NOT taste like you baked a cake mix from reading the instructions on the back of the box. They're on an entirely different level. Her buttercream recipes are also incredible - I thought I hated frostings until I tried making Mandy's. On top of it all, the photography is stunning. I intend on trying every recipe in this book. Way to go, Mandy! -Olivia Lighten 

I would have paid double. I absolutely love this recipe book. When it came, I spent hours pouring over the amazing pictures, tips, and flavor combos. I dream about the recipes (literally) and every one I have tried has been amazing. The recipes are inventive, easy, and better tasting than anything you'll find anywhere. I've taken Wilton cake decorating classes, classes from professionals, and I've been decorating cakes for ten years. Only now do I feel like my cakes are truly impressive. NOTHING gets results like the tips, step by step examples, and award-worthy recipes from this book. The only regret you'll have is for the cakes you made prior to her methods (don't ignore the howto for decorating in this book - your cakes will be at a whole new level, magazine-worthy and more delicious than any ""from scratch"" recipe I have ever tried (I have tried hundreds). -Kurt Mueller

From the Author
At the center of almost every celebration and many other types of gatherings in life is something we've all come to know and love - those sweet soft layers of cake smothered in mouthwatering buttercream.

We start off our first birthday with family members smiling around us, singing, and fawning over our squishy little baby cheeks, which are covered in buttercream from our first clumsy bite of cake. We continue this celebration every year as we grow older with yet another birthday cake and wishes as we blow out the candles.

The oven flips on for a cake we will bake for loved ones who may be in need of some cheering up after sleepless nights with a newborn, a recent loss, a difficult trial, or perhaps simply for a family dinner gathering. Cake may be on the dessert table to celebrate a well-worked-for graduation, a hard-earned retirement, or finally scoring that job promotion.

Hundreds of family members and close friends gather together to celebrate the true love of a couple as they slice their wedding cake together. All eyes are on them (and the cake) as they begin their new life together. And cake will often be part of subsequent milestones in their relationship--ten, twenty-five, and fifty year anniversaries. Cake is a huge part of all our lives, and I believe there's no better way to celebrate than with a can't-put-your-fork-down delicious cake on the table to share with those you love most.

This cookbook, or what I often refer to as a ""cakebook,"" has everything you'll need to build enough cake confidence to jump into your kitchen and bake, stack, and decorate a cake that not only looks delicious, but tastes so good that everyone will think you spent hours in the kitchen perfecting the recipe. I've done the work for you, so it's time to pull out your mixer and cake pans and bake to your heart's content. I can't wait for you to follow my cake-decorating tutorial, and try these treasured recipes of mine, because after all,

You read Skinny Bitch and it totally rocked your world. Now you want to know, “What can I cook that's good for me, but doesn't taste like crap?” Well, lucky for you, the Bitches are on the case. Self-proclaimed pigs, Rory and Kim understand all too well: Life without lasagna isn't a life worth living; chocolate cake is vital to our survival; and no one can live without mac ‘n cheese-no one. So can you keep to your SB standards and eat like a whale? Shit yeah, bitches. To prove it, Rory and Kim came up with some kick-ass recipes for every craving there is: Bitchin' Breakfasts PMS (Pissy Mood Snacks) Sassy Soups and Stews Grown-up Appetizers Comfort Cookin' Hearty Ass Sandwiches Happy Endings (Desserts) And a ton more! They are all so good (and easy to make) you're gonna freak out. Seriously. What are you waiting for? Get your skinny ass in the kitchen!",314614,"From Publishers Weekly
The follow-up to bestselling diet guide Skinny Bitch, this irreverent cookbook orders readers to toss out all their meat, eggs and dairy, and make room for nutritional yeast, seitan and something called ""Bragg's Liquid Aminos"" (although soy sauce will do in a pinch). The authors' philosophy is simple but rigid: in order to be skinny, one must also be vegan (and, preferably, willing to give up coffee and white sugar). Not to despair-the svelte can eat all the tofu-based fake meat and cheese they want, and follow it up with dessert-alikes such as Bitchtastic Brownies or Cheezecake. For the most part, recipes are easy and inoffensive; while a ""Chicken"" Parmesan Panini will fool nobody, other offerings, like Japanese Soba Noodles with Steamed Vegetables and Tofu, are perfectly satisfying. But to enjoy this cookbook in full, a reader must be content to be addressed (repeatedly) as ""bitch,"" as in, ""Who's a boring old fart now, bitch?"" Confusingly, there's no nutritional information for any of the recipes, nor is there any information on the specific dietary needs of vegans-apparently, you'll need to buy Freedman and Barnouin's first book for that. (For those who haven't tried, switching to a vegan diet is difficult even with a proper guide; this book's complete lack of support should make it a real bitch.)

Review
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine(PCRM) pcrm.org 1/13/10
A new PCRM report finds that many cookbooks released or revived in the last decade encourage readers to consume more fattening meat-heavy meals at a time when record obesity rates mean that Americans have never needed more encouragement to eat nutritious low-fat foods. “These high-fat recipes help explain why America’s obesity-related medical spending doubled over the past decade,” said PCRM nutrition director Susan Levin, M.S., R.D. “You’d need a magnifying glass to find a vegetable in some of these cookbooks. But the good news is that a growing number of chefs are offering tasty meatless recipes that can help us stay trim and healthy.” The decade’s best cookbooks… The Kind Diet by Alicia Silverstone, Skinny Bitch in the Kitch: Kick-Ass Recipes for Hungry Girls Who Want to Stop Cooking Crap (and Start Looking Hot!) by Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin, The Conscious Cook by Tal Ronnen, The Engine 2 Diet by Rip Esselstyn, Cooking the Whole Foods Way by Christina Pirello.

A cookbook dedicated to raw food appears oxymoronic to the uninitiated, but people who aim to pursue a raw vegan diet soon realize that eating uncooked foods involves more than simply chomping into whatever sits on grocers' produce shelves. Phyo shows how to create more complex flavor harmonies. Nutmeats of all sorts serve as a basis of many recipes, offering a spectrum of uses from cheese substitutions to pie crusts. Dates stand in for the sweetness less healthfully derived from refined sugar. Raw zucchini strips mimic fettuccini. A close reading of the nutritional analysis for each recipe reveals the high levels of dietary fiber this diet introduces. Although most of Phyo's ingredients are readily available, she does occasionally call for unfamiliar items such as liquid aminos, a replacement for soy sauce. Phyo also provides recipes for raw vegan dog food. Illustrations consist mainly of photographs of the author. Knoblauch, Mark

For over three decades, Deborah Madison has been at the vanguard of the vegetarian cooking movement, authoring classic books on the subject and emboldening millions of readers to cook simple, elegant, plant-based food.

This groundbreaking new cookbook is Madison’s crowning achievement: a celebration of the diversity of the plant kingdom, and an exploration of the fascinating relationships between vegetables, edible flowers, herbs, and familiar wild plants within the same botanical families.

Destined to become the new standard reference for cooking vegetables, Vegetable Literacy shows cooks that, because of their shared characteristics, vegetables within the same family can be used interchangeably in cooking. It presents an entirely new way of looking at vegetables, drawing on Madison’s deep knowledge of cooking, gardening, and botany. For example, knowing that dill, chervil, cumin, parsley, coriander, anise, lovage, and caraway come from the umbellifer family makes it clear why they’re such good matches for carrots, also a member of that family. With more than 300 classic and exquisitely simple recipes, Madison brings this wealth of information together in dishes that highlight a world of complementary flavors. Griddled Artichokes with Tarragon Mayonnaise, Tomato Soup and Cilantro with Black Quinoa, Tuscan Kale Salad with Slivered Brussels Sprouts and Sesame Dressing, Kohlrabi Slaw with Frizzy Mustard Greens, and Fresh Peas with Sage on Baked Ricotta showcase combinations that are simultaneously familiar and revelatory.

From Booklist
*Starred Review* Committed vegetarians will cheer over another book from the hands of Madison. One of the nation’s best-known vegetarian cooks, Madison has practiced her craft both at Alice Waters’ Chez Panisse and her own restaurant. Comprehensive and exhaustive, this new cookbook surveys the world of edible plant products in rigorous scientific groupings. Both text and color photographs educate readers to discover correlations and kinships and to explore how recipes adapt to encompass related ingredients. All of the nightshade family—eggplant, potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers—appear together. A sandwich of spinach, caramelized onions, and roasted peppers neighbors a sort of casserole assembled from little-known quelites (lamb’s quarters) and mushrooms layered with corn tortillas. Madison introduces even more curious vegetables, such as fourwing saltbush. Although most recipes fall into the vegan category, there are plenty of dairy products and eggs to broaden recipes’ appeal. Madison herself confesses partiality to tomatoes baked in cream. A necessary addition for both reference and circulating collections. --Mark Knoblauch

Jancis Robinson's award-winning books Vines, Grapes and Wine (1986) and the hugely successful Oxford Companion to Wine (1994, 1999, 2006), are landmarks in wine literature. Jancis is the Financial Times' wine correspondent and is critically acclaimed as the ""woman who makes the wine world gulp when she speaks"" (USA Today) and ""our favorite wine writer"" (Playboy).

An Introduction to My New Orleans from John Besh
Dear Friends,
This book is the story of a dreamy, starry-eyed boy brought up in the shadows of New Orleans, surrounded by cypress knees and tupelo trees, good dinners and great friends. My life has been dramatically shaped by our multicultural heritage. Everything that I cook and eat, see and smell, reminds me of where I come from and more or less dictates where I’m going.

""Somehow everything in my life ends up being about food,"" she realizes, as she begins the latest of her food-themed quilts. Her twin passions have converged in a brand-new position as head chef for Elm Creek Quilts, Waterford, Pennsylvania's popular quilting retreat.

As she joins the circle of quilters at historic Elm Creek Manor, Anna is eager to preserve the manor's culinary heritage, dating to 1858, while also celebrating the new favorites of their many guests. Yet as Master Quilter Sylvia Bergstrom Compson well knows, the manor's kitchen, last updated in the 1940s, can't create food that compares to the state-of-the-art quilting instruction for which Elm Creek Quilts is renowned.

A full renovation of the kitchen must be completed by the start of the new camp season. Though the task is daunting, Anna is assured in her belief that ""A kitchen is the heart of a home."" As she and Sylvia begin to dismantle the old to make way for the new, Sylvia's reminiscences remind them both of just how many of the manor's traditions have involved food and celebrations. Whether the feast is one of the holiday menus prepared and enjoyed by generations of Bergstroms, or one of the Welcome Banquets and Farewell Breakfasts that have become hallmarks of Elm Creek Quilt Camp, there is a story for every recipe, and a recipe for every story.

The Quilter's Kitchen follows Anna's flavorful explorations of the kitchens of Elm Creek Manor, past and present.

For the millions who watched, his announcement became a pivotal moment not only for the nation, but his family and wife.

Believing in Magic is the story of her marriage to Earvin nearly four decades of loving each other, losing their way, and eventually finding a path they never imagined.

Her work—novels, short stories, letters, and criticism—received a number of awards, including the National Book Award.

Les dîners de Gala, TASCHEN (Editor),4.8,217,,,43.4,"“Les diners de Gala is uniquely devoted to the pleasures of taste … If you are a disciple of one of those calorie-counters who turn the joys of eating into a form of punishment, close this book at once; it is too lively, too aggressive, and far too impertinent for you.”―Salvador Dalí
Food and surrealism make perfect bedfellows: sex and lobsters, collage and cannibalism, the meeting of a swan and a toothbrush on a pastry case. The opulent dinner parties thrown by Salvador Dalí (1904–1989) and his wife and muse, Gala (1894–1982) were the stuff of legend. Luckily for us, Dalí published a cookbook in 1973, Les diners de Gala, which reveals some of the sensual, imaginative, and exotic elements that made up their notorious gatherings.
This reprint features all 136 recipes over 12 chapters, specially illustrated by Dalí, and organized by meal courses, including aphrodisiacs. The illustrations and recipes are accompanied by Dalí’s extravagant musings on subjects such as dinner conversation: “The jaw is our best tool to grasp philosophical knowledge.”
All these rich recipes can be cooked at home, although some will require practiced skill and a well-stocked pantry. This is cuisine of the old school, with meals by leading French chefs from such stellar Paris restaurants as Lasserre, La Tour d’Argent, Maxim’s, and Le Train Bleu.
Good taste, however voluptuous, never goes out of fashion. In making this exceptionally rare book available to a wide audience, TASCHEN brings an artwork, a practical cookbook, and a multisensory adventure to today’s kitchens.The first English edition of Les Diners de Gala was published in 1973 by FELICIE, INC., New York",27114,"Review
“A mammoth tome whose lustrous gold cover hints at decadence to come.”

“Surrealist fans and kooky cooks will enjoy TASCHEN’s re-issue of Salvador Dalí’s 1973 cookbook, Les Dîners de Gala. Illustrated with Dalí’s bizarre, erotic work and dinner spreads shot in garish 1970s tones, this is a legitimate cookbook…”

“A surrealist, sensory treat.”

“Salvador Dalí’s exotic and imaginative cookbook, filled with the stuff your dreams (or possibly your nightmares) are made of.”

MAKING FREEZER COOKING A LIFESTYLE

Congratulations on taking your first freezer cooking quiz ever! If you're like we once were, you noticed a few gaps in your freezer cooking knowledge. No prob. As self-proclaimed (and tongue-in-cheek!) ""freezer cooking evangelists,"" we're passionate about resourcing you for this lifestyle change that will benefit you and your family over the long haul. In this section, we'll quickly motivate and set you up for success before you dive into filling that cold chest, addressing questions like: What are the advantages of freezer cooking? How should you freeze and thaw meals? What foods should you avoid freezing? How long can you freeze foods? Do I need a deep freezer?

FREEZER COOKING PART Y: A one-time event where a group gathers together to cook, assemble, and package a variety of freezer meals.

FREEZER CLUB: An ongoing small group of friends who commit to regularly cooking freezer-friendly meals for one another. Members prepare recipes at home on their own time and then swap at a meeting. We'll also equip you with two ways to share the freezer stocking load with friends, both at one-time Freezer Cooking Parties and in an ongoing Freezer Club. Learning to freezer cook on our own and with friends has positively transformed how we prepare food, shop, eat, and spend our time and money. We think this lifestyle shift will do the same for you, too. Let's get started on a change you won't regret!





Freezer cooking pays off over time, but there is a little bit of a learning curve. That's why, in this chapter, we're aiming to motivate you with the big picture of this lifestyle. Then, we'll walk you through six essential steps to making successful freezer meals, as well as address all your burning questions. From the very basics to the very specific, we are diving in and sharing everything we know.



As we mentioned in our own stories in the introduction, freezer cooking can help you and your family in so many ways. Wow, isn't it motivating to know that it provides all of the following benefits?

It's no secret that when you buy food in bulk quantities, it is usually cheaper. By planning your meals, especially in a Freezer Club (see page 25), and cooking in large quantities, you'll see your grocery bill go down significantly. We've found that when we cook this way, a four-serving meal tends to cost around $8 to $12 depending on the ingredients needed. This translates to about $2 to $3 per person for a wholesome, healthy meal. Plus, having ready-to-go meals within reach reduces the temptation to spend cash eating out. Who needs to wait for takeout when you have Turkey Pesto Paninis or Parmesan and Herb Chicken Tenders in the freezer, just a few minutes away from being piping hot?

Let's be honest. Cooking a well-rounded, healthy dinner every night is a daunting task for anyone. Deciding what to make, shopping, prepping, cooking, and cleaning up can sap the last bit of physical and mental energy you have after a long day. Add a few tired, grumpy kids to the mix, and the dinner hour can be quite a challenge. By having meals that you doubled from a previous meal or made with a group of friends (see Chapters 2 and 3) ready to go in the freezer, you'll cut down on all those extra little trips to the store during the week. Even more importantly, you'll reduce your prep, cooking, and cleanup time regularly, leaving weeknights freer to relax, spend time with your family, exercise, enjoy hobbies, or whatever else has been crowded out of your life by the daily cooking grind!

Freezer cooking, especially using the recipes in this book, makes homemade food full of real, wholesome ingredients readily available. We believe eating a healthy diet means consuming a variety of whole foods, ones that are closest to their natural state. Through research and our own experience, we've learned that when we consume real food-with an emphasis on lots of produce, whole grains, organic or local meats and dairy, wild- caught seafood, and healthy fats-our bodies tend to do what they are supposed to do. We have more energy, sleep better, avoid headaches and stomachaches, and feel comfortably full and stop from overeating more easily. Whole foods are the fuel our bodies are made to run on. The good news is that freezer cooking can help you eat more whole foods in two main ways. First, cooking from scratch allows you to control what goes into your food, thus avoiding loads of extra sodium, sugar, unhealthy fats, preservatives, additives, and food dyes that are packed into fast food and other processed, store-bought foods. Second, freezer cooking also means you will have nutritious, easy-to-prepare meals at your fingertips all the time, which results in fewer fast-food runs or prepackaged meal purchases. Once you learn how easy it is to stock your freezer, your family will be well on their way to eating a wide range of nutritious foods every day.

With freezer cooking, it's easy to have meals ready to go to take to new parents or others in need. Over the years, we have given many new moms, people in crisis, grandparents, college students, and even a man recently released from prison some extra freezer meals to bake or warm up at their convenience. With meals in the freezer, you can be that friend who shows up at someone's doorstep with a healthy dinner and a few words of encouragement. It's a simple act of caring and thoughtfulness that can make a bigger impact than you may realize. If you choose to freezer cook with friends, there are even more advantages to reap.

It's easy to fall into a rut and make the same meals on a regular rotation, isn't it? A Freezer Cooking Party or Freezer Club allows you to experience different kinds of cuisines, flavors, and ingredients that you may not normally prepare at home. This has been a great palate-expanding experience for our children (and husbands!). Even better, it has also allowed us to get more nutritional variety into our bodies and the bodies of our families.

Among other things, freezer cooking with friends can stretch you as a home cook. It has forced us to try our hand at all kinds of new recipes. As a result, our recipe repertoire and cooking skills have grown beyond anything we could have accomplished on our own. It's almost like taking a cooking class with your friends, but at the end you all leave as savvier, more experienced cooks with stocked freezers!

Last and certainly not least, we think freezer cooking with our friends is simply fun! At our Freezer Club meetings and Freezer Cooking Parties, we often have coffee, wine, snacks, and a great time hanging out together. To top it all off, you get to come home and fill your freezer to the brim with already-prepared healthy meals. It's the perfect night out, if you ask us!



Freezer cooking isn't especially hard, but there are a few keys to success. To get the tastiest results, keep these six simple steps in mind.





Rule #1 of freezer cooking is that what you put in is what you get out. Be sure to select only the freshest, high-quality foods to use in your freezer meals. If an ingredient didn't taste good to begin with, it certainly won't be better after freezing. Also keep in mind that some foods freeze and thaw much better than others. While it's safe to freeze most foods, the texture and taste of some are extremely compromised after being frozen and thawed, as the box on page 5 shows. Additionally, seasoning and spices can tend to get stronger when they sit in the freezer in a meal. Season lightly before freezing, and add additional seasonings when reheating or serving.

FOODS THAT TYPICALLY DON'T FREEZE AND THAW WELL

Note: Some of these ingredients will freeze well within a recipe. However, the texture may change if frozen as a single ingredient.

VEGETABLES: celery, cucumbers, lettuce, onions, bell peppers, potatoes, radishes, sprouts

FRUITS: apples, citrus fruits, grapes, melons

DAIRY: soft cheeses, cottage cheese, cream cheese, cream, custard, mayonnaise, sour cream, yogurt

OTHER: canned food still in cans, eggs in shells, fried foods, pasta cooked beyond al dente





It's important to let freshly cooked dishes cool before placing them in the freezer. There are a number of reasons for this. First, putting foods that are still warm in the freezer can raise the freezer's temperature. This can cause surrounding frozen items to partially thaw and refreeze, which can alter the taste and texture of those foods. Second, placing hot food in a plastic freezer bag or container can result in the plastic releasing chemicals into the food. Third, warm food freezes so slowly that ice crystals form on top, which can also alter the texture of the freezer meal. To avoid contamination while allowing food to cool, never let perishable food sit out on the counter for longer than 2 hours. To bring down the temperature more quickly, place partially cooled food in a shallow, wide container and refrigerate it, uncovered, until cold. Or, to chill soup or stew quickly, pour it into a metal bowl and set it in a larger bowl filled halfway with ice water. Stir occasionally.





There are multiple ways that meals can be stored in the freezer. Your freezing method will likely depend on the space in your freezer, the types of meals you make, and what containers you have on hand. Whatever method you choose, the goal is to prevent the food from being exposed to air, which can result in freezer burn. Freezer burn occurs when the moisture in the outer layers evaporates, leaving behind ""dry"" pockets. While it isn't harmful to eat freezer-burned food, the texture and flavor can be adversely affected. Wrapping food tightly and using the four freezing methods we recommend on page 8 will help keep freezer burn at bay. It's also helpful to label your meals so you know exactly what they are and how long they have been in the freezer. Affix a label to each container with the name of the dish, number of servings (or volume/weight), and the date you put it in the freezer.





The faster food freezes, the better its quality will be once it's defrosted. Slowly frozen food forms large ice crystals that may turn the food mushy. Here are some tips for freezing food quickly and at the right temperature: Store all foods at 0°F or lower to retain vitamin content, flavor, texture, and color. Use a freezer thermometer to ensure this. Do not crowd the freezer, so that there is enough room for air to circulate around food, allowing it to freeze rapidly. Never stack packages to be frozen. Instead, spread them out in one layer on various shelves, stacking them only after they're frozen solid. Store soups and stews in freezer bags, which can be placed flat and will freeze quickly. Store foods in small servings, when possible, to help them freeze quickly. This also allows you to defrost only what you need. A secondary freezer is not a necessity for freezer cooking, but it can be helpful if you want to make freezer cooking a lifestyle. It can actually store food at a more constant, lower temperature than a refrigerator's freezer, protecting the taste and texture of food longer. Plus, it provides room for stocking up on ingredients when they are on sale, saving produce when it is in season, and stacking up all of those freezer meals you'll be accumulating soon. A secondary freezer doesn't have to be huge and expensive, though. Simply start with a standard chest freezer. If you want something bigger, both of us have the Frigidaire Gallery 2-in-1 Upright Freezer and love it.





From a safety standpoint, food that is properly packaged and safely frozen (kept at a constant temperature of 0°F or lower) can be frozen indefinitely. Yes, indefinitely! However, even though something may be safe to eat, that doesn't mean it will taste its best after a long time in the freezer. The chart on page 10 provides some general guidelines for how long to freeze particular foods and still maintain their quality. These recommendations are conservative and somewhat subjective, to be honest. We have frozen food much longer than some of these times with good results. There are many variables that affect the amount of time food can be frozen (type of freezer, ingredients in the recipe, quality of the packaging, etc.), so it's hard to say exactly when a freezer meal will go ""bad.""

Delighting us with tales of his passion for cooking and good food and the people, places, and great meals he has experienced, Conroy mixes them together with mouthwatering recipes from the Deep South and the world beyond.

It all started thirty years ago with a chance purchase of The Escoffier Cookbook, an unlikely and daunting introduction for the beginner. But Conroy was more than up to the task. He set out with unwavering determination to learn the basics of French cooking—stocks and dough—and moved swiftly on to veal demi-glace and pâte brisée. With the help of his culinary accomplice, Suzanne Williamson Pollak, Conroy mastered the dishes of his beloved South as well as the cuisine he has savored in places as far away from home as Paris, Rome, and San Francisco.

Each chapter opens with a story told with the inimitable brio of the author. We see Conroy in New Orleans celebrating his triumphant novel The Prince of Tides at a new restaurant where there is a contretemps with its hardworking young owner/chef—years later he discovered the earnest young chef was none other than Emeril Lagasse; we accompany Pat and his wife on their honeymoon in Italy and wander with him, wonderstruck, through the markets of Umbria and Rome; we learn how a dinner with his fighter-pilot father was preceded by the Great Santini himself acting out a perilous night flight that would become the last chapters of one of his son’s most beloved novels. These tales and more are followed by corresponding recipes—from Breakfast Shrimp and Grits and Sweet Potato Rolls to Pappardelle with Prosciutto and Chestnuts and Beefsteak Florentine to Peppered Peaches and Creme Brulee. A master storyteller and passionate cook, Conroy believes that “A recipe is a story that ends with a good meal.”

“This book is the story of my life as it relates to the subject of food. It is my autobiography in food and meals and restaurants and countries far and near. Let me take you to a restaurant on the Left Bank of Paris that I found when writing The Lords of Discipline. There are meals I ate in Rome while writing The Prince of Tides that ache in my memory when I resurrect them. There is a shrimp dish I ate in an elegant English restaurant, where Cuban cigars were passed out to all the gentlemen in the room after dinner, that I can taste on my palate as I write this. There is barbecue and its variations in the South, and the subject is a holy one to me. I write of truffles in the Dordogne Valley in France, cilantro in Bangkok, catfish in Alabama, scuppernong in South Carolina, Chinese food from my years in San Francisco, and white asparagus from the first meal my agent took me to in New York City. Let me tell you about the fabulous things I have eaten in my life, the story of the food I have encountered along the way. . . ”",158584,"Review
“The Pat Conroy Cookbook is more than just that. It’s a virtual “Ode to Joy.” Read it; cook from it. You will eat better than you ever have in your life, and will know more about Pat Conroy, perhaps, than he would ever tell you.” 
— Anne Rivers Siddons

As she explores this utterly delectable and distinctive cuisine, Lidia shows us that every kitchen is different, every Italian community distinct, and little clues are buried in each dish: the Sicilian-style semolina bread and briny olives in New Orleans Muffuletta Sandwiches, the Neapolitan crust of New York pizza, and mushrooms (abundant in the United States, but scarce in Italy) stuffed with breadcrumbs, just as peppers or tomatoes are. Lidia shows us how this cuisine is an original American creation and gives recognition where it is long overdue to the many industrious Italians across the country who have honored the traditions of their homeland in a delicious new style.

And of course, there are Lidia’s irresistible recipes, including
·        Baltimore Crab Cakes
·        Pittsburgh’s Primanti’s Sandwiches
·        Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza
·        Eggplant Parmigiana from the Bronx
·        Gloucester Baked Halibut
·        Chicken Trombino from Philadelphia
·        authentic Italian American Meatloaf, and Spaghetti and Meatballs
·        Prickly Pear Granita from California
·        and, of course, a handful of cheesecakes and cookies that you’d recognize in any classic Italian bakery

Gabrielle Raiz is an author, a keen foodie and health-loving educator who perhaps surprisingly started her working life as a dentist. She has a knack for making things practical and understandable and has a flexible approach to her food and her yoga.

Gabrielle has recently expanded her food writing to publish 2 top selling books ""Green Smoothie Magic"" and ""132+ Delicious Salads, Dressings and Dips"". All of her recipes are fuss-free adaptable recipes which most importantly use easy to find ingredients that anyone can make. Some embody beautiful simplicity of 1 or 2 ingredients while others are marvellously complex, but never hard to make!

Gabrielle's talent as an author was crystallized through much online writing and of course with the publishing of her highly successful first book: ""Hot Yoga MasterClass"" (which is now finally, recently available on Amazon).

Her hallmark style has an easy, intelligent and conversational tone with a touch of humor!

In both her currently chosen fields (!) of nutrition and yoga she has built a solid reputation for creating products of beauty and above all, quality. ""What you eat and how you move are 2 fields in which being mindful and present are vital"", Gabrielle says. ""I love that I help people do both!""

As the ""Hot Yoga Doctor"" she helps tens of thousands of people every month in every corner of the planet improve their yoga practices by demystifying all things yoga, hot yoga and Bikram Yoga™.

Something you may not know about Gabrielle (and rather unusual for a yoga instructor) is that she used to race motorcycles! But as she's been known to say ""the last time I rode a motorbike was to go and buy a pregnancy testing kit"". Her daughter is now 10!

Breakfast
 
Breakfast is the meal most of us choose to skip. Yet it is the meal most needed to get your day off to an energized start. Assuming you have gone all night without food or water, you should be feeling your tummy by now. In fact, with regular Clean Eating, you may even be awakened by a tummy demanding food.
 
The only answer is to fill it with delicious Clean-Eating breakfast options such as Swiss Muesli (Chaper 1: Breakfast), an Oh-My-Gosh Omelet (Chaper 1: Breakfast) or an Egg White and Turkey Scramble (Chaper 1: Breakfast). These breakfast choices are so satisfying, lean and mighty, you won’t ever skip breakfast again.
 
CROCK-POT PORRIDGE
Whole grains are essential for building strong, lean bodies. What better way to start your day than with a crock pot loaded with the best of the body-building whole grains? Set it all up the night before, plug in and wake up to “instant” home-cooked goodness. Jazz up the porridge with fresh berries, flax seed, wheat germ and bee pollen. Guess who’s buff now?
 
INGREDIENTS:
½ cup / 120 ml cracked wheat
1½ cup / 360 ml steel-cut oats
½ cup / 120 ml rye flakes
½ cup / 120 ml brown rice
¼ cup / 60 ml wheat germ
6½ cups / 1.5 L water or any combination of liquids including rice milk, soy milk, almond milk, goat’s milk and/or water to equal 6½ cups

COTTAGE CHEESE PANCAKES
Raise the Bar reader, Laura Wilkins, shared her favorite childhood pancake recipe with me. Her version called for two tablespoons of sugar but I substituted maple sugar flakes as a healthier Clean-Eating sweetening ingredient. It is an excellent Clean-Eating pancake recipe because it calls for nonfat cottage cheese, which is an excellent source of lean protein, as is the fat-free yogurt. Egg whites make the pancakes fluffy and a good source of protein. Yum!
 
INGREDIENTS:
Dry:
1¼ cups / 300 ml whole-wheat flour
1 tsp / 5 ml baking powder
2 Tbsp / 30 ml maple sugar flakes
½ tsp / 2.5 ml ground cinnamon
¼ tsp / 1.25 ml sea salt
Wet:
8 egg whites
1 cup / 240 ml fat-free cottage cheese
1 cup / 240 ml fat-free plain yogurt
Eat-Clean Cooking Spray*

POWER OATMEAL PANCAKES
Everyone loves pancakes. This light fluffy cake-like breakfast food is traditionally eaten with gobs of butter and syrup. None of this makes for Clean Eating. Try this delicious variation, which is sure to please the palate as well as the waistline.
 
INGREDIENTS:
6 egg whites, beaten until fluffy
½ cup / 120 ml low-fat cottage cheese
1 scoop protein powder

½ tsp / 2.5 ml cinnamon
Eat-Clean Cooking Spray (see Chaper 1: Breakfast: COTTAGE CHEESE PANCAKES)
 
PREPARATION:
1 Place all ingredients except beaten egg whites in a food processor and pulse or blend until mixture is uniform.
 
2 Pour blended ingredients into a bowl and add the egg whites. Fold until just blended.
 
3 Prepare a griddle with cooking spray. Ladle pancake mixture onto griddle and cook until both sides are browned.
 
How do you eat pancakes Clean-Eating style?
Skip the syrup and place a dollop of unsweetened applesauce on each pancake. Or you can try this little trick: Place ½ cup of blueberries or raspberries in a small saucepan along with 1 tablespoon of water. Mash the berries and bring the mixture to a boil. When the fruit is uniformly hot and beginning to get syrupy, remove from heat and pour into a small jug. Drizzle over pancakes. Delicious!

Chocolate-Peanut Butter Brownies

¾ cup (1½  sticks) unsalted butter
8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped into small pieces
4 large eggs
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
¼ teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons smooth peanut butter
¾ cup semisweet chocolate chips
 
Makes 16 brownies
 
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a 9-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, extending it up and over the sides on 2 sides.

Select a saucepan and a heatproof bowl that fits snugly on top of the pan. Fill the pan one-third full of water, making sure the water doesn’t touch the bottom of the bowl. Ask an adult to help you place the saucepan over medium heat. When the water is steaming, place the bowl on top of the saucepan and add the butter and chocolate to the bowl. Heat, stirring with a rubber spatula, until the mixture is melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Don’t let the chocolate get too hot! Ask an adult to help you remove the bowl from the saucepan (the bowl will be hot!) and set aside to cool slightly.

In a bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the eggs on medium speed until pale, about 4 minutes. Add the sugar and vanilla and beat until well combined. Turn off the mixer. Add the chocolate and beat until blended. Turn off the mixer and scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula. Stir in the flour and salt with the rubber spatula just until blended.

Scrape the batter into the pan and smooth the top. Using a tablespoon measure, drop 6 dollops of peanut butter over the top, spacing them evenly. Sprinkle with the chocolate chips. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (ask an adult for help!), 25 to 30 minutes. Ask an adult to help you remove the pan from the oven and put it on a wire rack. Let cool completely, then cut into 16 squares and serve.

Before stunning the world with his bestselling Kitchen Confidential, Anthony Bourdain, host of the celebrated TV shows Parts Unknown and No Reservations, spent years serving some of the best French brasserie food in New York. With its no-nonsense, down-to-earth atmosphere, Les Halles matched Bourdain's style perfectly: a restaurant where you can dress down, talk loudly, drink a little too much wine, and have a good time with friends. Now, Bourdain brings you his Les Halles Cookbook, a cookbook like no other: candid, funny, audacious, full of his signature charm and bravado.
Bourdain teaches you everything you need to know to prepare classic French bistro fare. While you're being guided, in simple steps, through recipes like roasted veal short ribs and steak frites, escargots aux noix and foie gras au pruneaux, you'll feel like he's in the kitchen beside you-reeling off a few insults when you've scorched the sauce, and then patting you on the back for finally getting the steak tartare right.
As practical as it is entertaining, Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles Cookbook is a can't-miss treat for cookbook lovers, aspiring chefs, and Bourdain fans everywhere.",25084,"From Publishers Weekly
A celebrity with a high-profile position as executive chef at New York bistro Les Halles, and bestselling author of Kitchen Confidential and A Cook's Tour, Bourdain doesn't intend to break new ground. The dishes do exactly as the subtitle notes and include such solid classic fare as Onion Soup Les Halles, Steak au Poivre, Boeuf Bourguignon, Coq au Vin and Chocolate Mousse. Nearly all recipes are within reach of competent home cooks, and those that are more complicated or time-consuming—Bouillabaisse, Cassoulet and Roulade of Wild Pheasant—are thoroughly spelled out to calm most jitters. Foie gras, duck fat and dark veal stock are frequent components, but a list of suppliers makes just about every ingredient available. Even though many of the dishes can be found in other cookbooks, what sets this one apart is Bourdain's signature wise-ass attitude that pervades nearly every recipe, explanatory note and chapter introduction. Profanity adds frequent color. If Aunt Doris would blanche at pearl onions being called ""little fuckers,"" a cook who prefers boneless meat in Daube Provençal a ""poor deluded bastard,"" or a person nervous about making these recipes a ""dipshit,"" this book is not for her.

Trying out a new diet is an exciting moment, but it can be quite stressful at the same time. There will be things that you will have to increase, remove, or simply add to your existing meals. Sometimes changing to a new diet can be as dramatic as requiring you to clear out your entire kitchen cabinet and buying new ingredients, or it can be as simple as just buying one or two ingredients.
The Ketogenic or “Keto” diet is a diet that has been slowly gaining momentum over the last few years. It is a high-fat diet that is low in carbohydrates and moderates in protein. It provides an almost perfect macro-nutrient ratio which makes it easy for the body to switch effortlessly from using fat to using carbohydrates.
The human body is highly dependent on both fat and carbohydrates for energy to fuel it throughout the day. What’s fascinating about the Keto diet is that it can encourage the body to burn fat more rapidly. Scientists have for many years have noted that fat is solely responsible for weight gain, and weight gain is associated with multiple illnesses like obesity, Diabetes, and Epilepsy in children.
Not only are the ingredients important, but so too is the method in which you use to prepare your foods. There are many kitchen appliances that can make this process a heck of a lot easier. With each passing day, air fryers are becoming more popular for the wonders they can create. You can make all your favorite dishes in an absolutely healthy way with air fryers. Are you intrigued? An air fryer is a must-have kitchen appliance that will ensure food is cooked through the circulation of hot air within the chamber. There is a mechanical fan present in the air fryer that circulates this hot air at high speed around the food. Instead of using gallons of oil, an air fryer needs only a few drops.
In this book, more will be explored on the Keto diet using the wonderful Air Fryer.

""Consider this a companion to 'The Joy of Cooking,' with recipes that run from the basic to creatively unusual. Sidebars on storage and equipment, step-by-step illustrations on more difficult techniques and taste-test results done in the Cook's Illustrated kitchen--it's all here. The information is exact and even scientific, but reader-friendly. For those who want good recipes that work and also want to expand their knowledge of how and why things work, this is a fascinating book. (The Black and White Chocolate Chip Cookies with Pecans tested in The Times kitchen may actually be the best chocolate-chip cookies ever.)"" -- The Seattle Times, December 8, 1999

""The folks at Cook's Illustrated magazine have compiled a fine collection of recipes that have been tested not once, not twice, but many more times, to find the absolutely best version....This is a great choice for cooks who want to know the 'whys' of cooking: why you should roast beef at a low temperature, why you should use high heat for eggs, and so forth."" -- The New York Daily News, December 8, 1999

""This gastronomic classic belongs on every serious cook's shelf."" -- The Christian Science Monitor, December 8, 1999

""This is the perfectionist's 'Joy of Cooking.'"" -- The Amherst Bulletin, November 26, 1999

""[T]he more than 700 recipes compiled within The Best Recipe represent a range of culinary strains from a Southern Baked Country Ham to Italian Shrimp Scampi to a Middle Eastern Tabbouleh and French inspired Chilled Lemon Souffle. You'll find basic staples as well as more esoteric ones, dishes that regardless of their pedigree represent how we eat today or better yet the foods we crave these days. The Best Recipe is without question one of the best cookery books published this year and is the book I'll be giving to my foodie friends this holiday season."" --

“Many of the bonds my family has were forged over the dinner table and through the sharing of recipes. Cooking is the way we express our love for one another....I feel so lucky and blessed by the strong support and wonderful memories—and the incredible recipes—that my family has brought me. They are the heart and soul of this book.”

—from the Introduction

Nothing is more important to Paula Deen than her family, and nothing makes that big family happier than sitting down to a meal together.

Paula's beloved Aunt Peggy makes an Old-Fashioned Meat Loaf that's as good in sandwiches the next day as it is for dinner. Baby brother Bubba Hiers brings his Beer and Onion Biscuits to the table, and his daughter, Corrie, makes a simple but luscious Lemony, Buttery Baked Fish that's perfect for a weeknight dinner. (Her Carrot-Pecan Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting are pretty tasty, too!) Son Jamie makes Huevos Rancheros, perfect for brunch, or try Bobby's Whole Wheat and Honey Pancakes. Husband Michael Groover knows his way around a grill: try his Company's Coming Grilled Steak and Veggie Supper for easy entertaining, and finish the evening with his Irish Coffee.

Of course, there was no way The Lady herself was going to let her relatives have all the fun: Paula is, after all, Paula. She shares her recipe for the Ham and Chutney Biscuit Fingers she puts on the table at every family party as well as the Eggplant and Sausage Lasagna that went a long way toward getting the boys to eat their vegetables. And while there's plenty of butter, bacon, and mayonnaise in these pages, you'll find some of the lighter recipes that Paula enjoys, too: Seared Scallops with Pineapple-Cucumber Salsa is her first choice for a healthful but romantic supper with Michael, and Oven-Fried Chicken Breasts with Honey-Yogurt Drizzle lets Paula indulge in her favorite foods without guilt and with room for dessert.

With more than 140 recipes and dozens of beautiful color photographs, there's something here for everyone. So invite over all those aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends, and treat them to some home cooking, Deen family style.",198965,"From Booklist
Is there anyone still left out there who doesn’t know the ever-ebullient Paula Deen? This Savannah restaurateur appears all over television and has even garnered a movie role. Somehow, she still finds time to generate cookbooks. In her newest effort, she draws heavily on recipes from her large extended family. Her sons, who appear with their mother regularly, have started families of their own, and readers now meet a whole host of aunts, uncles, cousins, and other kin, each of whom seems to have a magic touch in the kitchen. Son Bobby contributes a healthy baked chicken with lime and mustard. Niece Corrie reaches outside the southern tradition for some Thai-inspired dishes. Aunt Peggy’s meat loaf boosts the classic hamburger-and-oatmeal version. Friend Katie Lee Joel offers a pumpkin pancake. Alan Richardson’s photos of the Deen family enhance the intimate, homey atmosphere. --Mark Knoblauch

Go on a fun, flavorful tour through the world of craft brews with one of the most unique and fascinating voices in beer today.

It's a great time to be a beer drinker, but also the most confusing, thanks to the dizzying array of available draft beers. Expert Joshua Bernstein comes to the rescue with The Complete Beer Course, demystifying the sudsy stuff and breaking down the elements that make a beer's flavor spin into distinctively different and delicious directions. Structured around a series of easy-to-follow classes, his course hops from lagers and pilsners to hazy wheat beers, Belgian-style abbey and Trappist ales, aromatic pale ales and bitter IPAs, roasty stouts, barrel-aged brews, belly-warming barley wines, and mouth-puckering sour ales. There is even a class on international beer styles and another on pairing beer with food and starting your own beer cellar. Through suggested, targeted tastings, you'll learn when to drink down-and when to dump those suds down a drain.",26754,"Review
""Bernstein has written a book that will take the reader from 'beer novice' to 'intrepid and informed explorer' in no time flat.""--Garrett Oliver, Brooklyn Brewery brewmaster and editor-in-chief of The Oxford Companion to Beer

""It might be the best craft-beer book of 2013. But it is also, more important, both the product of a beer-centric age and a solution to its challenges—and, if we're lucky, an indication that beer writing is evolving to suit the needs of a broader audience."" —Washington Post
 "". . . covers a variety of beer-related topics, including a nice breakdown on specific hops, terms glossary, a list of brew weeks by state and more.” —Cleveland Plain Dealer
 ""Structured as a 12-part course spanning the world of beers, this tome is terrifically comprehensive. Brooklyn-based beer expert and journalist Bernstein (brewed awakening: behind the beers and brewers leading the world's craft brewing revolution) shares his immense appreciation for a remarkable variety of beers. The result is appealingly chatty writing that, while definitely reading as a progression through what the author calls a 'boot camp,' is also encyclopedic in nature. Readers may be familiar with common styles such as ales and lagers but are likely to emerge keen to seek out less well-known tipples such as milk stout or gose (a salty, German style). The chapters are balanced between a focus on more typical representations of styles and niche varieties, and Bernstein suggests many favorites for the reader to taste while reading. Spotlights on particular breweries and beers and lavish illustrations make this book as enjoyable to flip through randomly as to read from start to finish. Verdict a wide-ranging volume that is sure to appeal to beer enthusiasts and casual consumers alike. Highly recommended for public libraries and collections with a focus on food and beverages."" — (STARRED REVIEW)

From the Inside Flap
Go on a fun, flavorful tour through the world of craft brews with one of the most unique and fascinating voices in beer today. In this thoroughly up-to-date, comprehensive, and utterly witty beer course (the only one currently available in print), Joshua M. Bernstein demystifies beer by ""elementally breaking down the grains, yeast, hops, and techniques that cause beer's flavor to spin into thousands of distinctively delicious directions.""
            Not only has the work of Bernstein, a highly acclaimed beer expert, appeared in publications such as the New York Times and Imbibe, but he also leads a New York City tour of homebrewers' apartments and lofts as well as lectures around America. Now he has created this complete course for anyone who wants to choose from and enjoy the vast array of singular brews available today. 
            After giving you the tools to taste, smell, and evaluate beers, Bernstein takes you through a series of easy-to-understand classes that will have you hopping from lagers and pilsners to hazy wheat beers, Belgian-style abbey and Trappist ales, aromatic pale ales and bitter IPAs, roasty stouts, barrel-aged brews, belly-warming barley wines, and mouth-puckering sour ales. A sequence of suggested, targeted tastings will help you distinguish appropriate flavors and those that ""signify that you should dump those beers down a drain."" Features on the world's most visionary breweries, a glossary of terms, a chapter on pairing beer with food and starting your own beer cellar, an informative chart on hops, and a calendar of craft beer weeks complete the course.
            ""Years of experience and sampling have given me the confidence to pass on certain beers, and seek out others as rabidly as my dog does a chicken bone,""writes Bernstein. ""The key is being armed with the necessary knowledge. That means learning the ropes, loosening your lips, and trying one beer after another, and another. Something tells me you'll like taking The Complete Beer Course, where earning extra credit has never been so much fun.""

Sous vide is the culinary innovation that has everyone in the food world talking. In this revolutionary new cookbook, Thomas Keller, America's most respected chef, explains why this foolproof technique, which involves cooking at precise temperatures below simmering, yields results that other culinary methods cannot. For the first time, one can achieve short ribs that are meltingly tender even when cooked medium rare. Fish, which has a small window of doneness, is easier to finesse, and shellfish stays succulent no matter how long it's been on the stove. Fruit and vegetables benefit, too, retaining color and flavor while undergoing remarkable transformations in texture.

The secret to sous vide is in discovering the precise amount of heat required to achieve the most sublime results. Through years of trial and error, Keller and his chefs de cuisine have blazed the trail to perfection—and they show the way in this collection of never-before-published recipes from his landmark restaurants—The French Laundry in Napa Valley and per se in New York. With an introduction by the eminent food-science writer Harold McGee, and artful photography by Deborah Jones, who photographed Keller's best-selling The French Laundry Cookbook, this book will be a must for every culinary professional and anyone who wants to up the ante and experience food at the highest level.",38084,"Amazon.com Review
The ground-breaking under-pressure method, usually called sous vide, involves submerging food for minutes or even days in sealed, airless bags at precisely the temperature required to produce perfect doneness. Flavors and textures unattainable by other cooking methods can also be achieved.
The technique has been in the pipeline for awhile--one forerunner is the boil-in bag mom used to put veggies on the table--but has only recently attracted top chefs. One is Thomas Keller, famed chef-proprietor of The French Laundry and Per Se. His mightily sized, gorgeously produced Under Pressure explores every inch of sous vide, including the ramifications of using this precision-cooking technique (once time and temperature are established, best results follow automatically) on the craft of cooking, which has always meant a potentially rewarding engagement with the possibility of failure.
The book makes no bones about being addressed to professionals. Typical recipes, like Marinated Toy Box Tomatoes with Compressed Cucumber-Red Onion Relish, Toasted Brioche, and Diane St. Claire Butter, involve multiple preparations and dernier cri ingredients, and thus resist home duplication. There’s also the matter of the pricey equipment required--chamber vacuum packers and temperature-maintaining immersion circulators--not to mention the precautions required to ensure that foods, usually cooked at low temps, are safe to eat.
What the book does offer the home cook is, however, thrilling. It introduces something new under the sun--an exciting, transformative technique of great potential. Anyone interested in food and cooking--not to mention lovers of extraordinarily well produced books--will want to explore Under Pressure. --Arthur Boehm
From Publishers Weekly
The origins of sous vide cooking, or vacuum-packing foods and cooking them at precise, relatively low temperatures for long periods, may have been largely in frozen convenience foods, but it has become standard in top kitchens worldwide, notably Kellers own. Now, Keller aims to demonstrate the technique to a wider swath of cooks—not the masses, but at least those who can afford this lavish volume and the sous vide equipment. One need not cook the exact recipes (which are unaltered from the restaurants) to be inspired by Kellers careful yet whimsical creations, such as a cuttlefish tagliatelle with palm hearts and nectarine or squab with piquillo peppers, marcona almonds, fennel and date sauce. And Keller, with several of his chefs as well as curious cook Harold McGee, takes pains in the introduction to explain sous vide fundamentals, arguing persuasively that it is not a fad but an important technique that allows unparalleled control over how ingredients are heated and what flavors and textures result. Still, at least until the equipment is more affordable, most readers will admire this gorgeous book on their coffee tables, from the simple beauty of photos of ingredients in their natural states to plates with a courses elements so artfully arranged they would not be out of place in a modern art museum.

Here, in convincing fashion, Judith Jones demonstrates that cooking for yourself presents unparalleled possibilities for both pleasure and experimentation: you can utilize whatever ingredients appeal, using farmers’ markets and specialty shops to enrich your palate and improve your health; you can feel free to fail, since a meal for one doesn’t have to be perfect; and you can use leftovers to innovate—in the course of a week, the remains of beef bourguignon might be reimagined as a ragù, pork tenderloin may become a stir-fry, a cup or two of wild rice produces both a refreshing pilaf and a rich pancake, and red snapper can be reinvented as a summery salad. It’s a fulfilling and immensely economical process, one perfectly suited for our times—although, as Jones points out, cooking for one also means we can occasionally indulge ourselves in a favorite treat.

Throughout, Jones is both our instructor and our mentor, suggesting basic recipes—such as tomato sauce, preserved lemons, pesto, and homemade stock—that all cooks should have on hand; teaching us how to improvise using an ingenious strategy of building meals through the week; and supplying us with a lifetime’s worth of tips and shortcuts. From Child’s advice for buying fresh meat to Beard’s challenge to beginning crêpe-makers and Lidia Bastianich’s tips for cooking perfectly sauced pasta, Jones’s book presents a wealth of acquired knowledge from our finest cooks.

Make this rich stew on a leisurely weekend. You’ll probably get a good three meals out of it, if you follow some of the suggestions below. When buying stew meat at a supermarket, you don’t always know what you are getting, so ask the butcher. If it’s a lean meat, it will need less time cooking (in fact, it will be ruined if you cook it too long), but the fattier cuts can benefit from at least another half hour. --Judith Jones

From Publishers Weekly
Longtime Knopf editor and executive Jones follows up her recent food memoir with this civilized, unfussy guide to cooking—and cooking well—for solitary diners, for those... who want to roll up [their] sleeves and enjoy, from day to day, one of the great satisfactions of life. Forming and revising cooking strategy is a cornerstone of her digressive, folksy approach, so she provides lists of equipment deemed essential, suggestions for dealing with packaging that coerces individuals into buying—and then wasting—more than necessary, and tips for storing spoilage-prone foods. Her other key to enjoying cooking—while reducing the costs of eating—is flexibility. She shares her personal credo about culinary language and exactness, and with many protein-based dishes includes ideas for variations and second and third rounds, as she refers to leftovers. She doesn't skip desserts, entertaining or self-indulgence, and best of all, her whole book benefits from the diverse and cumulative gleanings of work with many of the great cooks and cookbook writers (including Julia Child, of course) of the latter half of the 20th century.

“Sass makes it clear that good food can not only be delicious, but instantaneous and healthful for eaters as well as the planet… Anyone who doesn’t own a pressure cooker will want one right away.” (Marion Nestle, professor of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at New York University and author of What to Eat)

“In her classic book, Lorna Sass dazzles us with her time- and energy-saving techniques and fabulous recipes, from soup to risotto, brisket to cheesecake. Bravo!” (Peter Berley, author of Fresh Food Fast)

From the Back Cover
From the leading authority on speed cooking comes the groundbreaking cookbook that inspired a generation of cooks—now updated and revised for today's tastes and sleek, ultrasafe machines
From the elegant to the ethnic to the traditional, Cooking Under Pressure contains a wealth of flavor-packed recipes for fast, healthy, and delicious meals developed for the modern pressure cooker—a magical appliance that turns out foods in one-third (or less) the standard cooking time without sacrificing flavor or aroma. Lorna Sass introduces us to an eclectic array of dishes that can be prepared on a whim, including classic osso buco (18 minutes), chicken gumbo (9 minutes), and risotto (4 minutes, without stirring!). Even chocolate cheesecake and Grand Marnier bread pudding are done to perfection in short order. Plus, the dramatically shortened cooking times make it possible to prepare cholesterol-free, high-fiber ingredients such as grains and beans at the last minute. The pressure cooker is the cook's best friend!

In Bette Hagman's three earlier cookbooks, she worked with gluten-free flours that are safe for celiacs (those who are intolerant to gluten) and for those with wheat allergies, to create recipes that actually taste good. Knowing from her own hard-won experience that bread is the greatest loss for the wheat, oats, rye, or barley intolerant, she has experimented with exciting new bean-based flours and now devotes an entire book to breads. Here are yeast breads, yeast-free breads, muffins, rolls, buns, breakfast breads, and crackers-a veritable cornucopia to be made in the oven or the bread machine for people who cannot buy breads at a bakery or supermarket but must rely on their own kitchens to provide the staff of life.
Along with dozens of great recipes comes a medical foreword by Peter H. R. Green, M.D., of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University; a beginner's guide to understanding and cooking with gluten-free flours; answers to commonly asked questions about baking with these flours; and a source list of where to buy gluten-free baking supplies.

“Wolke, longtime professor of chemistry and author of the Washington Post column Food 101, turns his hand to a Cecil Adams style compendium of questions and answers on food chemistry. Is there really a difference between supermarket and sea salt? How is sugar made? Should cooks avoid aluminum pans? Interspersed throughout Wolke’s accessible and humorous answers to these and other mysteries are recipes demonstrating scientific principles.

Nothing promises pleasure more readily than the words ""freshly baked."" And nothing says magnum opus as definitively as Baking with Julia, which offers the dedicated home cook, whether a novice or seasoned veteran, a unique distillation of the baker's art.
Baking with Julia is not only a book full of glorious recipes but also one that continues Julia's teaching tradition. Here, basic techniques come alive and are made easily comprehensible in recipes that demonstrate the myriad ways of raising dough, glazing cakes, and decorating crusts. This is the resource you'll turn to again and again for all your baking needs. With Baking with Julia in your cookbook library, you can become a master baker.
And there's no better time to be baking than now. Quality baking today is more varied, more exciting, and simply more authentic than ever before. Baking with Julia celebrates this tremendous range with enticing recipes that marry sophisticated European techniques to American tastes and ingredients. With creative flair, napoleons are layered with tropical fruits, pumpkin and cranberries are kneaded into bread doughs, and a tart is topped with sweet stewed onions. Along the way, step-by-step photographs demonstrate the basic building blocks of the pastry and bread baker's repertoire, and from this firm foundation fancy takes flight.
Baking with Julia presents an extraordinary assemblage of talent, knowledge, and artistry from the new generation of bakers whose vision is so much a part of this book. The list of contributors reads like a Who's Who of today's master bakers, including Flo Braker, Steve Sullivan, Marcel Desaulniers, Nick Malgieri, Alice Medrich, Nancy Silverton, Martha Stewart, and a host of bright new talents such as Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid.
With nearly two hundred recipes, and half as many pages of tantalizing full-color photographs, this incomparable kitchen companion goes far beyond what most cookbooks offer. More than fifty pages of illustrated reference sections define basic terms and techniques, and explain the hows and whys of batters and doughs to take you effortlessly through the essential techniques. If you've never made flaky pie crust, your first no-fail experience is at hand. If you've never baked bread, that most satisfying and sensual pleasure awaits the turn of a page. With recipes for breads, pastries, cookies, and cakes—from chocolate to cheesecake, from miniature gems to multi-tiered masterpieces—this cookbook is a total immersion experience in the wonder of home baking.",52102,"Amazon.com Review
Television cooking shows are occasionally moderately entertaining to watch, but as sources for usable recipes and good cooking ideas, they are hit or miss at best. Cookbooks based on cooking shows are even less likely to be useful in the kitchen. One shining exception is Julia Child's ""Master Chef"" series. One of the best cooking shows ever produced, it also yielded some wonderful cookbooks, including Cooking With Master Chefs. The latest is Baking With Julia, which features the creations of 26 top bakers. All are artists with flour, eggs, butter, and the other ingredients of their craft. Writer Dorie Greenspan is a master at her craft as well. The paste for eclairs, she writes, is transformed from ""ordinary-looking batter"" into ""a puffed pastry that appears to be threatening flight."" It's all definitely good enough to eat.
From Publishers Weekly
Julia Child's newest TV series is a 39-part ""full course in the art of baking."" Here Greenspan (Waffles from Morning to Midnight) delivers the textbook for the course. The syllabus is comprehensive, covering breads, morning pastries, cakes, cookies, pies and savory pastries. The French classics?baguette, croissant, genoise, savarin, madeleines?are all present, but so are focaccia, pita, cobbler, rugelach and biscotti. This variety owes much to 27 ""baker-professors"" called on to instruct in their specialties. Steve Sullivan creates artisanal baguettes and couronnes; Beatrice Ojakangas prepares Danish Pastry and Swedish Limpa; Alice Medrich presents a Chocolate Ruffle Cake; Jeffrey Alfond and Naomi Duguid bake Persian Nan and other flatbreads; Lauren Groveman makes bagels and bialys; and Martha Stewart crafts a wedding cake decorated with marzipan fruit. Greenspan presents the nearly 200 recipes in classic Julia style; each recipe is clear, complete and comes with preparation and storage information. But the student-baker will need equipment and patience to match their efforts: many recipes rely on a heavy duty mixer, and some techniques will take repeated effort to master. For the ambitious, the adventurous and the simply appreciative, Baking with Julia is a course worth taking and a cookbook worth owning. BOMC/Good Cook selection; author (Ms. Child) tour.

What starts out as a few egg-laying chickens leads to turkeys, geese, and ducks. And not long after, along came two 300-pound pigs. And no, these charming and eccentric animals aren’t pets. Novella is raising these animals for dinner.

CHAPTER 1

THE BULLETPROOF PRINCIPLES

Maybe you're reading this book and already biohacking your way to Bullet proof living. You may listen to every episode of Bulletproof Radio, read every word on the Bulletproof blog, and constantly refine your program to achieve optimal performance. You may even decide to skip straight to the recipes because you've seen the incredible results the Bulletproof approach offers, and you just can't wait to get straight to the delicious Bulletproof food. And that's OK. However, whether you're new to Bulletproof or an experienced biohacker, take the time to read this opening chapter as a reminder of why we do what we do, and a refresher for the basic principles that define being Bulletproof.

First and foremost, this is a cookbook, a collection of Bulletproof recipes designed to make eating within the plan easy and satisfying, not to mention enjoyable. But before we roll up our sleeves to get into ingredients and food preparation, I'd like to underscore the foundational ideas that informed the creation of the recipes and also answer some common questions about the Bulletproof Diet. If you're new to all things Bulletproof, this chapter will give you a solid orientation to the philosophy, research, and goals that lead to the Bulletproof state of high performance. These are lessons with the power to change your life. Becoming Bulletproof isn't a quick fix or a fad; it's a new way to understand your physical state and tweak it to bring out unforeseen levels of energy and functionality.

It's not about being invincible. It's about adding so much to your energy and willpower reserves that you feel you can ""bring it"" no matter what life brings your way. For me, when I weighed 300 £ds, I honestly felt I didn't have that strength or control. Now, my joy and potential feel limitless. Becoming Bulletproof is about your true resilience, and realizing that you can do anything you set out to accomplish.

So before we get into recipes, let me outline the top tenets of the approach, and boil it down to basics to help organize the most important takeaways. The following sections will give you a good 101 understanding of what it is we're doing here, and why it works. From the top, here are the most common questions I'm asked about the Bulletproof Diet.

WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE BULLETPROOF?

Becoming Bulletproof is, in the simplest terms, about making you the most powerful being you can be, in terms of physical performance, brain power, and all-day energy. That means getting the very best out of your body and brain, all of the time. When I started this quest, I weighed 300 £ds. And while I was a fabulously successful entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, my physical and mental state was in sad shape. Because I had a background in tech, I understood the concept of hacking in a very real way. I had personal experience encountering barriers and boundaries and learning how to decode and work around them. So I employed that same approach in trying to figure out and conquer my weight problem and foggy brain. I believed on a gut level that there were ways to decode my system and create workarounds that would give me greater control over my system--not to outsmart it, but to understand its inner workings and optimize the functionality that my body, in its best state, could deliver.

As it turned out, this approach changed my life--and the lives of hundreds of thousands of people after me. All of my methods are driven by the idea that we are constantly refining and learning about what works for us personally, and making small tweaks--just as one does in technology--to make our bodies smarter, stronger, and more robust. There is no magic bullet. But if you can reset your body to cut your cravings, you'll change the state of your body and mind.

WILL THE BULLETPROOF DIET HELP ME LOSE WEIGHT?

Yes, being Bulletproof is a way to lose weight. It transforms the body into a lean, efficient, energetic machine. But that's really only a side effect of getting your body to operate in its most efficient state. Did I want to lose weight? Hell, yes. Is that why most people try the Bulletproof Diet in the first place? Absolutely. But is that what we're really doing here? No. Becoming our best, most powerful selves means fine-tuning every system in the body, from metabolism to detoxification to brain power. And when we do that, we lose excess weight because our systems are acting as they should. They are working at max capacity while burning energy efficiently and consistently. In essence, weight loss is a byproduct of making the body function optimally. I won't lie--it's the byproduct that most of us care the most about. But a thousand other good things are happening that make the weight loss possible. That's why becoming Bulletproof creates a noticeable upswing in brain function and energy levels. That's why people report feeling amazing--the best in their lives--when eating this way. So yes, weight loss is an awesome thing. But it's not the only thing. And it's not the thing that defines Bulletproof living. Bulletproof is much more concerned with holistic success, measured by performance across a number of bodily and brain functions.

HOW DOES THE BULLETPROOF DIET WORK?

The Bulletproof Diet doesn't work like most diets--there's no calorie counting because when you stop eating foods that make you weak, you'll actually be able to hear the hormone hunger signal from your body, and you won't experience food cravings. You don't have to attempt to magically work out more than you eat, which creates unsustainable biological stress for most people. And let's remember, famines and labor camps are not great ways to build willpower or resilience. Instead, choose foods that have the right kind of energy, but are also lowest in the things that slow you down, and highest in nutrients. Then, you eat them at the time when they will do the most for your body and mind based on circadian biology. This is a far cry from most ""healthy"" diets, which focus on decreasing the amount of energy in your food while increasing the amount of nutrients and totally ignoring the effects of antinutrients.

The Bulletproof Diet partially falls into a category broadly known as ketogenic diets, though my plan has fewer ketones than a full-on ketogenic diet. (For you science geeks out there, it's a cyclical ketogenic diet with nutrient timing!)

You've probably heard of plans like the Atkins Diet and the Paleo Diet, which also fall under the ketogenic umbrella, but make no mistake: The Bulletproof Diet is different from those popular programs, for reasons I'll get to shortly. The thing that lumps these approaches into a single category is the way that weight loss is achieved, namely by a process called ketosis. Ketosis is a state wherein your body burns fat instead of carbs. When you think about it, this is a pretty simple proposition. Your body typically burns carbs, turning them into sugar for energy. But if your body is out of carbs, it will go to Plan B: fat burning. It's a natural function, and one that your body would employ in a natural way depending on your circumstances. If you found yourself in a situation where you were deprived of carbs, your body would know what to do, and would find an alternate energy source (read: your stored fat). The Bulletproof Diet is built around creating a ketogenic state in order to burn fat stores for energy rather than using carbs. When you carb-load, you're stockpiling your body with extra energy to use, but in the absence of those carbs, your body will burn fat, so you become leaner in the process.

IS KETOSIS SAFE?

When I was initially discovering the power of ketosis for myself, I'd heard about the so-called Eskimo diet, where almost no calories come from carbohydrates, and most calories come from fat. Nutritional alarmists will often confuse a state of metabolic ketoacidosis from diabetes with the completely natural form of ketosis from diet--it's a natural state in which the body rests. Full ketosis is used to treat epilepsy and cancer, even in kids, with great safety. In this state, your body creates carbs from proteins. For some people, this is optimal and they stay in this state for prolonged periods. For other people, like me, it makes me feel run down. This is why, for ultimate resilience--and especially for women--I recommend cycling in and out of ketosis. I recommend eating some carbs as it stresses the body to create carbs from protein. With my recommendation, you get the best of both worlds. And my recommendation is still less suggestive of a ketogenic state than most paleo diets recommend.

When I began studying ketosis, I wanted to see what would happen if I entered a ketogenic state and stuck with it indefinitely--or for three months, as was the case for me. Guess what? It wasn't good. The Inuit people subsist primarily on protein and a huge amount of fat. They live on delicacies like whale blubber and seal jerky. And good for them; they are genetically predisposed to function this way as they've evolved with this diet for centuries . . . and they live on packed snow. We, in everyday America, however, have not. After eating nothing but protein and ridiculous amounts of fats for three months, my body started malfunctioning. My sleep quality went away. My eyes and sinuses were superdry all the time. I started getting headaches. Because I didn't have enough carbohydrates to manufacture the mucus that lines a healthy stomach, I developed food allergies to my favorite foods as soon as I added them back in. I'm still working to hack the food allergies I developed by eating that way, and making great progress. Clearly for me, this state of prolonged ketosis was a terrible idea. I know that having experienced it firsthand, and I've seen lesser versions of these symptoms--especially sleep and energy problems--in a good number of Bulletproof followers who stay in ketosis for long periods, though not all of them. This is why the Bulletproof approach advocates moving in and out of a ketogenic state, always being mindful of how and when we eat carbs for added energy. For the vast majority of people, I do not advocate putting your body in a ketogenic state indefinitely.

What I do know is that you can use ketosis as a tool, in measured, regular bursts, to bring out some amazing fat-burning and brain-revving potential. That is what being Bulletproof is all about: biohacking your way to the sweet spot where your system thrives and continually outperforms itself without causing damage or detriment to your systems.

SO HOW IS THE BULLETPROOF DIET DIFFERENT FROM THE ATKINS AND PALEO PLANS?

The Bulletproof Diet recommends 6 to 11 servings of veggies a day. ""Whoa"" you're thinking. ""That's a ridiculous amount of veggies."" And you're right. Some people have a hard time adjusting to eating this many servings of veggies because it so far exceeds what we've become accustomed to in the sad state of an American diet devoid of nutrition. I'm advocating more veggies per day than most other programs, and even some vegan diets! The FDA recommends 5 servings of 1/2 cup (or 21/2 cups per day). But please note, they treat fruits and veggies as the same thing. This is a flawed approach, because fruit is mostly sugar, while vegetables are mostly nutrients and fiber. I recommend 9 servings of veggies a day and potentially a lot more. So my plan suggests at least three times more than the FDA recommends. That's important to remember, because while we're asking you to skip carbs, in measured cycles, we're also flooding your body with the amazing nutrients nature provides, and teaching you how to identify and limit carb-heavy, starchy vegetables, except when you want your body to have healthy carbohydrates. So that's the first way Bulletproof living is different from the Atkins plan.

Atkins and Paleo are both considered ""low-carb high-fat"" (LCHF) diets. Atkins focuses on a high-protein, high-fat eating plan to trigger ketosis, but doesn't focus on the type of fat or protein. Paleo also advocates a high-protein, high-fat diet, but it does pay attention to the type of fat and protein, which is a major improvement. But it's also high enough in protein to trigger inflammation, and the impact of cooking techniques isn't a part of the diet, even though it affects how you use your food.

The Bulletproof Diet is also an LCHF diet, like Paleo and Atkins, but it has components that set it apart entirely: namely, a focus on eliminating cravings by controlling food toxins, and eating the right foods at the right times, not to mention significant differences in Bulletproof cooking methods. People forget that cooking is a form of food processing, and you can ""process"" food in your own kitchen and accidentally turn it from something nutritious into something that will make you crave sugar. This should be a no-brainer, but plenty of other diets don't really take this aspect of the formula into consideration.

Other plans know that by introducing ketosis, the body will burn fat, and so they figure, mission accomplished. But if you're burning fat that's full of food toxins, you're going to experience fatigue and cravings . . . totally not Bulletproof!

The Bulletproof Diet also differs from the Atkins and Paleo diets in its attention to toxins, or antinutrients. As I was hacking my own performance, and losing 100 £ds, I learned a lot about the toxins that exist, naturally and unnaturally, in our food supply. Besides of all the manmade toxins that have entered our food chain via pesticides and manufacturing processes, there are also naturally occurring antinutrients that, while they won't kill us, can slow down or compromise our natural system functions. Take kale, for example. The darling of healthy eaters everywhere, kale is enjoying its moment in the sun. It's all the rage in salads, juices, pastas, you name it. Every hip restaurant has kale somewhere on its menu, and most markets now offer an array of heirloom varieties. Here's the thing. Kale isn't always good for all of us. It's a goitrogenic food, which means that in its raw form it interferes with iodine uptake and can cause enlargement of the thyroid (this is where the term goiter comes from). It can slow your thyroid function, which is a bad thing because your thyroid controls your energy levels.

With menus for the four seasons, she shares the ways her family prepared and enjoyed food, savoring the delights of each special time of year:

• The fresh taste of spring—the first shad, wild mushrooms, garden strawberries, field greens and salads . . . honey from woodland bees . . . a ring mold of chicken with wild mushroom sauce . . . the treat of braised mutton after sheepshearing.

• The feasts of summer—garden-ripe vegetables and fruits relished at the peak of flavor . . . pan-fried chicken, sage-flavored pork tenderloin, spicy baked tomatoes, corn pudding, fresh blackberry cobbler, and more, for hungry neighbors on Wheat-Threshing Day . . . Sunday Revival, the event of the year, when Edna’s mother would pack up as many as fifteen dishes (what with her pickles and breads and pies) to be spread out on linen-covered picnic tables under the church’s shady oaks . . . hot afternoons cooled with a bowl of crushed peaches or hand-cranked custard ice cream.

• The harvest of fall—a fine dinner of baked country ham, roasted newly dug sweet potatoes, and warm apple pie after a day of corn-shucking . . . the hunting season, with the deliciously “different” taste of game fattened on hickory nuts and persimmons . . . hog-butchering time and the making of sausages and liver pudding . . . and Emancipation Day with its rich and generous thanksgiving dinner.

• The hearty fare of winter—holiday time, the sideboard laden with all the special foods of Christmas for company dropping by . . . the cold months warmed by stews, soups, and baked beans cooked in a hearth oven to be eaten with hot crusty bread before the fire.

The scores of recipes for these marvelous dishes are set down in loving detail. We come to understand the values that formed the remarkable woman—her love of nature, the pleasure of living with the seasons, the sense of community, the satisfactory feeling that hard work was always rewarded by her mother’s good food. Having made us yearn for all the good meals she describes in her memories of a lost time in America, Edna Lewis shows us precisely how to recover, in our own country or city or suburban kitchens, the taste of the fresh, good, natural country cooking that was so happy a part of her girlhood in Freetown, Virginia.",14731,"From the Inside Flap

News, comes a lasting weight-loss program based on the Mediterranean diet of her childhood that will encourage women to think “smarter, simpler, healthier”—a personal mantra that helped the star lose (and keep off!) forty pounds.
 
TV host and journalist Maria Menounos was once more than forty pounds overweight, low on energy, and often sick. Desperate for a change, she tried a wide array of diet and exercise fads—with zero success. Like most EveryGirl out there, Maria lacked the time, money, energy, and willpower to get in shape.
 
Determined to overcome those obstacles, Maria spent a year developing commonsense diet, exercise, and lifestyle techniques that transcended traditional nutrition and weight-loss plans.

One of the foremost voices in food activism and justice, Bryant Terry brings soul food back to its roots with plant-based, farm-to-table, real food recipes that leave out heavy salt and refined sugar, ""bad"" fats, and unhealthy cooking techniques, and leave in the down-home flavor. Vegan Soul Kitchen recipes use fresh, whole, healthy ingredients and cooking methods with a focus on local, seasonal, sustainably raised food. Bryant developed these vegan recipes through the prism of the African Diaspora-cutting, pasting, reworking, and remixing African, Caribbean, African-American, Native American, and European staples, cooking techniques, and distinctive dishes to create something familiar, comforting, and deliciously unique. Reinterpreting popular dishes from African and Caribbean countries as well as his favorite childhood dishes, Named one of the best vegetarian/vegan cookbooks of the last 25 years by Cooking Light Magazine, Vegan Soul Kitchen reinvents African-American and Southern cuisine--capitalizing on the complex flavors of the tradition, without the animal products.

Starred Review. In this electric, eclectic collection of vegan soul food, West Coast chef Bryant Terry (Grub: Ideas for an Urban Organic Kitchen) manages not only to demystify classic southern cooking, he makes it healthier and more accessible. With a low-key approach, commonly sourced ingredients and recipes worthy of any palette, Terry avoids the didacticism and rigidity of other vegan cookbooks. An impressive amount of information for each recipe, including entertainment recommendations, is also provided. Many dishes will make the list of to-trys: a riff on the traditional Gumbo Z'Herbs that's traditionally eaten during Lent; a roasted potato salad with a parsley-pine nut pesto; and the ubiquitous chow-chow, a vinegar-laced relish that's indispensable with greens. Terry's simplicity is also commendable: a side of wilted swiss chard and spinach with lemon-tahini dressing is a healthier, creamier alternative to Caesar salad, and his Simple Seared Green Beans are a terrific way to enjoy the vegetable at its peak; classic treats like peach cobbler and mint juleps are also included. Though something of a Pyrrhic victory-a terrific and tasty collection of healthy Southern variations unfortunately relegated to the ""vegan"" ghetto-Terry's latest will make a happy discovery for cooks of any dietary persuasions.

Review
Alice Waters
“Bryant Terry knows that good food should be an everyday right and not a privilege. This book is full of easy, tasty, seasonal recipes that also happen to be vegan and affordable!”
John Robbins, author The Food Revolution and Diet for a New America
“Do you think a commitment to healthy eating means enduring bland and boring food? Vegan Soul Kitchen will not only show you otherwise, but will make it easy for you to create fabulously delicious and exotic dishes. Here’s proof that natural foods can be fascinating and sensuous. Here are recipes you will enjoy using time and again.”
Heidi Swanson, author of Super Natural Cooking, publisher of 101Cookbooks.com
“From gumbo to grits, goobers to greens, Vegan Soul Kitchen dispels the notion that great tasting soul food has to be bad for you. This is a beautiful book brimming with nutrient-packed, approachable everyday recipes. One of those rare cookbooks I look forward to cooking through from cover to cover.”
Van Jones, author of the New York Times bestseller The Green Collar Economy
“Much more than a cookbook, Vegan Soul Kitchen reads like a rich gumbo of the African American experience, a history lesson with a mouthwatering twist. From reaching back to our heritage as stewards of the earth to offering modern recipes, music suggestions and original poetry, Bryant brings together a portrait of a people as well as a movement (food justice) that is poised to save our health, green our communities, and sustain the earth. Bryant knows the shortest way to people’s hearts is through their stomachs.”
