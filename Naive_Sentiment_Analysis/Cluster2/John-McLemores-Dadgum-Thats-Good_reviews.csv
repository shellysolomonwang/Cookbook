1,"John McLemore's ""Dadgum That's Good!""",5,Glad I bought this book,Format: Paperback,"I tend to read reviews from the worst to the best. One of the worst was upset with the 'religious' intonations. Others were disappointed that their particular cooker was not covered to their satisfaction.

From there I read the book. I love John's dedication to family; his young entrepreneurial spirit.

As a Jew, many of his recipes don't fit my religious dietary laws, but I can also make many work. ""Dadgum..."" also helps me understand the smoker I bought 10 years ago- not John's product. I look forward to using his recipes on my own old smoker.

There is more to buying a recipe book than making the recipes. John shared his family with us. I cook Chinese food also and have become close to the author of several excellent books on the subject. Her first may well be her best. It was written from her 'heart.' Reading John's book gives me the same feeling of 'family'-- of 'heart.'",4 people found this helpful,1

I was pleasently surprised to find the wide range of recipies in here. It has a nice selection for the smoker, meats AND side dishes (I never would have guessed you could smoke potato salad and mac and cheese) and also a section for steaming, grilling and frying. We have tried about 7 things out of this book from sides to smoked meats to grilled items and all tasted wonderful. The photos are nice and big and if you follow the directions your food will come out looking as pictured. If you buy this keep in mind its a cook book that is not only for smoking but for cooking in general.",,1

Amazon should update this book page to more clearly state that this book requires certain machines to use.

Even the boiling recipes are written with directions to be prepared in a turkey frying machine! Boiling on the stove works just fine for me and pretty much the rest of the people in this world.
