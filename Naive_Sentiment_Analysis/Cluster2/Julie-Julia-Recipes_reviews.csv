I even went as far as attempting one of the recipes, only to learn that trying to cook like Julie or Julia was a little too ambitious for my skill set. It was fun though, like this book. Julie made me laugh with her frustrations and mistakes. The lobster scene alone makes it worth reading the whole book. As Julie became more aware of her own shortcomings I became more able to laugh at my own in comparison. She also gives a glance into the love story that was Julia and Paul's life together. This is part of Julia's life we don't often hear about. You fall in love with the Julia Child you never knew, or maybe you did if you read "" My Life in France"" as I was compelled to do when I finished this book. I feel Julie Powell's feat of cooking her way through ""MTAOFC"" was comedic enough to make an enjoyable book, and Julia Childs' whole life was interesting enough to be the icing on the cake of that book.",4 people found this helpful,1

Setting aside one year to accomplish this feat, Julie bravely begins with page one and works her way through all 524 recipes. It's a wonder she and her husband didn't die from high cholesterol eating all this rich food

An amusing account of what started so light-heartedly and came to be a way of coping with a dead-end job, the trauma of living in New York during 9/11, and trying to cook in a tiny kitchen which was never designed for this.

9,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",4,"Not what you'd expect, but an excellent book despite itself",Format: Mass Market Paperback,"I am giving this book a 4-star review, but I must explain why in detail because I understand some of the vicious reviews others have given it.

First, by now, most of us buying this book will have already seen the movie, and, as others have noted, the real Julie Powell is not at all like Amy Adams. In the movie, Amy is adorable, cute, and attractive, an ideal protaganist to root for. Julie Powell, as she presents herself in this book, is not only a bitch, but a whining, self-pitying, narcississtic bitch--an almost thoroughly unlikable character.

Second, as we all know, editors have gone the way of linotype machines--I guess they started disappearing 20 or 30 years ago, and by now, the folks with that title seem to be little more than project managers whose only focus is managing deadlines and maybe expenses. The prose in the beginning of the book is really hard to take; reading it made me as uncomfortable as watching an untalented child screeching for attention from a stage. It seemed as though half the sentences had an extra third tacked on where Julie was trying to prove she was an 'author' who could really 'write'. An editor working on a college newspaper could have vastly improved the book with a red pencil and some strong guidance.

Third, this is based on a blog. This means there is only one subject: the attention-starved author whose exhibitionism creates a completely unwarranted sense of self-importance in the author's own mind and heart. The book is not about cooking, not about learning, not even about working through Julia Child's classic cookbook, it is about Julie, and nothing but Julie. I can completely understand why Julia might not have liked the blog: what I wanted to see was, 'Here's what I am going to cook next, here are my adventures and misadventures encountered along the way, here is how it tasted, here is what I learned about cooking and about myself.' That is most emphatically not what this book is about. Julie was given the nickname Sarah Bernhardt from a very young age because she has evidently been given to histrionics and tantrums since birth--that's pretty much what the book is about.

Having now confirmed most of the negative appraisals given by those reviewers who only gave this book 1 or 2 stars and probably wished they could have given it zero, how do I get from here to a 4 star review? Let me try to explain.

This is, quite inadvertantly, a very adult book. Granted, the language is that of a foul-mouthed teenager, the attitude that of a petulant child, the insights, well, there really aren't any. I would not recommend this book to any under 25, maybe even under 30. Imagine a memoir written by a substance-abusing street person who once worked on Wall Street. This is how grim this book is.

Julie Powell is not a drunk, or a drug addict; she is a reasonably sane, functioning adult, but she is deeply damaged, still trapped in some childhood drama that we, even now, know nothing about because she lacks the insight to see it for herself yet.

But, even though I did have to skip a few pages towards the beginning of the book that were just unbearable, the book became more compelling as I forged ahead for two critical reasons:

1) Julie actually learned to write as she was writing this book. A decent editor would have pointed this out and cleaned up the amateurish, exhibitionist beginning to match the more maturely written last half of the book, but, alas, Julie was ill-served by a project manager. Offhand, I would say the most egregiously bad writing is confined to the first 30-50 pages or so, and seems to disappear almost entirely after page 80.

2) The growth I was hoping to see Julie undergo during the project only really began to happen afterwards, while she was writing this book. But she did grow as she wrote the book, although in ways she is apparently yet unable to see. The book is funny, and episodic, and meant to be a number of things, but it is mostly grim and compelling. It's like watching an addict invent rehab on their own without ever even realizing it. When Julie says she was drowing and Julia saved her, she's telling the truth. She was lost in a crappy life, but the only thing that really made her life crappy was her, not her husband, family, friends, job, apartment, or city. All of the crappiness was entirely inside Julie, entirely of her own making, and it was only through committing herself to this journey that she was able to begin to drag herself out of her narcisstic black hole of misery.

Nora Ephron based her movie on two books that she essentially threw away in order to make up a beautiful dual story of personal growth. I am so glad she invented the character that Amy Adams realized so well. This book, on the other hand, tells the very adult tale of an immature, un-self-aware, miserable narcissist who began to work her way out of this nightmare of her own making by discovering the joy of learning that Julia so fully embodied. When she writes of this at the end of the book, she is still embarrassed to use the word 'joy', and this alone should give you an indication of how deeply damaged she really is. But, as you get further and further into the book, you begin to see the redemptive power of committment to a project outside of one's own neurotic orbit, a redemption that begins to work its magic even though Julie is too miserable and flawed to see anything more than glimpses of it herself.

The movie is cute, and funny, and wonderful, and light. This book is a grim memoir of redemption that is made all the more powerful by the fact that the author is too unperceptive to see what is going on herself. There is a turning point in the book, but it's hard to find because Julie never saw it herself, so she didn't structure the narrative around it. The book is life-affirming and ultimately very positive because it shows that the right mission, diligently followed, can save us despite our attempts to sabotage it.",14 people found this helpful,1

13,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",4,For the Reader Who Enjoys Profanity...,Format: Mass Market Paperback,"Have I got the book for you! As a reader who sprinkles my own conversation with cursing, I had no issues with Julie Powell's filthy mouth (and she's got a mouth like a sailor). I wouldn't read this book to my grandmother, and I'd say it isn't for anyone who has an issue with cursing. A lot of cursing.

Julie Powell's life is not what she was expecting. She's worried about getting pregnant, stuck in a dead-end job, and living in a tiny crappy apartment that is not where she wants it to be. And as many people do, she decides to do something that will resolve none of those issues but will allow her to focus on something else. She decides to go through the 524 recipes in Julia Child's The Art of French Cooking in one year.

It's an experiment that does not go smoothly. She burns stuff, has to figure out how to open up a bone to get marrow, and uses so much butter that none of her clothing fits. It in no way convinced me that attempting this experiment would be at all entertaining. It is however, entertaining to read about someone else doing it.

At times, Julie Powell comes off as whiny and self-absorbed. She's got a filthy mouth, and she's not afraid to use it. There was more than one instance in the book where I wanted to smack her for the way that she acts about her husband, who seems like a perfectly nice guy married to someone who who doesn't appreciate him. With all that in mind, I enjoyed the book. It's not the best thing I read this year, but it's a decent food memoir from someone who loved Julia Child.",2 people found this helpful,1

21,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",4,"For those who hate their jobs, and love to cook",Format: Hardcover,"The premise of this book is quite interesting - a woman who is looking for direction in her life stumbles across her mother's old, hardback...(is that important..??) copy of Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"", and has an epiphany. She decides, that in one year, she will cook all 524 recipes in the book, and write about her experiences in a blog - still a relatively new ""art"" form at that time.

The resulting blog, and book, are filled with lustily-written passages describing cooking; her rather surreal job at an unnamed government job; (Something to do with designing a new memorial building at the Twin Towers Site post 9/11); her interesting, albiet flakey - no, that isnt' the word - maybe ""bohemian"" is better - friends; and her marriage. Her writing is full of angst, passion, and (dare I say it??) verve. All-in-all, a highly entertaining read.

The recipes, as such, are limited. This is not a cookbook. This is a memoir of cooking. This is a memoir of life. This is a memoir of joie-de-vivre. This is a book that has more to do with discovering that while you can hate your job, your coworkers and where your life is going, you can love to cook, love your husband, love your friends, and that, in the end, is what matters.

It's a personal memoir that happens to revolve around a young woman's quest to replicate all of the recipes in a very famous (and difficult) French cookbook.

If you liked ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" and other books of that type, you will absolutely devour (ha) ""Julie and Julia"". Julie Powell is whiny - yes. She is self-absorbed - yep. She can be a bit of a jerk - absolutely. But she is also real and hysterically funny. If the haters who gave this book a bad review didn't catch the self-deprecation in her language....I don't know what to say. I thought her tone was crystal clear, presenting herself honestly in all her imperfect glory. One reviewer complained that she's mean to her husband. I mean, geez...raise your hand and give yourself a halo if you've never snapped at your spouse. There were complaints about the profanity: really??? A light smattering of f-bombs equals extreme obscenity? Who knew?

Like I said above, do not expect this to be a cookbook in any form. You will not learn to cook a thing - not even boil water - from this book. You will, however, be highly entertained by Julie's antics and fits - her struggles with aspic in particular, as she transforms from a girl who won't eat anything (EVER!) to slurping down poached eggs in beef jelly. You will also laugh out loud at her descriptions of friends and family. Powell has a gift for language and a refreshing honesty that makes this book a winner.",One person found this helpful,1

I have to admit that few things make me more suspicious than a book that derived from a blog. I also have a pretty low tolerance for chick lit in general, and this smelled like chick lit to me.

But anyhow. Despite going into the book with poor expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. I found it well-written and it felt honest. It had several laugh-out-loud moments. Best of all, I found myself genuinely liking the narrator/author. It was good fun. And that was exactly what I wanted it to be.

Although you can get some foodie kicks from Julie & Julia, it is not really about food. Do not read the book if you are looking for technical details, deep reflection about Julia Childs and French cooking, or kitchen tips and tricks. It is not that kind of book. Think light read with cooking as a kind of character quest.

One quarrel-- in her author's note Powell declares that ""sometimes she just makes stuff up"". That made me less comfortable with the book, honestly. As a memoir it has a lot of charm. As a novel, it has much less interest. I am not sure why that should be the case, but it took a little bit of the shine off for me to see that note at the beginning.

Anyhow. If, like me, you are looking for some cheering up then this could be a book for you. Bonus points if you find yourself an urbanite with a foodie-wannabee cooking habit, because then the funny parts are going to be even funnier. I had to wince when remembering some of my own attempts at homemade mayonnaise. Recommended.",194 people found this helpful,1

In contrast to that, I almost NEVER want anything to do with Mastering The Art of French Cooking. Her battered cookbook seems to be a character in the story with its own personality. Kudos to her for pulling off the project but it sounds exhausting, daunting, outdated yet terrifying.
It took me a long time to read this book, but only because I enjoyed savoring it.
The pain and exasperation, the conversational tone seems a bit rambling at times. The imagined scenes of Paul and Julia were less interesting to me than reading about the life of Eric and Julie.

88,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",4,From misery to joy - what the book is about,Format: Hardcover,"Yes, I saw the movie first, which is the way I prefer to do things. Books are so rich, and movies so flat; it's so seldom that the movie enriches the book. So don't expect the book to be like the movie or you will be disappointed. Julie Powell, the writer, is no Amy Adams.

The book is about a young woman's journey out of fourth-world hell, and as the memoir of that journey it succeeds wildly. So it is not a cook and tell book, and probably shouldn't even appear in the cookbook aisle. While Julie may have learned to cook along the way, the depth and richness of the writing is about life with all its warts, whines and swear words. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want to eat a meal prepared in Julie's kitchen, but I'll gladly pick up another book that comes off her iMac.

Julie shares, in detail, the stresses of her marriage and her family and her fears about her biological clock and her friends' life choices along with the flaws and failures of her attempts at various types of cooking. Julie's day-to-day life is punctuated with fictional memoirs from the point of view of Julia Child's husband, and reveals to us who Julia Child was before she picked up a whisk. Julia's life, romanticized, where Julie's is not.

89,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",5,Funny and inspiring,Format: Hardcover,".Just thinking of the author, Julie Powell's journey into Julia Child's world leaves me exhausted, fascinated and in awe of her husband's tolerance and patience. I found myself laughing out loud at her misadventures in the kitchen, and even her constant use of the word f xxx. I scold anyone who uses the word, and yet Ms Powell's writing style pulled me in, realizing it was the only way she expressed her emotions. It added to, rather than taking from, the elements of good writing.
Using her blogging experiences also added a fun dimension to her memoir, which is more like a confessional. She hates her day job, loves her offbeat friends and describes catastrophic attempts at French cooking as if she is sitting in my living room discussing the same. I was able to imagine Julia Child being a crude, honest and full of just-do-it courage as Julie was in her memoir, including the profanity laced throughout. Eric, the author's husband, reminded me of Paul, Ms. Child's husband, in his acceptance of the hilarious attempt of the wife learning the art of French cooking. Neither could cook, and yet, over time, both became media darlings from their culinary talents.
As I cook for my husband I'll smile as I remember so many parts of this book, making the monotonous daily meal a more meaningful and at times an amusing adventure.

These books generally give a glimpse into the person's life in the midst of their project, but aren't so entirely self-absorbed.

Julie Powell is frustrated with her dead-end job and the death of her dreams to do something more, so she decides to cook through Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking in one year. This book is adapted from her blog (back when blogs were relatively new) that she kept detailing her projects one recipe at a time.

I enjoyed this book a lot. The intricacies of foods that I will never cook or eat (aspic and veal marrow) was fascinating and her telling is funny (many project memoirs, are funny and that's another reason I like them).

95,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",4,"Not What I Expected...Better and Worse, Honest and Raw Memoir",Format: Hardcover,"In anticipation of the movie by the same name and by a serendipitous sale while on a trip to a local bookseller I ended up with a copy of this entertaining memoir. I had not heard of The Project before seeing the film trailer. And once I saw the film trailer I was completely in love with the idea and the intersecting stories of the two women on separate but intertwined journeys. Buying the book seemed like the absolute best idea. Before I continue, though, I need to toss out some caution flags. Caution number one...based on the subject matter and charming cover you'd never guess this book would be full sexuality. It is. I'm guessing if you tossed a few seasons of Sex in the City into a crock-pot, added several chapters of Mastering the Art of French Cooking and folded in a few trade chick-lits, a tablespoon of assorted spices, and a few cups of wine you'd end up with a dish of Julie and Julia en croute.

In example, regarding Caution One, two friends actively engaged or toying with adultery, a friend with erotic dreams and lack of filter, a heroine who seems at the edge of her very sanity several times, raw, naked, food, mastering and manipulating and enjoying said food, a move, a despised job not to mention a syndrome and a biological clock clanging on the cusp of a thirtieth birthday, well, all lend themselves to frequent F-bombs and much sexual conversation and shared thoughts.

Caution Number Two. I expected more Julia. Julia isn't absent but a bit anemic and in a ratio of about 10% Julia, 90% Julie. Julie's life is definitely one that kept me turning pages, sometimes with apprehension, but turning nonetheless. But if you are seeking half and half or heavy on the Julia you might be disappointed.

Julie is clever and writes some terrific sentences. Some of her descriptions are deliciously hysterical. One little tidbit about her poor, sweet husband as a butter mule brought tears to my eyes. Also, Julie gets a little or a lot political and is definitely not a fan of religion and/or God depending on the rants I encountered. Anger, though amusing much of the time, still comes across as anger and added a bitter aftertaste. I loved Eric and the fact that though there were times I wondered if their marriage would survive the slinging, the cursing, the thoughts, in the light of day Julie always managed to find the good and the right in her marriage and attempted to speak positively about her husband, painting him as an unconventional hero.

Sarcasm lovers. Those who like underdog stories wherein beaten down and depressed person picks self up by boot straps and through some quirky, self-imposed lifestyle choice ends up changing need to look further into Julie and Julia. The unfolding story is a painful process to watch. But there is something grandly delicious about the final multicourse meal on the cosmic table of a hard won success. Though a thick fuzzy blanket of dust lies beneath the dining room table covering and spiderwebs bind the candle sconces to the wall and each other, though the sink gurgles in protest and the pans cover all available space in the kitchen, the meal ends up being very much like life. Delicious and decadent mixed with sparse and stringy, washed down with joy and tears, and shared with people just as stinking messy.",5 people found this helpful,1

On the record, I was disappointed that this subtitle was taken out of the paperback edition which I wouldn't have read without the subtitle, but since it was there and I did read it, I can tell you what I think.)

Julie Powell is a woman after my heart. Like me, she was a government drone, thankfully - only temporarily for both of us. She also let herself get sucked into the swirling vortex of a goal that took over her life and drastically impacted the lives of many of the people around her.

This was another part of the appeal. How do we know when we say ""Yes"" to a zany, seemingly unreachable goal and then begin to march to the drum beat ""it"" sets? We don't - but we do know, as we are reminded anew from the story of Julie Powell and her menagerie of friends and family members - that this is the ""journey"" we hear about when it is said, ""It isn't the destination, it is the journey.""

Our journey through iconic cook books and iconic cook book authors vis a vis a quirky blog-writer. On page 76, Julie writes about her work to get beef marrow into a recipe which tasted, she writes, ""like life, well lived.""

The universality in that one sentence took me by the heart and said, ""Keep reading. Oh, and cook some new recipes, would you? You haven't found one yet that tastes like life, well lived.""

Through the book I came to really want the project to be completed and got sort of angry at a point when I thought it was going to be ditched about two months from the end-line. I got so worried, I skipped immediately to the end to see what happened.

Well, I won't spoil it for you here - but I will tell you to read this unique memoir of not just cooking up food, but a memoir of a life that cooks. I hope to find more works by Julie Powell because I find myself still rooting for her.

97,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",4,A mix of 5-stars and 3-stars: witty but a little too whiny,Format: Hardcover,"I'd been intending to read this book for a couple of years. After all, I'm an active blogger and a serious foodie (as the number of my cookbook reviews will demonstrate). But I procrastinated until I saw the movie preview (in which Meryl Streep captures Julia Child *amazingly*). Now that I read the book... I have oddly mixed feelings.

The real life story is simple enough: a young woman from New York City, stuck in a going-nowhere office job, decides to cook every single recipe from Julia Child's Mastering The Art of French Cooking, a cookbook that was probably on your mother's bookshelf, if not your own. (My mother didn't own a copy, but then Mom hated to cook; the Settlement Cookbook was more her speed. Or a stovetop dinner whose instructions began, ""Just brown a pound of ground beef...."")

Anyway, Julie Powell blogged about her experiences, which gathered an avid following. This is the book version of the blog. Happily for the reader, this blog-to-book transition did not try to follow the ""just print the blog"" diary style used in, say, Waiter Rant. So it's eminently readable even if you've never looked at a web log in your life.

If you'd asked me to rate this book halfway through, I'd probably have given it 5 stars. Julie is witty, and she draws you into her life -- not just into her kitchen. Maybe I didn't need to know about her medical conditions or her worries about turning 30 without getting pregnant, but it was okay. Because the beef marrowbone story, for example, put all the backstory into context and made me laugh aloud. (""Perhaps in 1961, when JC published MtAoFC, marrowbones hung off trees like greasy Christmas ornaments. But I did not live in 1961, nor did I live in France, which would have made things simpler. Instead, I lived in Long Island City, and in Long Island City, marrowbones are simply not to be had."")

But perhaps Julie & Julia affected me like too much cream and butter in my food -- after a while, it was too much for one sitting. For one thing, there was less examination of the cooking experience (with a few good exceptions, such as killing lobsters) and a little too much about Julie's life and friends. It's a little like a singer whose voice you like, but who has a ""sound"" that is a bit too much to listen to for an entire album. Instead of being charmed by Julie's observations, I began to feel as though she was whining about her sex life, her apartment's plumbing, the love lives of the people around her -- and that threatened to chase me away. She's a good writer, really she is, so I kept going until the end... but by then, I found it almost depressing. I love to cook, too, but all that matters in your life is meeting a self-imposed arbitrary deadline?

End result: I liked this book. I'm glad I read it. But I don't feel as though you MUST read it, and I will not press it upon you. If the movie lives up to the trailers, that might be enough.",2 people found this helpful,1

I got to read a same of the first chapter of the book on my kindle and fell in love with this book! I bought the entire kindle version and could not put it down. What most people would see as ""whinny"" is really heavy sarcasm and must not be taken seriously. The author uses such rich vocabulary words and strings them together in such a way as to get one laughing so hard it is sure you make the reader gasping for air and clutching his or her belly.

This book is genuine and though she used foul language it is something I have come to expect out of a young persons mouth. She does not try to hide her real self. Julie Powell was 29 and trying to cope with life in New York. She came home one day with a bag of groceries, unknowingly with the exact ingredients for a recipe from Julia Child's recipe for potato and leek soup from her mother's copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking, which she stole! This book is a memoir of a young lady finding one way to cope with the depressing life after the events of 9/11. She is angry, is insecure with the government, and overall bored with her life. Her blog and experiments with Julia Child's recipes became her life! I myself enjoy trying new recipes and experimenting in my kitchen and find myself in a disaster not unlike some of the ones described in this book. I related well to this memoir. I too am in a situation where sometimes I need a change in routine and inspiration in my life. This book is inspiring to me and was just the thing I needed to get myself laughing and looking at cookbooks, or any challenge for that matter, in a whole new light. Thanks Julie!

Married and living in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, working as a secretary in an unnamed government agency after a series of dead end jobs, pushing thirty, and having learned that she may have fertility problems, Julie Powell is ready for a change. Inspired by her parents' copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking by Julia Child (MtAoFC), Julie creates a blog and declares her challenge to the universe:

""Government drone by day, renegade foodie by night. Too old for theater, too young for children, and too bitter for anything else, Julie Powell was looking for a challenge. And in the Julie/Julia Project she found it. Risking her marriage, her job, and her cats well-being, she has signed on for a deranged assignment. 365 days. 524 recipes. One girl and a crappy outer borough kitchen. How far will it go, no one can say ....""

Sure enough, the book takes us through the challenges and victories of that year. The culinary ones have an undercurrent of NYC scavenger hunt and discovery, like Julie's first experience with bone marrow: Bifteck Saute Bercy garnished with bone marrow of a cow. The personal challenges and the torments of her low rent apartment meld with the Julie/Julia Project making frozen pipes, water outages, blackouts, and the move to Long Island City, Queens part of a large, mildly hysterical adventure.

Review:
With all the advertisements for the movie coming out and the buzz about this book, you probably know about the Julie/Julia Project and have some impression of the book. Before I began reading, I wondered whether Julie Powell would pull it off. It sounded like a good idea, but would it end up slow or contrived? Annoying? I'm glad to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I wish I'd known more about Julia Child as I read the about the birth of the Julie/Julia Project. My vague recollections of Julia Child meant that this book shaped much of my image of Julia. But this is really isn't a bad thing. Julie's Julia is a funny, practical, generous and adventuresome muse. I've just unearthed and watched a video of the Omelette Show on The French Chef and will surely watch more Julia Child over time.

100,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",4,The tale of a blogger,Format: Mass Market Paperback,"Julia Child was and always will be an icon in the cooking world. I went to the American History Museum at the Smithsonian and saw the display with her kitchen. I just stood in awe to think of everything that had been cooked there. It was the same feeling that Julie Powell had after she had completed her year long project to cook every recipe in Julia Child's French cookbook and blog about it. I enjoyed reading about her decision and the reactions she got when Julie pursued the project. Challenges are always that, a challenge to do and especially when there's no real incentive, it can be hard to finish it. However she manages to do it, have fun in the meantime, and learn how to cook really good food. I, myself, probably would never accomplish this task, due to my distaste of most French food, but as a mild foodie it was fun to read. The little Julia excerpts throughout the book, while fictionalized, made her and her husband come alive in the book. I almost shrieked and grimaced throughout the maggot scene in the book. Even now, I'm still gagging just thinking about it. It was portrayed humorously but if I had been in Julie's shoes I would have been doing the exact same things she did.

There were a few things about this book that I wasn't too fond of. I would have liked more talk about the food. I assume that all that was left on the blog, but it would have been nice to have read some excerpts from the blog entries or more adventures about what happened. What was in the book was really fun to read and very enjoyable. It's just not a food memoir so if that's why you're reading the book, you should be prepared. While I fully appreciate her excitement about being a blogger (the comments, the readers, the hits), I have never in my 3 years of blogging have ever heard anyone call a blog reader a ""bleader"". There is some language in the book and while at times it's a bit grating, it's not a big distraction.

Overall I enjoyed the book and Julie's style of writing. It was fun reading into a year of her life and the background story behind the idea for her blog. I wish I could have read her blog during it's original run. I'll be looking forward to seeing the movie and watching the book come to life.",One person found this helpful,1

102,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",4,From a blog to a book...anything is possible!,Format: Hardcover,"In August of 2002, Julie is a twenty nine year old wife and secretary living in a tiny apartment in New York City and unhappy. She's searching for fulfillment and isn't finding it in her office job. She comes up with the idea for a project to cook all of the recipes in Julia Child' Mastering the Art of French Cooking in one year and write about her daily experiences in a blog. She isn't a chef but she likes to cook and her mother has a well worn copy of the cookbook that she borrows. Julie's husband and friends are supportive but her mother isn't too crazy about what Julie sets out to do.

What I liked about this book was that it was about a normal, everyday person who sets a goal for herself ,an experiment of sorts, and she blogs about it daily. This book is heartfelt and it is written based on the thoughts, experiences, frustrations and accomplishments that Julie goes through during this one year project that she writes about on her blog. Some people may be offended by her political comments and comments about 9/11 victims and families as she writes about working for a government agency that deals directly with this situation. Her comments are callous and insensitive at times but again, these are her thoughts and feelings written from her blog. She also swears.... a lot...the ""F"" word is used quite frequently. It didn't bother me that much but I can see that some readers may be offended. She talks about her body...how it is changing eating so much high fat foods...and her sex life and her friends sex lives. So be warned, if this kind of stuff bothers you...you may not want to read it.",One person found this helpful,1

Julie Powell was a 29YO New Yorker, married but childless, working for an undisclosed government agency after 9-11, and supposedly suffering from a ""syndrome"" that would turn her into a bloated and hairy beast in the near future. Educated, gifted, and stubborn, Julie takes it upon herself to work her way through all the recipes of Julia Childs' classic, Mastering the Art of French Cooking or MtAoFC as Julie calls it in her memoir. At her husband's suggestion, she starts a blog of her culinary adventures. Before she knows it, cooking her way through MtAoFC becomes THE focus of her life and she finds the meaning and purpose that eluded her.

We get far more than a cooking diary here. We meet Julie's family and friends and the romantic adventures of girlfriends in her age group; we learn about Julie's fears and intense dislikes (Republicans, mostly); we meet her typically annoying bureaucrat bosses and marginalized coworkers. The girl does not hold back; she cusses like the proverbial sailor and is not cowed by those who tell her that her language ""really adds nothing"" to the story. Who cares? This is hormonal, unadulterated Julie. Her trash mouth is just part of her charm. If harsh language offends, you might want to pass on this read.

What's wonderful about this book is seeing how one stubborn person with resolve can bring her life back from quiet desperation, or in Julie's case, mouthy desperation. It's refreshing to see that it's possible to do something about the emptiness of post-modern life, and it doesn't involve vast sums of money. It involves vast sums of butter and determination. Most of us won't be taking on any projects like Julie, but it's still a lot of fun to read about someone else doing it.

Many reviewers gave up on the story early because of language, etc. This is not a cooking book. Julie doesn't claim to be a gourmand and she says so a few times. This is more of a 30-something urban female memoir that happens to have cooking as a central element. Each chapter begins with creative nonfiction letters from Julia Child and her husband Paul when they were living in Paris in the 1940s. Julie is no gourmand now, but there's no telling what she'll become. After all, Julia Child didn't learn to cook until her late-30s.

I highly recommend Julie & Julia for a fun and inspiring read.",9 people found this helpful,1

This may be one of the few cases where I've read so many people insisting that the movie is better than the book. I've seen the movie and read the book, and can say that I liked them both...but for different reasons.

The movie is charming, whereas the book is witty. The real Julie Powell can be snarky at times; she can also be an extremely entertaining narrator. She smokes. She swears. And, not only is her husband a marginal character in her memoir, she admits to cheating on him (in her second book, ""Cleaving""). Fans of the movie aren't likely to put up with her antics...

...which is a shame, since the book is a riot. It's an uninhibited, winding mess that's as profane as the blog that inspired it.

Another note: Julia Child only makes it into this book in a series of 1-2 page vignettes--the subplot is nowhere near as developed as the movie, and can be quite difficult to follow if you're not familiar with Child's life already.

Someone comes up with a harebrained, or possibly a brilliant, idea, such as reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica (Know-It-All), watching a movie in a different theater every day for a year (A Year at the Movies), or eating nothing but fast food for one month (Super Size Me). What kind of obsessed people are these? Maybe I wouldn't take on these crazy projects myself, but I can't resist their stories.

Julie Powell doesn't seem obsessive at all, a little prone to mood swings perhaps, and depressed that her job as a temp secretary in Manhattan is so-o-o-o boring and that she is approaching age thirty before she is quite ready for it. Her husband Eric, whose even temper is the perfect counterpoint to Julie's emotional peaks and valleys, suggests that she a) go to cooking school, and b) visit her family in Austin. Julie sensibly takes his advice to get away for a while and rediscovers her mother's forty-year-old copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Why spend money for cooking school when Julia Child has already developed a course in her classic cookbook? An idea begins to form. . .

Eric, not only supportive, but also full of good ideas, further suggests that Julie keep a blog of her project, an original idea in 2002. The project has rules now: all the recipes must be completed within one year and she has to post on her blog every day.

When I heard about this book, I thought it would be a fun read about Julie's adventures and misadventures in French cooking. It turned out to be rather more than that. It would have been easy enough for Julie to just flesh out her blog a bit and turn it into a book. Instead, she weaves in partly true stories about her friends and family, partly true stories about Julia Child and her husband Paul, and snippets from Samuel Pepys's diaries. Since Julie's temp job is connected with the aftermath of September 11, that hangs in the background as well.",3 people found this helpful,1

Julie needed a ""project"" to motivate herself as she was not very happy working as a secretary for a government agency dealing with 9/11 victims. In addition to experimenting all the recipes, Julie decided to start her own blog, documenting her experience. It was encouraging to her when she started having readers who encouraged her to keep going when she was very frustruated with her cooking as well as just life in general.

It was quite fun to read about Julie's experience as sometimes, the food might turn out well and sometime it was quite disastrous. It was also interesting to read about her ordeal of getting weird incredients that were suggested by Julia Child. I think that people who have try experimenting with different recipes may be able to relate to Julie's experience. I am not sure why some reviewers here are upset that Julie did not provide any recipes as this is not a cookbook. This is about Julie and her quest to complete her ""project.""

I like the movie better--but of course, it includes more material on Julia Child's fascinating life. This is a good book, although Powell seems to take a thoughtless pride in using offensive language even when her bleaders (blog readers) wish she wouldn't. I'm not sure that she can actually claim to have made all the recipes in Mastering the Art of French Cooking, vol. 1, as she often substitutes ingredients and some efforts are disastrous, but the attempt makes for a good read and an even better basis for a movie that I recommend instead of this book. Certainly the constraints Powell experienced in her tiny kitchen and with a full-time job are obstacles, and I revolt at her descriptions of her cat-hair-covered, plumbing-challenged, poorly housekept apartment, but her supportive, almost-too-good-to-be-true husband, Eric, is a gem. I can see why Julia Child didn't like this book, as it contains letters from Paul Child to his brother about Julia (obtained from an academic library) that are out of context, and Powell's sloppy approach is the antithesis of Child's meticulous approach to her culinary education. And a little too much information about Powell's medical woes, without tying them into her motivation for undertaking the project. I recommend the movie, and in addition, Child's autobiography, My Life in France, the recent biography of Child, Dearie, and As Always, Julia, a collection of Child's letters to Avis de Voto, who was chief cheerleader for what became the masterful cookbooks.(less)",,1

Her candor and humor about it is what makes this book interesting. If it were JUST about how to make each dish, where would the human interest be? If anything, there was TOO MUCH about the gross aspects of food prep for me! I hardly thought she used the F-word THAT much. And I never use it myself, and don't really care for the overuse of it (""Six Feet Under"" now, great show, but THEY use it wayyyy too much).

It could say stuff you don't like. Most the folks I know are real tired of that sort of holier-than-thou posturing.

On the other hand, I felt like I was reading a book one of my friends had written. The narcissism gets a little grating, but that's what we're like. That's the nature of the 30s 40s crowd. The swearing... well, again, I don't know too many people who don't talk that way. But the general sense of loss of purpose, of grandiose plans gone to hell, of plain old existential angst is far too familiar. One day we all realize that if you look like a marketing guy, work as a marketing guy, and aren't actively writing, painting, acting, inventing, crafting, whatever-- guess what? You're a marketing guy.

On a more practical level, it's one of those books that, as Julie herself describes, demonstrates all the possibilities out there to see a world larger than the one you'd settled into. It's the kind of book that makes you think 'huh, wonder what I could dive into?'

It's funny. I've laughed aloud while reading it. It's maybe a bit longer than needed, but it's easy reading.

She'd moved to New York to pursue an acting career, yet she was working as a secretary and she was having reproductive issues just as her biological clock was ticking. She decided to embark on a project - in the next year she was going to cook all 524 recipes in Julia Child's original cookbook, The Art of French Cooking. Her husband, Eric was supportive, and even suggested she start a blog to document her progress along the way. While listening to this book, you meet Julie's friends and family and learn of her accomplishments and frustrations. You learn about the recipes she creates and the difficulties she has finding some of the ingredients.

Julie & Julia, by Julie Powell is the story of ""The Project,"" as she began to call it. This book is about the recipes, her blog and her relationships with her friends and family. I downloaded the audio version of this book from iTunes after seeing people talk about it on Twitter. The author reads the book and she does a splendid job.

I have to admit that when I first heard about ""The Project,"" my first thought was, ""Why?"" We used to live in the culinary capitol of France and discovered food that even Carl wouldn't eat. But, after listening to Julie for a little while, I was rooting for her and ""The Project."" Most bloggers can relate to her joy at receiving 36 hits early on (she knew because she'd checked her stats 12 times that day) and receiving her first comment. This audiobook made me laugh (a lot) and even got me teary-eyed at one point. The author has quite the potty mouth, so this is not one to listen to with your children.

First, I adore Julie's authorial voice. It's honest and forthright. She's entitled to her political beliefs, her somewhat unconventional lifestyle (snakes in Long Island City, yet!), and her use of the ""F"" word, a word that I myself have found to be highly therapeutic in situations of adversity. (If you are at all prone to strokes, I suggest you adopt this word immediately for its blood pressure reducing properties.)

Second, it was simply a brilliant idea. Imagine! Cooking Julia Child from cover to cover! Ingenious! Formidable, yes, but ingenious nonetheless.

Third, I found that I wanted to acquire Julie's spotted and dog-earred personal copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking because, like any good cook, I just KNOW she annotated the receipes. Personally, I pounced on the two examples of annotation she used in Julie and Julia and made the appropriate notes in my own cookbook. One note occurred in the frosting receipe and the other in the leg of lamb. (The French and, therefore, Julia Child are quite fond of aging their meat, a practice I myself would never risk. While aged meat DOES possess a full-bodied delightful flavor, the thought of having something rotting at home does not intrigue me. Julie Powell's less than hearty results of aging a leg of lamb in red wine for four days at room temperature bears me out. Better to leave the meat-aging business to the butcher!)

Fourth, this book re-kindled an interest in cooking which had gone dormant since I became an emancipated woman and an empty-nester. While I've always enjoyed cooking, somehow after twenty-odd years of standing in the grocery store aisle trying to second-guess the gustatory ticks of a finicky husband, I was just burnt out. When I saw the movie, and read this book, I found my culinary proclivities re-awakened and I immediately ordered Volume II of MtAoFC, as well as the DVDs of Julia Child's TV shows. Now that I'm ""free, white, and twenty-one"" I can cook whatever I danged well want to!

Winter can be a long, drawn-out business but not this year. And some of my neighbors don't know it yet, but they're going to be eating well. Thank you, Julie Powell, for providing the kick-start to a former passion. I suspect the ripple effect of this book is, for me, just beginning.",,1
136,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",4,Funny Memoir About Finding Your Way in the Modern World,Format: Hardcover,"""Julie and Julia"" is Julie Powell's memoir about the year she tried to cook all of Julia Child's recipes in ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" (MAoFC). Much like the movie with the same name, the book is as much about Julie's life--her marriage, her friendships, her thankless job--as it is about cooking. Unlike the movie, this book is really just about Julie, there is very little ""real"" Julia Child in this book. The only Julia in this book is the one in Julie's head, who almost like an imaginary friend, cheers Julie on as she make her way through MAoFC and helps her to discover an inner passion for cooking and how it brings people together.

I really enjoyed this book. I thought Julie was honest and funny about the challenges of being young and direction-less in modern urban America. I found it interesting to see how Julie used the project to discover a real passion in herself and to provide herself a purpose that ultimately led her to fulfilment (and an extra 15 pounds of butter weight!). That being said, I don't agree with everything that Julie said or did, and yes she could be a little self centered at times. But this is her memoir, so she has a right to share the world from her perspective.

If you are drawn to this book because you loved the movie--be warned, this Julie is a much more colorful (in both language and personality), well drawn character than the Julie in the movie, who in my opinion was sanitized into a typical romantic comedy heroine. Yes there are a lot of incidents that were in the movie that are also in the book. But the book is really about Julie and her life, not Julia Child. That being said, I loved both the book and the movie, but recognize them as two distinct works.

If you're interested in reading about how one woman found herself through the completion of an unreasonable project that most people would never even think of undertaking, this book is for you. It shows Julie's project as it was--with all of the messes, curses and challenges that it contained.

Julie Powell is candid, foul mouthed, angry, sarcastic and dramatic. I loved her. Seriously. She was so honest about her feelings, thoughts, desires and her life that I couldn't help but nod my head laughing because I can understand her! She even talks about the MAGGOTS IN HER SINK! How's that for honesty? ""Julie & Julia"" is not so much about Julia Childs, cooking, blogging as much as it is about Julie trying to find herself. She is turning 30, has a ""syndrome"" (as she calls Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) and isn't sure if she can have kids, stuck in a government secretarial position which was responsible for Ground Zero (the site where the World Trade Center Towers stood), married and living in New York City. On a trip to visit her parents in Texas, she snatches her mother's copy of Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume I"". Her husband, Eric, suggests she blogs about cooking through the cookbook. The rest, as they say, is history. She becomes an internet hit, all the while cussing her way through the cookbook (honestly, I cuss just making crepes, I can't imagine what it's like through Julia Child's meals), and trying to find herself. My favorite part was nearing the end, after Julia Child learns of Julie's project and doesn't ""care"" too much for it. (I just want to throw this in, Julia was pushing 90 when this was going on, probably cantakerous and not understanding about blogs, technology and the like) I loved it when Julie and Eric (her husband) visit Julia's kitchen at the Smithsonian and leaves a stick of butter (remember, Julia cooks French food. Read: lots of butter). Pure awesomeness.

If you are looking for a book about Julia Child, cooking or even blogging, keep looking. If you want a book about personal growth, while cooking through a Julia Child cookbook and blogging about it, then this book is for you. However, be forewarned, there is a LOT of cussing, talk about sex (not pornographic, just the subject of sex) and she is a Democrat who does some Republican bashing, not so much as bashing but gives them a hard time (none of these bother me, just a warning for those it might).

Like most people, I hadn't heard of Julie Powell or the Julie/Julia project until the movie with Amy Adams and the incomparable Meryl Streep (who should have got the best actress Oscar!) was released. The problem is that Amy Adams is not Julie Powell. She is waaaay too sweet. There is a sweetness that pervades the whole movie that made me go out and buy the book and read it to my wife while she cooked our dinners. The book was entertaining, and I love any story where the protagonist discovers herself and is transformed by overcoming obstacles and facing her demons. Julie Powell is an interesting character in her own right. The movie did her an injustice by portraying a marketable Hollywood characterization. The movie did well, and, I suppose, Julie Powell is happy about that, but, unfortunately, many people will be put off by the disparity between the sweet Amy Adams and the earthy, real, Julie Powell. After reading the book, I told my wife that the movie would have been more accurately cast with Sarah Silverman playing the role of Julie Powell. I don't know if it would have made as much money, but it would have been more honest.

I can imagine gaggles of church ladies running out to buy Julie & Julia after watching the movie and even selecting it for their book club. We know a few who did, and we had to laugh as we read the book and imagined their shock and horror at some of Julie's subject matter and language.

I don't know Julia Child. But I know she is a woman from another generation. I could see her rightly being put off by Julie Powell's sexual candor and not-for-general-audiences language. I kind of had a chip on my shoulder about Julia snubbing Julie in the movie (how could she do that to poor, sweet, Amy Adams?), but now I think I can understand where she was coming from. Unfortunately, Julia never really got to know Julie, and, in the end, I think she would have liked her. Julie Powell is a gifted thinker and writer, and in the end, a decent human being. I think Julie Powell honors the legacy of Julia Child.

Ultimately, I think, the book must judged on its own merits. It isn't deep, but it is human and entertaining. Julie Powell doesn't deserve much of the criticism she is getting in the reviews here, because people are really just condemning her for not being Amy Adams, a Hollywood fiction.

Julie Powell was like many failed actresses who had moved to New York before her...stuck in a dead end job. She was unhappy in her secretarial work for some government agency as are many people who labor at such menial occupations.

On the cusp of her 30th birthday, Julie recognized the trivial existence she had been inhabiting and determined that she needed some purpose in life. She was beckoned to what would be become her Bible for the next year...Mastering the Art of French Cooking by Julia Child. Julie resolved to cook her way through this intimidating collection of recipes within one year. Not only did she take on this daunting task, she decided to blog about her experience, which resulted in a group of followers, several interviews, and an eventual book deal.

What follows the introduction into the premise is 300 astonishing pages of anger, pain, laughter, frustration, adoration, and...butter. Julie deliciously (and sometimes disgustingly) describes, in detail, her journey into the foray of French cooking. We are thrilled with her when she accomplishes tasks such as bone marrow scraping and crepe flipping. We are aggravated alongside her through the poaching of eggs and the ever elusive task of mayonnaise making. We are enraptured with tart-a-palooza and squirm our way through aspics. We are even with her when she attempts culinary seduction by way of pecan spice cake with pecan icing.

Not only is there are relationship built with Julie but through her, and the apartments in her brain pan, we come to know Julia Child as a culinary genius and one Hell of a woman. I was even saddened when in the final pages of the book I learned that Julia Child died on the eve of her 92nd birthday.

This book is not strictly about food, though that is the central theme, but is also about people. We get to know Sally and are somewhat creeped out by the David's, we worry over Isabel's life altering choices, and enjoy Gwen's sexy IM romance. We are thankful for husband's as supportive and composed as Eric and wish Julie's mother would just calm down. What is there to say about Heathcliff other than...that's Heathcliff.

What can I say to express the sheer pleasure and delight that filled me with each turn of the page? I laughed, I cried, and I toiled. This book is inspirational to say the least. I was ravenous through the majority of its duration and my cravings would change as we grew deeper into the cookbook, beginning with potato soup and ending with a stuffed, pastry-wrapped duck. I found myself overflowing with the hunger to cook. I kept walking to my kitchen bookshelf to find and flip through my copy of Julia Child's The Way to Cook. Not only have I found myself wanting to create culinary masterpieces, I also was inspired to write. Julie Powell's voice is blunt, brutal, and honest. She has no qualms about using the word f*** whenever she sees fit, and sometimes even if it doesn't fit. She does not sugar coat her life to make it seem more desirable. She offers the reader nothing other than her self and her life. Take her as she as or do not take her at all...and balls to you if you don't like her!

All in all, this was quite a delectable read. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh and or if you simply want an uplifting, yet down and dirty read. I cannot wait to see what Julie comes out with next. Bon Appetite!!!",One person found this helpful,1

144,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",4,"Enjoyable, but not for everyone.",Format: Hardcover,"This book is a quick, funny, and intensely enjoyable read. The bulk of the text is not about the recipes, and you will certainly not learn how to Master the Art of French Cooking from this book. Rather than being focussed on the actual process of cooking, the writing centers on how said cooking affected the author's life: her job, her marriage, and her emotional state. This means that the book should be filed under 'memoir' as opposed to 'food essays,' but as far as I'm concerned 'how cooking affected my life' is just as legitimate (and interesting) a topic as 'how to cook.'

The author herself is a colorful character. She has a mouth like a sailor, drinks like a fish, and is an unapologetic liberal. Her sense of humor is wry, self-deprecating, and sometimes caustic. I understand why people with a lighter sense of humor find her whiny, insensitive, or just unfunny, but if (like me) your sense of humor verges towards the darkly snarky, you'll likely find her hilarious.

The prose is decent but not brilliant. The author will not be winning any Pulitzers. If you read this book for literary value, you will be disappointed. That doesn't make it any less entertaining; the book has many other redeeming qualities.

It's not true at all that foodies wouldn't enjoy this book, unless foodies don't enjoy reading anything but food essays (which this book verges on but is not). I am a foodie; I enjoyed this book. I am also, however, a member of the author's demographic (a 20-something, college-educated, financially struggling liberal) and I imagine this had a fair amount to do with my affection for the book.

To summarize: Foodies, do not be intimidated. You might very well enjoy the book. It is, however, not for everyone. If you are a 20-something liberal with foodie inclinations and a sarcastic sense of humor, I imagine that you'll like it. If you lean towards the right, insist upon impeccable prose, object to foul language (or heavy drinking, or questionable sex), and your humor is lighter- steer away.",10 people found this helpful,1

(This gives a big inspiration to 50 year olds!). Additionally, the blog she started as she worked her way through the recipes became successful. And, she wrote a book about all of this which resulted in a movie that will be coming out on August 7. Hating a daily job and loving cooking as a way to escape the horrid daily abuse is exceptionally written in this book....all about ""balance"" in one's life...

But I have to say that the book was wonderful. I loved her use of foul language almost as much as I loved her obsession with Mastering the Art of French Cooking. She makes something that would normally be rather boring to witness into something hilarious and charming. Yes she does use vulgar language throughout the book but I personally don't care. She has a knack for writing and a wit that cannot be compared with any other author I have ever read. She has a way of describing situations in a way that makes you say, ""I know exactly what you mean!"" even if you don't. Her frustration with life and cooking comes through so clearly with her words and yet leaves you feeling completely satisfied with how it turns out. Is it different from the movie? Of course, books always are. Is the movie better? Hell no! I enjoyed the movie but I LOVE the book. I checked it out from the library but I plan on purchasing it so I can read it whenever I feel like it. Not only is it a hilarious read but you also are left with this undeniable urge to try out some of Julie Child's recipes. I plan on doing just that on Valentine's day with Julia's Beef bourguignon. I'm sure it will be just as delicious as both Julie and Julia say it is and I am just so amazed that a book has inspired me to even try it. I do enjoy cooking and I do remember watching Julia Child when I was a child but I was never interested in buying a cook book of hers or even really learning more about the woman until reading this book. For that I thank Julie Powell for doing her project and then publishing this book. The people who didn't enjoy the book I can only say they didn't take the time really learn anything from it. If you just look at it as a book full of foul language you are missing the bigger picture entirely. If you haven't seen the movie yet, read the book first then watch it.

150,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",5,Loved it--lighten up!,Format: Mass Market Paperback,"I thought this was a fascinating and entertaining book. (The movie is good too...)

Looking at the positive and negative reviews, I'm struck by how judgmental many readers are. OK, so you didn't like the book. How many have tried to cook those recipes? How many have eaten the results? How many have worked at a demoralizing job? How many have lived in a small, old, poorly-laid-out apartment with a miserable kitchen? And how many have been discouraged?

I'm in my 60s so I remember Julia fondly from TV and I also remember how thrilled I was to get her cookbook as a gift when I was newly married and learning to cook. I've made many of the recipes and they are wonderful. The are also expensive and involved and a real undertaking--if you have all day. It's a completely different story if you have to shop, lug your groceries on public transportation, and then cook at the end of a day that has drained you emotionally. Julie Powell did a fabulous job of documenting how it all transpired and what the results were. I think it was a shame she was never able to meet the ""real"" Julia. A friend of mine did, and found her to be as charming as she seems in all her writings and programs.

Now, to the maggots. Living in an old building, working full-time, above a restaurant--I'm surprised she didn't have rats in bed with her. And I'm sure she learned a valuable lesson about cleaning up. The fact that she told about it says a lot, she could have left that out and nobody would have know how horrible it was. I'm sure she's not the first person to make a nasty discovery around the house and she won't be the last. Cut her some slack! PS A little cat hair never hurt anyone. PPS Julia was the one who dropped the chicken on the floor on TV and then picked it up, dusted it off, and declared that what happens in the kitchen is the cook's business, and besides, it's cooked!

This was a pheonmenal undertaking--remember, I've cooked a lot from this book so I know what I'm talking about--and Julie was desperate for some direction in her life. This project is how she found it. Her generation does stuff like blogging. I have never gotten into it but it fills a big need for many people. Just because folks are different is no reason to slam them.

And a bit about 9/11 too: Please, we all know it was a terrible tragedy. It's something our country will never forget. But to be forced to wallow in people's despair day in and day out takes its toll, and when said people are unhappy and frustrated and miserable it's awfully hard to keep your perspective. Her job was a position that should have been filled by a trained psychologist, not by a young woman with limited experience of life. I'm sure she did the best she could and I'm also sure that if she'd been able to find something more suitable to do she would have done it long before she resorted to the Julia/Julie project.

You can't have it both ways--put her down her for doing the cooking and the blog and then turn around and put her down because her job was awful and she wasn't coping very well.

With as many one star as five star verdicts you can't help but wonder at such enthusiasm at both ends of the spectrum. I thoroughly enjoyed this engaging biography but can see both sides of the argument. There IS a lot of profanity and more than a few melt-downs. Over and above all that I still saw the author's joy in her year long project to cook her way through a Julia Child classic cookbook. And if she didn't always enjoy the cooking she definitely enjoyed consuming the results. She is a woman who finds deep satisfaction in feeding her friends and family, in bringing a disparate group to her table and leaving them nourished and satisfied. For those who were appalled at how often she gave out too much information about sex and politics I can only wonder at what rock they've been living under. TMI is the norm in these Reality TV overloaded days. Julie Powell and her book is very much a product of the reigning culture.

While giving us an intimate portrait of her life we also see the less than glamorous side of living in the Big Apple. Their decaying apartment and its woes gave me the willies and I had never given any thought to the difficulty of a long subway ride home with numerous bags of groceries, including large bags of cat food and litter for her pets. I found it very easy to understand why her temper was frequently blown before she ever tackled her daily recipe. Many reviewers dismissed her as a narcissisicitic whiner. I felt such a judgement was unfair. She wasn't shy about faithfully describing her cooking disasters but I saw someone who, though meal preparation did not come easily, nevertheless muscled on until she prevailed. Certainly there were meals that bombed and she complained accordingly but there were many more successes and she was always faithful to give credit to any and all who helped make that happen. I found her friends and family tales varied and amusing and doubt she gave away any information about them that they had not approved.

While I enjoyed her description of recipes she tackled I'm not sure I could have joined her at the table. One thing that did cause me to cringe throughout her tales was her and her husband's cavalier disregard for cleanliness. They might have been able to eat with cat hair piling up and maggots under the drainboard but I certainly could not! Still, I wouldn't have missed reading about it and look forward to her next book with pleasure. Apparently she is now tackling the art of butchering meat. Remembering her description of gathering marrow from bones in JULIE AND JULIA hopefully she has acquired the proper tools for this latest adventure.",5 people found this helpful,1

I found Julie hysterical, whiny, prone to fits, snarky, and I didn't expect any cooking advice, just some excellent interpersonal stories.

Don't pick this up is you want to Master the Art of French Cooking. Don't pick it up if you want to glean expert recipe skills. In fact, if you are a foodie, you might not enjoy Powell and company's lack of appreciation for the more exotic delicacies. This is a book for anyone who enjoys a good memoir-this one just happens to be centered around the ultimate gourmet cookbook.

As a modern working woman, I appreciated Powell's shock at the time these recipes called for. Finding ingredients was hard enough (no supercenters for these people-they spent hours traipsing through neighborhoods for complete leg bones with marrow, or sugar cubes instead of granular sugar, or calves feet). Once the ingredients were tracked down, recipes took hours, If things went awry, Julie could be behind on dinner by 10:30 AM. Mixtures often needed to sit for ""at least 12 hours, preferably 24."" Everything was made from scratch. No quick gelatin-it was created from calves' feet, which ""makes your kitchen smell like a tannery...also, in my admittedly limited experience, it *tastes* like a tannery."" Mayonnaise was made from scratch, and ladyfingers from scratch were attempted so as not to use commercial ones and ""debase an otherwise remarkable dessert.""

Powell's book takes place post-9/11, and she comments on her job as a secretary in a government office overlooking ground zero, on the families who visit their windowed conference room, and on her data entry job receiving surveys about the 9/11 memorial. She also lived in NY through the 2003 blackout, and there is a beautiful chapter about the candlelight dinner she made for her NY refugees on the night of the power outage.

Overall this is a terrific read IF you read my caveats and didn't come looking to Master the Art of French Cooking. For anyone who was a fan of this book, also try A.J. Jacobs' The Know-It-All.

More butter!",Format: Hardcover,"I am so saddened to read the negative reviews to Julie Powell's memoir. Personally, I found Julie's honesty about her life and her Project funny, relateable and inspiring. I think it has much more in common with the best ""chick lit"" (think Jennifer Weiner) than it does with food memoirs. As a married woman nearing her 30th birthday, I found myself connecting in so many ways to Julie's story. I recognize her anxiety over a seemingly dead-end job, the desire to keep up with your peers when it comes to fashion and flair, and the dreaded biological clock that keeps ticking even when you're not sure how you keep yourself alive from day to day.

No, this book is not really about the cooking, it is much more than that. It's about a real woman finding her own personal happiness- Julie herself points to the true joy she found by being wrapped in Julia's world for a little while everyday. Real women drink, swear, mess up recipes, spill things on countertops, and, yes, we whine too. But Julie also writes about her real capacity for love- especially her love for her husband, family, friends and the great Julia Child.

While Julia may not have approved of Julie, I certainly do. As so many reviewers have pointed out it may be a generational thing and I can support that. Every book is not for everyone, but I found it refreshing that Julie could be honest enough to document all her imperfections and failures along with her successes.

And when other other godparents both passed away last year, my sister inherited the dining table, china and cookbook, including a copy from my Mom saying, ""Thank you for being such a gracious hostess.""

So we could relate to Julie - a second-generation inheriter of the book but hapless cook and confused about the direction of her life.

Seriously? Did these people wake up yesterday and have no way of realizing that movies made from books are rarely exact matches and, in fact, each really needs to be taken as a separate thing? Did they think they had woken up in alternate book-and-movie-twin universe? Did they possibly not realize, despite the fact that the movie is about writing it, that there is an entire huge available BLOG they could have spent seconds going to and previewing Julie Powell's writing style before buying the book and whining about how it's not like the movie in utterly useless Amazon reviews? No? Really? REALLY?

Diatribe aside, I have not seen the movie, and did not intend to see the movie until I'd read the book and put it aside for at least a good three or four months. So now that I've read the book, I'll probably catch the movie on cable sometime next year. Because I don't want the experience of reading the book to taint my enjoyment of the movie (HINT!), and because honestly something about Meryl's Streep's performance in the previews annoys me. Personally, I found the book completely charming. Julie sounds very much like someone who I could be friends with. And I appreciate that even though she decided to step onto a world stage (the internet is a world stage, even if no one is looking in your direction), she did it as herself. Sometimes strong, sometimes full of self-pity, sometimes over expletive-laden in her choice of expression, sometimes stupid in her choice of footwear, always very real and often charmingly witty, she is always herself.

This book is written by a real person, about her real life. It is amusing, and painful, and has some honest introspective discussion that certainly makes ME think about some of the food choices I make. And some of the life choices I make. It has also done a great job of rousing my interest in French cooking. Do I want to do what she sets out to do? Hell no? Do I want to make that one recipe with the breadcrumb encrusted liver? Awfully much. This book is NOT the cute PG-13 version of Julie, interwoven with Julia Child's own story. This book is the R-rated, sometimes even X-rated real life version of Julie, the real Julie, with a teeny bit of Julia Child for purposes of clarifying references. Let me say it again, this book is JULIE'S story as told by JULIE. If you want a cutsy Amy Adams version of Julie, watch the movie again. If you want to know more about Julia Childs, read a book about Julia Childs. If you are interested in what really happened to Julie in this year that she took on this amazing challenge, well, this would be a place to start. Did she sound whiny? Sometimes yes. But I think anyone who's ever worked a fulltime job and taken on a big project at home at the same time can kind of sympathize with that. I know I can.

On a side note, I read that Julia Child said that if Julie had trouble with the recipes, Julie must not be much of a cook. It kind of makes me wonder what universe Julia Child lives in, because just about any professional chef will tell you that classical French cooking, the kind Julia Child is all about, is one of the more difficult cuisines to master. And saying that about someone who basically revived her pretty mediocre cookbook after years of obscurity, makes Julia Child sound like kind of a self-involved bitch.

I haven't been able to eat lobster since, and have eaten very little chicken. But I did go out and buy a lot of butter, and cooked with it more often.

Despite the fact that I would not befriend the author in real life and found her at times to be self-centered and unlikeable, I found myself rooting for her in the end. I suspect the original blogs helped to keep her honest in recreating the experience of this year in her life.

I can relate to being at a point your life where nothing is how you really want it to be and yet you aren't ready to really look at the necessity of making a change and instead throw yourself into a new project to mask that fact.

201,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",4,"Brilliant, hilarious, and profound",Format: Mass Market Paperback,"This book was delightful and inspiring. Some people have said it's misleadingly titled, that it's a disappointment to discover that the book's more about Julie Powell's personal life than about Julia Child, the famed chef, or how to cook like Julia Child. I didn't buy it to learn how to cook, or even to learn about someone else learning how to cook. I bought it because I wanted to read about someone's journey (destination unimportant), and have a good time doing it. ""Julie & Julia"" was hilarious, endearing, very well written, and profound. It was about so much more than cooking - it was about the writer's use of tackling the Julia Child tomb of French food as a way to rediscover her own path and joy in life. I'd buy a book called ""Jim and Jimmy"" about some guy named Jim tracing Jimmy Carter's campaign trail back in the day for the same reasons, assuming it was as funny and honest as ""Julie & Julia."" And I'm not even that interested in politics - or French cooking, for that matter. Furthermore, I did not get the impression that ""Julie didn't really like Julia all that much,"" as observed by one customer reviewer. Au contraire. Julie's outbursts at some of Julia's more maddening recipes seemed loaded with affection and respect. They also seemed to compliment Julia Child's own salty attitude towards cooking and life in general, from what I've read. As for the ""late 20s/early 30s"" demographic recommended, I'm crawling up the backside of 40 myself, and in no way did I find her book to be age-specific. That's the beauty of an honest, well-written story - it defies words like marketing, demographics, and strategies. It just is. And this is one book I heartily recommend to anyone who's ever struggled with their own sense of themselves, enjoys a salty and witty read, and is looking for some bare bones, edgy reflection.",4 people found this helpful,1

If you're an over-sensitive, self-righteous right-winger with absolutely no sense of humor, then I submit you probably wouldn't enjoy it, so don't go out and buy/borrow it and trash the overall rating of this book with your negative criticism that focuses on your opinion of the author personally and detracts from what the book is about and its clever writing.

This is a MEMOIR, people. The author is being herself both in her writing style/language and her opinions. That's what a memoir is. Why should she change the way she speaks or modify her views to please anyone? You don't have to agree with her to enjoy the book for what it is, a humorous account of a year-long cooking project and her blog writing that resulted from it and subsequently became the book.

If you're any type of foodie, amateur gourmet or even just the occasional home cook, you should really enjoy this book. And even if you're none of these, you should still appreciate the original idea for a memoir and Powell's writing. I found some parts laugh-out-loud funny, like dragging a live lobster home from Manhattan, or interesting such as when she goes in search of bone marrow. I also enjoyed the interstices of Julia and Paul Child that the author imagined and constructed throughout the book. She has a tremendous amount of respect for Julia that comes through regardless of what you think of Julie as a person.

I recommended this book for our monthly book club and we're all planning to emulate Julie's efforts by creating some of Julia's recipes ourselves and sharing our experiences (along with the food) at our next meeting.

When I tell him it's about a woman who is cooking her way through a Julia Child cookbook, he looks nonplussed. The author, Julie Powell, reads her own work very well; her intonation and comedic timing are dead on. She is very irreverent ( I love how she refers to Julia Child as ""JC""!) and does have a fairly foul mouth, but I have to say that I find this refreshing. So many foodie books seem to take themselves all too seriously. Like my favorite food writer Ruth Reichl, Julie Powell shows that she loves food but isn't a Food Snob.

It makes me happy to hear about other young women chefs who aren't afraid to eat elegantly or to have the occasional carb. You may also be interested in a cookbook/memoir called NOT ON LOVE ALONE by Jessie Carry Saunders. Similar to Julie's idea, NOT ON LOVE ALONE is built around one year of cooking -- specifically, it divides the first year of a newlywed couple's marriage into 12 months, with little stories and recipes for each of the months. It's charming and witty, and utterly appealing, just like Julie.

Julie Powell was 29 years old, for crying out loud; she was (and I'm sure is) smart, creative, funny and honest. Quadruple whammy of ""gifts"" (or curses) - what would you do with a frantic soul? I don't know about you, but I am completely inspired by the idea of taking a concrete project with set parameters, and attempting to focus that all that energy on Just Plain Doing It.

As an artist myself, I love artistic busywork; it frees your mind, streamlines your frenzy, and lets the people you live with have at least some vague idea of what to expect. I also love to cook, but only if it's monumental - I think Julia Child was a perfect choice, as opposed to, say, all the recipes in the Time-Life Casserole book.

So my point is, that Julie's experience appears to be VERY focused on the food she is recreating; maybe not so much in a physics-of-cooking kind of way, but, as she says, in the sexiness of handling, serving, and experimenting with it. My personal favorite form of self expression (that I can write here) is drawing what I see - to me, that is infinitely more fascinating to me and translatable to others than drawing what only I can imagine. Seems like that's what this book is about. Meat and Potatoes French Cooking. And why would she, or anyone, WANT to seperate their everyday lives from their ""project""? What would be the reason for that?

And for the comments from those who are put off by Julie's dissatisfaction with her life at the time, it would be horribly depressing to read a book by someone who just loved answering phones and changing toner, wouldn't it? I mean, look at what she HAS done - what do people want from other people? Lighten up. I think an attempt at Something, Anything (and a successful attempt in this case) should be congratulated.

For those of you that have perused and became enthused by a funny, wise-cracking, long suffering true american sick of the flag waving sycophants I'm sure that you would agree this book is a long time coming for young american women.

Really, who of us hasn't tried something so utterly outside of ourselves and gotten so completely off field that you end up losing your sanity for a moment only to find out that taking chances is what life is all about. If you haven't done it, you haven't lived it.

This book is well written, if you like this style of writing (i.e. peruse before allowing your children to read). Women have long suffered the cross of having to be proper and full of good moral code. Really, I'm glad that at least one young woman was willing to stick her neck out in public.

Anyone who has learned to cook the hard way, that is through cookbook after cookbook, would have to appreciate this book. If you never had to learn the hard way, kiss your mentor and be glad you haven't experienced the constant frustations Julie had too (if a bit overly done).

I'd especially recommend it to people trying to figure out what to do with their lives, or people who remember how painful that process is.

It is one to dislike this or that character in a book, but to find that the writing style, the use of language, the constant denigrating of anything or anyone on a whim and the laissez Faire attitude displayed regarding anyone or any situation she deemed as non traditional was somewhat disgusting.

Frankly, it's rather boring to read about cooking, dirty kitchens, failed recipes, etc., over and over. There's enough of that at my house. Visually, those things only entertained me in the movie. The excerpts from Julia's life were much more interesting in the movie; in the book, they were very, very short, although I realize that the movie had more to work with since Nora Ephron adapted parts of Julia's book, My Life in France, into the movie.

Often, a chapter would begin with Julie in a new situation; however, she would veer off topic for a number of pages, and by the time she returned to the subject, it was hard to remember the start.

Or more bluntly she states – ‘in the physical act of cooking, especially something complex or plain old hard to handle, dwelled unsuspected reservoirs of arousal both gastronomic and sexual…’ But neither the cooking nor the sex lives we read in Julie/Julia, is sexy. I was not seduced but I must be one in the category that Julie calls ‘culinarily depraved’.

There’s a difference between blogging and writing a book. In a book, as a reader I expect to adventure vicariously with the narrator/protagonist, and come out a little transformed by the experience. Blogging can be rather more voyeuristic; one can scan, much like the flaneur of the Paris boulevards, and watch as an outsider. The internet encourages such scanning or ‘surfing’, not too deep, detached, even if you do ‘follow’, your expectations tend not to be demanding. You don’t have to read too deeply. Because one can sustain an audience with a blog doesn’t necessarily mean one can write; and what can work as a blog doesn’t in this instance work as a book. The narrative is all over the place and sometimes the sentences so unclear particularly when Julie digresses into an anecdote right in the middle of something, and by the time she gets back to the original train of thought, you’ve completely lost it. She can’t seem to stay focused. This is not so much Julie’s fault, as the editor’s. Surely, an editor could have made the book sharper, and cut out much of the drivel.",11 people found this helpful,0

The book is all about Julie and her friends with some writing now and then about preparing food that sounds very unappetizing. There is little about the Julia part of the story. In fact, nothing about the book seem to make much sense to me. It's all about life with Julie, which most of the time is very confusing and often unpleasant.

Julie tells the story of her life in general mentioning food every now and then, being REALLY narcissistic and annoying while doing it. She talks about trivial things that you would not expect to find in the book if you've watched the movie (i.e. her couch, reading her father's french sex book and and play tickets gone to waste because of her car having to be towed, among others). I never leave a book unfinished, but with this one I felt like I had to, otherwise I might actually die of reading Julie complain about her life so much (I only read three chapters, btw).

My tongue is no stranger to four-letter words, and I occasionally slide one onto the written page, but Powell seriously overdoes it. I think that her writing skills are sufficient to describe pictorally the ludicriousness she encounters in NYC, right-wing politicians, etc. without so often resorting to the ""F bomb"" and its siblings. I tried very hard to find compassion for Powell's narcissism and hysteria by trying to remember how I felt when I was making a life-altering change as I approached 30.

No wonder Julia Child and Judith Jones were so turned off by it.

Yes, people speak like this sometimes in real life, but real life isn't a book, and yes, one can see at times that Powell is trying to be flippant or channel Erma Bombeck and her ilk, but it comes off here as perhaps a bit too true. Frankly, we just don't like the writer, and so we disengage from trusting in her as she spins what could have been a very interesting story.

Worse, one can see through references, allusions, and so on that Powell is obviously intelligent, but what a waste she has to muck it up with all the language. It just gets hard to take, page after page (and listening from Audible, the mispronunciation of everything French hurts the experience as well).

I bought this book the day it hit store shelves, just found it, no review first. It's now eight years later and I'm just finally forcing myself to get through it. I've tried. It's just so off-putting in so many ways.

There is also very little detail when it comes to the recipes.

333,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",1,Julie Childish,Format: Hardcover,"I purchased ""Julie and Julia"" with great anticipation after reading a positive review in a national magazine. The book is based on a terrific premise - author Julie Powell decided to tackle in one year all 524 recipes from Julia Child's seminal 1960s cookbook, ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume 1."" At the time, Powell was a temp secretary, and she initiated her ""project"" as a blog before Little, Brown came knocking. I really enjoy non-fiction about cooking and food. However, what I expected to be an homage to Julia Child turns out to be something else entirely. Really, the premise turns out to be nothing more than a gimmick. In essence, this book is not about Julia Child or even about cooking. It's simply a jokey memoir - the author's musings about her very average life during that year. In the end, ""Julie and Julia"" is an expanded blog by an amateur writer.

I approached this book imagining Powell as a talented cook trying to perfect her craft through Julia's cookbook. However, Powell apparently has no formal training; as a result, she often botches the recipes. That's not really a problem, because Powell probably spends as much time talking about her friends as she does about cooking. The times when she does discuss making the recipes end in one of two scenarios, 1) Powell and/or her husband somewhat grudgingly admits that the food tastes good or 2) Powell becomes hysterical, throws objects, or screams at her husband because the recipe is difficult. At one point, Powell even calls Julia Child a foul name because she cannot get a recipe to work. Not funny. I don't think that she needed to approach her ""project"" as a deadly serious endeavor; Julia Child certainly had a sense of humor. However, hearing her rant and rave is tiresome.

It's rare for me to finish a book and feel hostility toward the author. However, Powell essentially has commandeered the good will people have toward Julia Child and used it to justify this book, which really is just a memoir. In addition, it's a rather bad memoir because Powell does not have an interesting life. Powell tries to frame her project as an attempt to find her life's path. If she grew at all, then it's in a way not reflected in this book.

The blog probably was very enjoyable; however, a blog does not a book make. The next time I'm tempted to buy a book of this sort, I'll remember this bitter lesson. If you have a burning desire to read the ramblings of a somewhat hysterical New York secretary, then this book is for you. Otherwise, I cannot think of any reason to recommend it. Apparently, before her death, Julia Child heard about the author's ""project."" A journalist asked Julia for comment, and she refrained, noting that the author was not serious. As always, Julia was spot on; even in her nineties, she could tell the real deal.",113 people found this helpful,0

Where to begin?
First--Bad writing in general. Many others have mentioned the profanity, which doesn't bother me so much in itself. It's just that one suspects the writer uses it to avoid having to think of other words to describe things or to build up some kind of hipster credibility. After a while it became an extremely irritating mannerism. As did the constant discussions of dirt, sewage, body odor and general filth.
Second--Powell's writing makes the foods she cooked sound so dirty and gross I started to feel bilious every time she described another recipe. My aversion to anything Powell cooked just increased as the book continued, unfortunately. I cooked a lot of recipes from Mastering the Art in the 1970s, and it was hard for me to reconcile Ms. Child's wonderful recipes with the road-kill that Powell seemed to be cranking out.
Finally--It was bad enough when Powell set out a damaged, dirty, and possibly dangerous dessert for her Republican colleagues (I'm a life-long Dem and found this, like her other political comments, unbelievably unacceptable). I put the book down for good, however, when I got to the part when Powell described how funny it ultimately was to see an impaled lobster writhing on a cutting board, presumably fighting for its life. Followed quickly by her joyful epiphany that an S&M dungeon existed in lower Manhattan--Consider the possibilities! It's so cool! Powell crowed when she found this out.
At that point I decided Powell had some serious issues in general which didn't warrant wasting my time anymore with her book.
Ugh. As a couple of other viewers stated, I felt like I needed a shower and some brain bleach after that.
And to the reviewers who chalked up Powell's general nastiness to being a New Yorker, this born-in-Brooklyn reviewer would like to ask--did you miss the part about her being born and raised in Texas?",22 people found this helpful,0

I did finish it, but kept looking to see how far I had to go.

I was thinking the entire time I was reading it that she probably should've gone through a church cookbook and made simple recipes that she didn't grouse about and throw all-out tantrums while making them. Why she chose MTAoFC is beyond me, and then she bitched about it the entire time. Her husband must be very forgiving or a limp dish rag to put up with her. And reading about the maggots and dust and cat hair was sickening. I'm glad I never ate at her house.

And the woman is sex crazed and every chance she gets, she mentions her friend's sex lives and how food she's making is like sex or whatever. I think she needs help.

And her disparaging remarks about 9/11, I thought, were mean and heartless. And her HATE of Republicans was more than obvious because she, well, hates them.

We went through a phase of watching old videos of her so I am familiar with her life and mannerisms.
I was not surprised to see that on Amazon the majority of her reviewers gave her the lowest rating. Let's say also that the climax of the story as far as she is concerned is when she eats a poached egg and finds it surprisingly delicious. Every other building to a climax is sorely disappointing. To note is that early on we find out he French chef celebre is still alive and well, and obviously we think at some point a meeting will happen! Instead, we are told toward the end that the real Julia is not impressed by her American blogger counterpart. How different their personalities were. One was bright, generous, classy; the other was quintessentially self-centered. A quick read of her book preface alone suffices. (Because of the very sweet and likeable actress, the American blogger personality seems to have been redeemed somewhat in the film.)

Somehow it all ends boiling to virtue, to love. Doesn't it, always? Julia Child wouldn't have been Julia Child hadn't she been the loving, fun, bright and giving person she was. She believed in the sacredness of cooking and feeding our fellow human beings. Maybe the American Julie will learn this, the most important facet of her beloved Julia, and still rise to the occasion!
There is something about cooking that is so hard to express, but it is completely tied to loving, and serving, and the life of virtue. I am so glad I have ""met"" her. I have held on to this theme as I have cooked for family or guests, and in my cooking classes. So glad I did.",,0

The movie is actually an amalgamation of 2 books, the one by Julie Powell and one written by Julia Child about her life in France and how she came to write her famous cooking book. Maybe it should have been a tip off when the part of the movie I enjoyed more was the one focused on Julia Child, but I thought it was because Meryl Streep did such a fantastic job (Amy Adams was pretty good too but she was in a movie with Meryl Streep who looked like she was having a ball so how could she compete really).

The book started off well with the Julie searching for something meaningful to do which was possible within her present lifestyle options so she decided to cook because 1. she liked to cook 2. she liked to eat, especially dishes with copious amounts of butter and cheese 3. she had a cookbook with exotic and luxurious recipes to guide her 4. she, for the most part had access to the ingredients for the recipes and last but not least 5. she had the blog to release her frustrations, record her triumphs and readers to keep her on track and give her feedback (like people on diet who need to get encouragement). I liked the first section of the book when she is starting the Project, getting familiar with the ingredients and cooking processes and introducing her friends and co-workers but as the situation became harder and it started affecting her relationship with her husband in conjunction with her dislike for her job growing I felt the writing got more whiny with a woe is me air. In the end i finished it and have to say it was an OK book. Julie is a normal human who chose to challenge herself and she had regular human reactions to the stresses of one year of almost daily ""crises"". I don't think I would read this again but I will recommend it for people who are foodies and want to see what a regular person would do when faced with the multi step processes of French cooking, and using and eating insane amounts of butter.",,0

It gets off to a reasonable start as the author describes how she decided to try and spend a year preparing recipes from Julia Child's classic “Mastering the Art of French Cooking”. However, her flippant tone and lame attempts at humor as she describes tackling tough recipes and tracking down ingredients that are unusual or difficult to find quickly become tiring. She also spends far too much time on relationships with her husband, family and friends and we end up with an extended blog (which it started out as) rather than a unified book.

The cookery aspect becomes almost secondary. I can understand why some members of Julia Child's family felt Powell was cashing in on her name. If you are interested in the cooking aspect, I would recommend Julia Child's “My Life in France”.",One person found this helpful,0

It is one of my go-to movies to make me feel good, though I love the scenes with Julia better than the ones with Julie. This should have been my first clue that I might not like the book ""Julie and Julia"" as much because the scenes in the movie re Julia and her husband in France where she learned to cook and the travails of getting the cookbook published as they moved from country to country and home to home didn't actually come out of this book, but was based on another book about Julia.

I went back and forth between liking Julie in the movie and, as it turned out, I disliked her more in this book as we were exposed to more of her temper tantrums and hatred of where she worked (and Republicans) and issues with herself and her husband. She came across as very immature at times, even insensitive in some ways...even as she was too sensitive in other ways. Honestly, I didn't find the book funny and it was gross at times. Did we really need that much detail about how nasty their plumbing was and how their lack of cleaning during her cooking project resulted in flies and worse?

I think I like Julie better in the movie due to the sweet urchin appeal of the actress, not due to the character she is portraying. I have no desire to read this author's second book or any blog by her. Sorry to say, I love the idea of this book (loving cooking), but it pales in comparison to the movie that resulted. Read ""My Life In France"" about Julia instead. Maybe, if they hadn't made such a good movie I would have liked the book better. I admire the author's willingness to put her life out for all to see, but I think a few more writing classes might have improved matters. She has talent and a cook angle on incorporating cooking and life's lessons, but maybe needs to learn about what to leave out of a book as much as what to put in.",One person found this helpful,0

Julie and Julia is not worth even the attempted read. The language! Way too much information on intimacy! More language!

I have two hundred pages left and now realize that no matter how engagingly Julie Powell writes about lobster, chocolate, and - and I can't even think of a third food item to round out that list! - this book is not worth any more time. It's the Lord of the Flies of foodie lit. It's the book I've been forcing myself to attempt to finish just for the sake of saying ""I finished!"" - much like Julie herself is forcing herself through Julia Child's (bless her) Mastering the Art of French Cooking.

My first objection was the repeated reference to the effects of PCOS as becoming ""fat, hairy, and disgusting."" I'm glad Julie Powell has such a high opinion of others afflicted with that same medical condition. After that it was the nod to authors like Anne McCaffrey, calling their work ""junk"" compared to the more high brow fare this obviously prodigal writer was blessed with because her father caught her reading a specific magazine. Julie Powell, you stand on the shoulders of writers who have done the journey of self-discover with much more flare and grace than you seem capable of mustering.

Anyway, I also noticed that many of the negative reviewers here didn't even finish the book because it was too painful to read.

The movie had been so fabulous and my experience has taught me to think that the book is usually even better....

...and boy, was I wrong!

There is so little about Julia and about food in this book, it bothers me that it is marketed as such. I am appalled Julia Child's name even appears in this waste of prose honestly, and I can usually find something redeeming in everything I read. The author complains about cooking more than she seems to enjoy it. She spends much more time writing about odd friends with weird sex lives (or her lack thereof) and using an obscene amount of curse words that there is no time to appreciate what Julia did for the culinary world. ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" is seen by Powell as a torture manual instead of the accessible, liberating cookbook it has been for Ameican cooks. The tone is nasty and self-righteous and demoralizing. People probably want to cook less after reading this book, which is not what you'd expect from a supposed cooking memoir.

All in all: if you liked the movie, if you like food and/or cooking, if you love Julia Child, even if you like reading anything in general...please don't waste your time!

(my parents would kill me if I put that much public info about their private life into a book.

But in between you read about her government job, which she doesn't like, but what she complains about doesn't sound that horrible.

Just do something about it! But I guess that's where the 'project' got started. Worst is I get the impression she doesn't even like to cook (in the book she says she started to impress the guy she ends up marrying). That's not really a passion for cooking, but just an attempt to bait a guy.

As for the cookbook, she tackles all recipes. It seems like she did them in order, which makes no sense to me, as I think you'd want to bounce around for variety's sake. But there almost isn't enough cooking in this cooking memoir, and in between you hear about her eccentric friends, selling her eggs for money (and her fertility issue) and her supportive husband and her blog and some of the attention she gets.

While not a book I would normally choose to read, it looked interesting enough that I decided to give it a chance. I do like to cook, and I know that there's the possibility for much success, failure, and hilarity in the kitchen. And seeing as this book was about one woman's quest to cook her way through a famous (if rather formidable) cookbook, I figured it would be entertaining.

Sadly, this book was a major disappointment. I went in expecting at least some humor and pathos, and instead got what mostly amounts to a lot of whining.

""Julie and Julia"" chronicles roughly a year in the life of author/blogger Julie Powell, who at this stage in her life is a wannabe actress who works a series of temp jobs in New York City. On a whim, one day she decides to relieve the boredom and stress of her empty-feeling life through a self-imposed challenge -- cook every recipe in Julia Child's book ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking Vol. 1"" in the course of a year, and write a blog about her experiences. What follows is weeks of agonizing over failed recipes, searching New York for a range of ingredients from sugar cubes to marrow bones, and driving friends and family crazy with her newfound obsession.

I went into this book expecting to find some amount of humor, as any cook can attest that cooking can be wildly funny, even (and especially) if the recipe gets botched along the way. Instead, ""Julie and Julia"" consists mainly of endless whining and tantrums on the part of the neurotic author/protagonist as she realizes she's bitten off way more than she can chew. Instead of giving up or altering her goal to something a bit more manageable (such as giving herself more than a year to make over 500 recipes), she instead swears profusely, throws fits when things don't go her way, and takes out her frustrations on her long-suffering husband and equally neurotic friends. Some people might find this kind of thing funny in a malicious, schadenfreude sort of way, but I found it uncomfortable in small doses and just plain tiresome in a book-sized dose.

About the profanity -- I don't particularly care if an author swears on occasion in a book, especially a memoir. But the casual use of the ""F"" word bothers me, especially when it's used with such frequency that you wonder if the author knows any other descriptive words. It's not as bad as ""The Big Lebowski,"" but it's annoying to me.

Also, the book seems to be trying to get a lot of its laughs from shock value. Maybe I'm a prude, but I don't find such things as making light of the families of 9/11 victims, comparing a raw chicken to a sex-crime victim, or describing a homeless person's mental breakdown particularly funny. That's not to say there's no humor to be had from a shocking situation, but that seems to be all that Powell is capable of finding humor in. (Also if someone reads ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" and is reminded of ""The Joy of Sex,"" I have to wonder if they have other issues...)

I really wanted to give this book something other than a one-star rating, as I don't like to throw out single-star ratings right and left. But this book was beyond unfunny and uninteresting -- it was unpleasant to read as well. I only got halfway through the book before finally giving up, and find I really can't recommend it to anybody. It's not a good cooking memoir or a good memoir period, and its reliance on shock value in place of humor gets tiring fast.

I've read hundreds of blogs, and they are either blogs by really boring people sharing excruciatingly dull details of their uninteresting lives, or blogs with a theme. Luckily, this book falls into the latter category.

Julie Powell is a good writer, no doubt. Her year-long project, cooking her way through Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking,"" is a great subject for a blog. How could this book NOT get five stars?

I really enjoyed reading about Julia's life--her courtship of, and marriage to, Paul Child, and her emergence as a world-class chef. Powell does a good job with weaving Julia's story through the book, and she doesn't split her story with Julia's 50/50, which is what I had expected. Instead, she uses her Julia anecdotes like seasoning, or a thoughtfully-chosen fine wine.

Also, she peppers the book with references to ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and its creator, Joss Whedon. We're big Buffy fans in this house (some, like my husband and daughter, moreso than others) and it was really fun to run across Buffy-related comments. Powell also mentions Max Brooks's ""Zombie Outbreak Survival Guide"" in her recommended reading list, which is my youngest son's all-time most favorite book in the entire world, so that was cool.

Those things were enjoyable.

What I did NOT like about the book was Powell's snarkiness. At first it was amusing to read these little asides about her co-workers, but then it started to grate on me. Powell works as a secretary for a government agency during this cooking project, and part of her job involves sifting through suggestions for a 9/11 memorial. People from all over would send her their ideas, and she has to sort through them--which sounds really depressing. But she actually mocks these submissions, and the grief-stricken people who took the time to mail them in. She also has nothing but contempt for fellow employees who don't share her party affiliation. It's very interesting that she views herself as an open-minded person, and yet is such an unrepentant snob. Maybe she thinks she HAS to be mean, living in New York and all, or maybe she thinks this cattiness is cute.

I don't know. I am glad I read the book, but I'm also glad I don't move in the same circles as Powell. At one point, she learns that Julia Child has heard about her project, and that Child was ""a pill"" when the topic was brought up.

After reading about the wondrous slimming powers of French eating in Will Clower's ""The Fat Fallacy: The French Diet Secrets to Permanent Weight Loss"" and ""The French Don't Diet Plan: 10 Simple Steps to Stay Thin for Life,"" along with Mireille Guiliano's ""French Women Don't Get Fat,"" Michel Montignac's ""The French Diet: Why French Women Don't Get Fat"" and multiple cookbook dieting diatribe offerings from mega home shopping diva Suzanne Sommers, unsophisticated Americans from the west to east coast want to know if eating stick after stick of butter really will allow you to fit into that fabulous pencil skirt without the corseting muffin-top effect of a good body shaper. Well, here's what blogger and now writer Julie Powell, back in 2002, found out when she took it on the cuff (or hips) for the rest of us.

Deciding that her ""government drone"" secretarial job did not provide her with enough stimulation, she embarks upon her Julie/Julia Project, a foodie blog where she cooks and comments her way through Julia Child's definitive tome on French cuisine, ""Mastering The Art of French Cooking, Volume One (1) (Fortieth - 40th - Anniversary Edition) (Vol 1)."" Trust me, Powell did not engage in this yearlong battle with French gastronomy for the sole purpose of discovering that yes, she would put on the pounds. I just made that up. I am not quite sure why the Austin Texas native did it all other than that once she started and realized that she did have a dedicated cyber-audience she had to continue to the bitter end.

Whatever the case, tipping the scale in the wrong direction may seem superfluous when compared with Powell's resulting jumpstart to her own career as blogger, now writer and, once this Friday rolls around, lead character in a Nora Ephron rom-com where the cutely efficient Amy Adams plays her as cozily married and knee-deep in dirty dishes in an apartment where the plumbing doesn't work and the maggots have more than enough unclean prep-time fodder to turn into a healthy swarm of flies. (Ugh--makes you wonder if you could ever be hungry in such an environment, doesn't it?) Powell's blog morphed into ""Julie and Julia"" a memoir of her year living in Long Island City, trekking to work in downtown Manhattan while whipping up quelque choses francaises in the evening as dictated by the pioneer of all television foodies--the oracle of all food oracles, Julia Child.

I never read Powell's blog. Unfortunately, although the site still exists, the entries are no longer available for anyone's reading pleasure. I guess ""Julie and Julia"" is supposed to suffice. Sadly, I don't know if it does. The premise while good takes an almost daily food blog and whittles it down to mainstream paperback size. Mixed in are a few italicized stories about Julia and Paul Child--an afterthought of sorts that seems to weakly pull Julie and Julia together as they, both as wives and women, attempt to find `projects' that add meaning and purpose to their respective lives. The result as pertaining to Julie comes across as disjointed with obviously missing pieces that only a daily reading of the on-line journal could rectify.

In addition to the blaring plot holes, Powell's stories about her friends leave much to be desired. I want to read about food--its preparation and the moments it creates as all those culinary smells take over that seedy apartment and convert it into a Mecca of Indulgence--not some goofy `Sex in the City' type hype about being young and living vicariously through a troop of Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and/or Miranda wannabes. What the heck! I surely do not want to consume all that butter, but as Julie and her husband, Eric (what a nice guy), did just that for me, I wanted to roll about with the abandon of that Roquefort filling and become lavishly enslaved within Julia's pastry recipe like some perfectly perfumed and rounded odalisque at Topkapi Palace. Allow me this foray into classic cuisine without the intrusive meddling of 21st century melodrama.

Bottom Line: Julie Powell, author of the blog ""the Julie/Julia Project"" converts her year's work into a memoir, ""Julie and Julia,"" relating her cooking experiences while mastering the art of French cooking ala Julia Child. From a literary standpoint, the book has some holes, evidently the result of attempting to stuff a year's journal into 300 plus pages like so much filling into a diet-sized crepe. Rather than the over exposed descriptions depicting the squalor of Powell's Long Island City apartment, her almost annoying comments regarding her disgust for anyone who isn't a liberal democrat and her disability to interject displeasure without using the `eff' word, more food adventures would have been welcome along with a more definitive notion as to why all this was done in the first place. Powell becomes a little fatter albeit much more famous while she proves that the French paradox remains just that no matter how old you are or where you live. I reserve my recommendation for after I see the upcoming film Julie & Julia [Theatrical Release]. (Added on August 7th: Saw the film which combines this memoir with Child's My Life in France (Movie Tie-In Edition) (Random House Movie Tie-In Books)--see the movie and skip the book.

Anybody with a blog seems to get a book deal. So you cooked her recipes for a year, big deal. Julia actually wrote those recipes and retested them and used them for a lifetime, not as a gimmick. But it was a gift and so I dutifully read it because I like to cook and it introduced me to Julia Child so I must say thanks for that. It led me to read My Life in France a few years ago (Julia's memoir)which I loved but now I am reading Dearie, a well written biography about Julia's whole life, not just the happy bits in France, by Bob Spitz.

366,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",1,The Over Indulged Ravings of a Screeching Harpy,Format: Mass Market Paperback,"I saw ""Julie & Julia"" about 2 years ago and it sparked my interest in Julia Child and learning more about cooking. A couple weeks ago I scored a cheap brand new copy of MtAoFC and I also picked up Child's autobiography, the collection of the correspondence between her and Avis deVoto, as well as Julie Powell's actual book.

I read the autobiography first and was absolutely enchanted. Then I moved on to Powell's book.

Wow.

Another Amazon reviewer put it PERFECTLY when she titled her review, ""Charming Movie, Ugly Book."" I'm not kidding. The movie is SOOOOOOOOO much better than the book because you actually kind of LIKE Julie in the film. After reading the book, I couldn't agree more with Judith Jones when she said that she and Child regarded Powell's blog as ""a stunt"" and her ""writing"" lacked substance regarding her task. She RARELY describes what she learns and how it tasted. The whole bloody thing is 200+ pages of her whining, flipping out, and acting like an immature brat.

I was absolutely horrified that she actually wrote about breaking the dish containing a posh dessert that she was taking to share with her office dominated by ""Republican bureaucrats."" She openly admits to leaving it on the counter with a note inviting coworkers to help themselves, while making sure to go warn the ""6 other Democrats"" in the office not to have any for fear of broken crockery in their food. I rarely have moments of wide-eyed, mouth-hanging-open-in-shock when I read a book but this took the cake. All I could think was, REALLY?! YOU ACTUALLY DID THIS?! What kind of a sociopath ARE YOU?! Look, I'm a liberal myself and regularly debate with my fellow conservative friends, but I would NEVER in a million years even CONSIDER serving food to anyone that could potentially hurt them simply because I disagree with their political views.

It only got worse when she described a temper tantrum she threw when a batch of mayonnaise didn't turn out. I can sympathize with losing your cool and violently flinging a bowl or a whisk into the sink and slamming a few cooking utensils down on counters. Honestly, who HASN'T done this at some point when their culinary skills are being tested beyond their limits. But screaming, sobbing and literally throwing tools and dishes about the kitchen, like an unrestrained 4 year old, making an even bigger mess, At age 30? I seriously began to wonder if this woman might need a year of professional therapy and possible medication rather than a self imposed cooking project.

Somehow, I slogged through the trenches of this woman's hysteria and finished the book. Usually, I always feel a slight twinge of melancholy after completing a story and knowing that there will be no more to enjoy. With Powell's narrative, I just felt relieved that my journey into the mind of an overindulged woman-child of dubious sanity was over. In fact, I had more questions than answers the chief of which being WHY did her husband stay with her this long?

While I'm pleased that the blog and film brought Child and her story and cookbook back into public awareness and introduced her to a new generation that might otherwise have never known about her, It grates on me that the vehicle for this were the ravings of a spoiled harpy.",7 people found this helpful,0

368,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",3,Witty but Full of Angst,Format: Mass Market Paperback,"Julie Powell, while working for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in the wake of 9/11 as a secretary, began the Julie/Julia project. She was going to cook her way through the 524 recipes in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking in one year and she was going to blog about it. Her sole purpose in attempting to slog her way through this classic recipe collection is to enliven her dreary life and who wouldn't feel the same? I would be depressed answering phone calls from the victims of 9/11 and people complaining about the LMDC's plans to rebuild the World Trade Center. This blog became the basis of her book and the movie entitled Julie and Julia, starring Amy Adams and Meryl Streep and serves to commemorate her process. She attempts to weave Julia Child's life in Paris into her memoir as it is during this time that Julia learns about French cooking in almost painful detail. Julie's blog is highlighted in the media, and this leads to a lucrative book deal.

The book was very well written (as opposed to her next memoir - Cleaving - which I read and disliked immensely) but I often got really tired about the whining, stress bucket that was Julie Powell. It gets a little old when you are constantly being told by the author how awful her job is, how awful her life is and why she's better than everyone because she's doing this project. There were times when she was very witty and pretty funny. I was impressed by the depth of Ms. Powell's research into Julia Child's life in Paris - she never met Julia Child (who died I think shortly after this project was done) so she had to look at letters written by both Ms. Child and her husband, Paul, as well as secondary resources - biographies and articles. I found that the interludes in which she created the scenes between Paul and Julia were too forced and were unnecessary. Julie could have told her own story without those brief interludes and they did nothing to move any part of the story forward. If I wanted to learn about Julia Child, I would have picked up a book about her.

369,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",2,Movie better than book,Format: Mass Market Paperback,"After seeing the movie and being surprised at how much I enjoyed a story presumably about cooking, which I don't do, I was eager to read the book it was based upon. Enjoying Julie Powell's sense of humor and blog style, I thought that a book could only provide more background and detail of the story that intrigued me.

That said, this is perhaps an instance in which a movie really was more than enough information. That time limit meant audiences got the gist of Powell's year of trying to complete all 524 recipes in Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking,"" without actually having to *see* them all. In the book, on the other hand, it felt as though we were with Powell for each and every recipe -- which I don't think even hardcore culinary afficionados would care for, instead preferring to hear about the highlights (like particularly humorous or disastrous results) and the end result.

In addition to the cooking project, Powell also writes about her personal dissatisfaction with her life as she approaches thirty. This includes her temp job working for a New York government agency, her husband and family, and the hijinks and problems of her close friends. While a bit of background is good, so that we know what motivated Powell to embrace such a project in the first place, a lot of the side anecdotes seemed like filler and just plain didn't ""go"" with the overall plot of the book, either.

370,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",3,A slice of life that's just not for me.,Format: Paperback,"Twenty-nine year old Julie Powell is finding herself at a crossroads in life. Due to her ""condition,"" she may find it rather hard to conceive if she waits ""too long,"" and this causes her to suddenly reevaluate her life. Her husband Eric encourages her to start a blog, which she does, called ""The Julie/Julia Project."" Embarking on a year-long project to cook all of the 536 recipes from ""Mastering The Art of French Cooking, Volume One,"" we follow Julie Powell through all of her ups and downs, including humorous tidbits about her apartment, her day job, her family and friends, her every day life, and her personal revelations as she ""masters"" the art of French cooking.

I find I have mixed feelings about this book. It's amusing, has taught me more about French cooking than I ever wanted to know, and made me care a bit about what happened in the real life of a woman I will (most likely) never, ever meet. At times, the book made me laugh aloud, and I found it engaging. Additionally, who doesn't enjoy a bit of schadenfreude now and again when reading about how someone is scrambling somewhat desperately in their efforts not to fail?

However, while reading I repeatedly kept wondering: When does she get to the point? To which I then reminded myself that I was essentially reading someone's diary. ""Real life"" does not have a point, whereas, most novels I read for pleasure do. Upon completing the novel, however, it still feels ""unfinished"" to me. Yes, it does come to an end point, but that doesn't feel like an end, and doesn't entirely seemed to have a point, a solid resolution, or a resounding message of all she learned, ready to be shared with the world. That could just be my opinion of it, however.

If you're someone looking for a complete and concise story (possibly, as I did, to compliment your enjoyment of a film), I would not recommend this book to you. If you enjoy reading ""slice of life"" stories (that may or may not feel like it has an ending to you), then grab this one, it's certainly got some funny bits in it.

One last thing: The deliberately fictional parts about the lives of Julia Child and her husband, Paul, were my favorite parts to this book. They make me look forward to any purely fictional work she may write.

372,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",2,"If all of us wrote a book like this, then we should all be famous!",Format: Mass Market Paperback,"As we know, Julie Powell was a woman who was on a mission. This mission was to cook everything in Julia Child's cookbook, ""Mastering The Art Of French Cooking,"" one recipe per day for an entire year. Then she would blog about it. As we also know, there was a movie starring Amy Adams as Julie Powell and Meryl Streep as Julia Child. The movie was decent, the book was aggravating, and I would ask that you refrain from reading the book and maybe check out the movie if you wish.

In the movie, we see Powell's adventures and how Julia Child began her culinary expeditions. In the book, we hear Julie Powell whine and complain and read letters from Julia Child during the mid-twentieth century. The moaning and groaning is just so much that I could find an equal amount of entertainment in a blog about the hardships of being a parent. Books that are written like this don't need to be published. What's even more hysterical is after this book was published, Powell was now declared a culinary expert and garnered more writing opportunities, one was about meat cleaving.

The only reason I am granting this book my original score of two stars out of five that I granted it when I first read it is because it does feature a goal and it does discuss the goal and how it was reached. It still doesn't make a difference between liking and disliking the book.

Don't assume your readers have seen every movie you've seen, or watched every TV show you've watched. Even though I got most of her references and could form a mental picture of what she was trying to describe, it was rather annoying. I kept thinking, ""This is the best description you could manage? Can you really be this lazy and still get published? What's happened to the publishing industry?"" Lazy, BAD writing, with only an occasional humorous remark--most of them lose their humor for their mean-spirited delivery or whining tone. Unfortunately, when not relying heavily on pop-culture references, there is frequent lapsing into over-writing and just trying way too hard. The middle ground would have been preferable. One quickly notices a significant lack of anything resembling depth here.

I also wonder, like other reviewers, if perhaps the author could expand her vocabulary a bit beyond expletives. She came across as coarse, unimaginative, and emotionally immature. The end result is anything but a journey of the soul. It's just time spent with someone who comes across as highly dysfunctional, not very likable, and in serious need of an Alcoholics Anonymous group. Their lives sound pathetic, even as we go on what could have been a really fascinating journey of growth and introspection. This is just a bitch-fest that leaves one wanting to send a condolence card to her ""sainted"" husband, Eric.

She begins early in the book describing a clearly mentally-ill woman in a subway station, who is hitting her head on the concrete as simply, ""The Loon"". Not a trace of compassion or empathy, just a dehumanizing, nasty descriptor, repeated numerous times. This narcissist simply saw in that person the set up for her own whining about her life. This made me cringe, and should have been the tip-off, the red flag, telling me this is not someone with whom I want to spend my valuable reading time. I should have listened to my gut in the first chapter.

375,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",3,Some insight beyond the blog,Format: Hardcover,"It is unusual to read a book, especially a memoir, where you find that the writer (who is supposed to be the protagonist) is not someone you can always emphathize with or even like. This is how I felt many times while reading Julie & Julia, and is probably why many people have a hard time with this book.
However I did not walk away feeling the book was entirely without merit.

After seeing the movie I was curious about Julie Powell and who she really is. Because if you've seen the movie you know it doesn't go into much detail about her life and really makes the year long project seem like it was a cake walk for the most part. Reading the book or Julie's old blog gives you real insight and it is interesting to see just how opposite the Julie Powell of the movie is portrayed.

The thing I can appreciate about Julie once I get past her self-loathing, foul mouth, bad housekeeping, and even her disregard for the sanctity of marriage, is that she succeeded in cooking from a 40 year old cookbook after most of us would have long given up.
I can also appreciate her struggle because I lived in Manhattan for a while. I know what it is like to have to shop for food everyday, to have to lug heavy groceries around town, and to cook in a very small ill-equipped kitchen (especially in an old building without modern conveniences). Knowing that makes her feat all the more admirable.

I think this book also suffers from poor editing. The story was a little all over the place, she'd talk about a dish she had to make and then stray off into some story about her friend's sex lives. Things didn't flow well and sentences sometimes rambled. I felt at times there was just fluff added to beef up the word count.

So while the book at times disgusted me and I couldn't help but judge her, I also found myself rooting for her. I've certainly had jobs I've hated and I've certainly fantacised about becoming a writer so I could quit my 9 to 5. But Julie actually did it, and I can take some inspriation from that.
I recommend reading it if you are a foodie or if you liked the movie and are intrigued, but I rented a copy from the library. Also you can still find her old blog online which goes more into the actual day to day cooking trials, whereas the book goes way more personal.",3 people found this helpful,0

She spews contempt for Republicans, Texans, New York and New Yorkers, has unnecessarily bad language throughout the book, and at one point finds it acceptable that a friend is engaging in Internet sex with a married co-worker on the opposite coast. Sorry, she's just not my kind of person.

Many people around age 30 are struggling to establish their identities and are trapped in mind-numbing directionless jobs. Like many, Julie found something to do: Cooking all 524 recipes from Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" in one year and blogging about it. No doubt this was a huge challenge that was personal stretch for her, but in my mind it's hardly anything notable. Lots of people stuck in dead-end jobs and mundane or unchallenging or in some way difficult lives(or not) undertake large personal challenges: they volunteer for non-profits, decide to run a marathon, write a novel, climb Mt. Everest or go back to school. Some of these efforts even contribute something to society in the end. Julie's challenege is no more exceptional than any of these and in many cases is less exceptional. So she cooked her way through an entire cookbook. So what? Why was the self-imposed timeline so important that it caused her enormous angst? Why does she live and work in New York if she hates it as much as she seems? It's never clear why she's there in the first place. And at the end of ""The Project"", she still remained a foul-mouthed, jaded New Yorker with contempt for people with personal views different than hers, except now she is one with a book and movie deal. I don't get it.

The writing was fragmented, the book frequently wandered, and it took me a long time to wade through the book. There was less about Julia Child and her life than I expected. And frankly Julia Child, who in her quest to accomplish something with her life in her 30's and 40's, gave us all something we could use: books and a television program that led to a sea change in the attitudes about food in the United States that was much needed in the 1960s and 70s. It's the reason she's still iconic today, even if some of the recipes are dated. And she managed to do it all with resorting to constant profanity.

If you want to learn more about Julia Child, read ""My Life in France."" While she also clearly identifies her political views, it was in the context of her lifelong disagreements with her father, which was clearly a personal struggle.

I keep hoping that the book will pick up, that something interesting will happen and make me want to finish it, but a sofa stuck in a staircase is sure not it.

I get frustrated when trying to force myself to finish a book, especially when I know that there are so many others that I have to force myself to put down and am disappointed when it does end.

I love cooking and eating so any book in which food serves as an integral role or an interesting plot device is appealing. I honestly think that the premise of the book was great in theory, but not as interesting in reality. My biggest complaint with the book was that the events were not strung together well enough to form a compelling plot. The whole book felt like a bunch of amusing blog posts strung together that were interesting, but didn't seem to come with any well definited climax or suspense. I'm sometimes willing to overlook this if the material is written in a beautiful or compelling way, but just did not find that. In addition, I felt like there was too much focus on her rise to fame and not enough on what had actually attracted me to the book in the first place, her cooking experiments and their role in her life. There simply was noting pushing me along to form an emotional connection with the author or to wonder what happened next. I also found it interesting that a book about such decedant and sensual food was written in such a way that the dishes didn't come to life. When I'm reading about food I like to feel like the descriptions make it as if I was tasting the food myself. Instead I personally found her writing voice a little annoying and at times as if it was trying a tad too hard. Granted, this is all a matter of personal taste and what is annoying to one could definitely be amusing or pleasant to another.

The movie wasn't good either by the way - except for the parts with Meryl Streep - she was fabulous, as always, but there was way too little of her.
This book was disgusting in so many ways, i.e. foul language, graphic depictions; things that could have been enjoyable to read were ruined by the way the author expresses herself.
Do not purchase this book unless you would enjoy hearing this author: (1) belittle everyone in New York; (2) make fun of the victims of 9-11; (3)lament about her body odors including the smell of her own waste product; (4) vividly describe the infestation of maggots, flies, cat hair, etc. in the very kitchen she uses to make all the food from Julia Child's cookbook (and serves to her friends); (5) bash the people she works with, and all other conservatives she repeatedly calls ""Republicans"" in a vein to equate this term with something most vile, and so on.
To illustrate what I am trying to convey, here is an excerpt from the book (she is talking about the death of Julia Child): It's the death that all wish for - well, either that or finding out you have a terminal brain tumor and going out and assassinating some plutocratic M____ F____ (words spelled out in book) who's systematically destroying America's democracy brick by brick, before you get shot down in a rain of glory. Or maybe that's just me.
The entire book is like this - I kept reading hoping for some more flavor of Julia Child - but it doesn't get better.
In fact, it gets most decidedly worse because at the end of the paperback version, there is an excerpt from this author's next book. Apparently, she has gone on to become a butcher, and the new book is even more graphic and depressing. She waxes on about her love of dismembering animals, and her admiration for the work of Jack the Ripper.
Awful, distasteful, sad.
She is right about one thing I am certain - Julia Child would not have liked her, not in the least.

The idea of living in the squalor and filth proudly described by an ostensibly middle class pair was stomach-turning. When the author revealed that she was trying to create a year's worth of dinners from Julia Child's classic, but somewhat arcane recipes from ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking,"" the reader gasps at the idea of anyone eating anything that Julie and her husband would touch. By her own admission, she and her husband smell bad, maintain terrible personal hygiene, never clean their apartment, have cat hair dusting all surfaces of the greasy, foul, hole of their kitchen, have maggots all over their drainboard and sink, and routinely have sewage back-ups all over their bathrooms. Julie leads the reader on a culinary nightmare. That Julie's quest to cook all of Child's recipes is an insipid idea, let alone the saving lynchpin of her life and marriage is just pathetic. The recounting of the experience is just sick-making.

So when she emailed me saying this book was ""LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY"" I immediately got a copy.

I'd once heard a librarian on NPR say ""Life is too short and there are too many good books out there to waste time reading one you don't like. If by 50 pages you're not into a book, say to yourself 'I gave it a try' and move on to something else.""

Well, by 50 pages I was just plain tired of listening to this author whine (and I hadn't even so much as smiled once, much less laughed out loud.) So I quickly skipped ahead about 20 pages at a time and yep...still whining. Frankly, life is hard enough without having to endure somebody else's self-induced dramas.

I'm still not sure exactly what my friend (and apparently other readers) find so much fun about this book, but I guess everything boils down to what makes you laugh. This didn't do it for me.

That being said, it was a Herculean effort to not toss this self-indulgent mess across the room 300+ pages ago and instead actually make it to the end.

First things first. Powell has to be the most narcissistic, neurotic, whiney, self-absorbed and ungrateful person I have encountered on paper. The scope of her self-absorption is something one encounters in a petulant teenager, but as 30 year old woman Powell seems to have retained that center-of-the-universe egoism, as well as the teenage angst. Her long-suffering husband Eric must be going for sainthood. Powell's dissatisfaction with all that is her life grows tiresome quickly. (I suppose reading about anyone else's identity crisis always is.) And her contempt for countless others knows no bounds. Republicans, Mid-Westerners, non-theater geeks, grieving families of 9/11 victims, co-workers, friends... and basically anyone she deems too uncool for her psudeo-hipster self. Lovely.

There seemed to be little continuity to the book. I had difficulty keeping track of time and Powell seemed to backtrack often. Add to this the constant filler of details and anecdotes about family and friends alike. While I was hoping for a real entry into Powell's day to day project, I could have done without the revelation of her father's extramarital affair, her friend's bizarre dream analysis, and another friend's sexual encounters with a married co-worker.

As a foodie, I picked up Julie & Julia hoping to be entertained by the magic of a meal well made. But that is not what Powell has shared. While I can admire the fact that she took on such a daunting project, I'm left wishing I had borrowed this one from the library and saved my eight bucks.",9 people found this helpful,0

Having read Julia's book about her life in France I was already familiar with the excerpts and quotes that Julie uses in the book. The first thing I found off-putting was her disclosure - that she made up portions of the book. OK, she was honest to admit this but if it was worded better I may have been less offended. Honestly I only read the first 15% of the book, then speed read/skimmed through the drivel and slowed down to read the cooking parts, it was THAT bad. The long parts between the cooking dialogue are filled with the occasional f* word, comments about her sexual frustrations, and depressing and mundane life. She is the epitome of the type of person I would not befriend - not very clean, pessimistic, likes to wallow in her own sorrow, a complainer. This book was a HUGE disappointment. Do yourself a favor and borrow it from a friend or the library. I'd be surprised if you finish it. Now I'm wondering if I should bother seeing the movie. **Update 01/10/10** I saw the movie last night and liked it. Nora Ephron did a fantastic job of leaving out a lot of the bad writing details/plot and spinning it through her lens, not Julie Powell's. I recognized a lot of the movie from having read ""My Life in France"" - that book is very well worth the read as it chronicles how Julia Child ended up being who she was.

I'm glad that I read it at the library first. The book is nothing at all like the movie.

What made the movie work is that it was mostly the chronicle of Julia Child's rise to success. The book, however, is Julie Powell's whiny stream-of-thought rant about life in general, in which she fixates on a ""project"" of compulsively cooking her way through ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" in one year.

The book is laced with continuous vulgarity, profanity, and paragraph-long sentences, and goes into disgusting detail about various bodily fluids, plugged sinks and sewage, filth, cat hair-encrusted grime, sexual references, etc. I'm surprised that no one got violently sick eating anything that was cooked under such conditions. I'm not surprised when, toward the end of the book, it's revealed that the kitchen is crawling with a hidden nest of maggots. Whenever life gets hard, Julie always has a few f-bombs to throw around, heavily laced with drinking and bitching, and navel-gazing self-centered ruminations.

About the only benefit of reading this book that it solved the mystery in the movie of why Julia Child disapproved of the apparent ""honor"" of being associated with such a person. Julia Child had far too much class to be associated with anything so crude and vulgar. In this book, you won't learn anything about her that you didn't already see in the movie, the book has maybe a dozen pages with brief vignettes about her early years with Paul. Julie Powell's ""mentor"" is a figment of her own imagination, and in her self-centered world, that's good enough.

I see that the next book is going to be about Julie working in a butcher shop. The sample chapter included describes how Julie attempts to wait on a customer, with blood-begrimed hands and clothing, and how she finds it amusing when the customer objects. This is just another example of the crud that readers endure in the first book. I think I'll pass.",7 people found this helpful,0

Julie is about to turn 30and decides that she needs a project. She decides to cook all of the recipes in Julia Child's MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING over one year and blog about it. This memoir chronciles that project.

The subject matter of this memoir had such potential but it ended up plodding along from one recipe to the next. Powell occasionally spices up the book with tidbits from her personal life and those of her friends. However, the book came to feel as if it were a list of recipes with a few life vignettes in between. I found it to be really slow. Powell herself seems to be charming and the reader is left wanting to know more about her and her life. Overall, however, the book fell flat for me. Perhaps the movie will prove more entertaining.

Julie & Julia is a very boring and unintelligible memoir to Julia Child (maybe) but more so a self-involved journaling/rambling of a person battling depression, cooking obsession and the beating of the ""biological clock."" Her half-a**ed attempts at recreating Julia Child's recipes left me with a bad taste in my mouth.

The author attempts to (and somewhat accomplishes) the re-creation of every recipe in Julia Childs renown cookbook (524 recipes) (Mastering the Art of French Cooking) in one year. She cooks things such as brains, liver, kidneys, marrow. The only humorous memory was that her Mother always said that kidneys always ""tasted like piss."" however some that the author cooked did not taste like piss, however her ""piss smelled like kidneys."" That was such a crude remark (and I am no priss mind you) I could not help but laugh.

The author wrote a blog and this book really made small mention of her blog, small mention of other characters. The only characters truly developed in this book is the author and her husband Eric. But even his character is truly never examined, just from the author's perspective minimally. This book was albout the author. My final impression of the book was that the author wants/wanted to have a baby, had to do something to occupy her mind besides thinking about having a baby or not being able to have a baby and the personal neglect in her kitchen can't help but be seen as depression.

I'm sorry but little flies flying around the author's kitchen constantly and finally towards the end of the book they discover maggots under their dish drying tray.

A quick read, Julie & Julia is NOT a memoir about Julia Child but a chronicle of one woman, on the edge of 30, settled into an average existence with her husband, cats and snake in a cramped NY apartment, who takes on a self-assigned project (The Julie/Julia Project to be precise)of foolish enormity. Julie Powell impulsively decides to give herself 1 year (circa 2004) to cook every recipe in the Julia Child tome Mastering the Art of French Cooking, all the while blogging each night about her experiences in executing this mission and gaining an interesting fan base.

As she digs into each complicated and buttery recipes (the amounts of butter and cream and cheese are enough to raise your HDL--or is it LDL?) it becomes clearly therapeutic, comical and all consuming to the author. The subtitle suggests that her marriage was possibly in peril by The Project but all I can say is that her husband is unfailingly supportive and surprisingly non-critical (but then again why should he have been--he ate like a French king for a year). Husband is sent on many a errand to find such ingredients as bone marrow, and often times a team of quirky friends would deploy with him. This book is ultimately about someone who needed focus in her life to distract her from (1) seeming difficulty she may have in bearing children and (2) the mediocrity of her secretarial job, which happens to be at a governmental agency that dealt/deals with 911 victims and aftermath. Yes, she is at times unsympathetic to it all but her complaining is more of the type that everyone complains about their job and not directed at the victims. Imagine dealing with that daily for years, she's just complaining about her job like so many entry/low-mid level employees do. She makes her politcal leanings quite clear, being in the minority at her office and to me, The Project was a way to infuse her life with adventure and challenge in a way that her life wasn't at that point. Is it perfect prose? No and in fact I did skim some paragraphs that went on a bit in overspecifying cooking technique but that did not stop me from enjoying it for what it was--a young woman's journey to connect to her life somehow. The path that she chose, albeit an oily, buttery one, was definitely interesting and this was a good quick read. To be clear, this is NOT a Julia Child memoir, there are no recipes (anyone expecting that would be dissapointed and should just buy the MtFAoFC and get the butter out or a bio book). Yes, the protagonist is young so she slings back cocktails while she's cooking (hello, so did Julia!) and she's a crappy housekeeper.

But where it becomes a bore, is when she tries to make a book of this. Perhaps if you are a near thirty-something unsuccessful woman you might relate. And certainly there is a great deal of chicklit in the world these days that might encourage such poor skills.

I read several reviewed in other places before starting my own. I wanted to be sure that my conceptions were not too obscure. I find many of the reviews similar to my own, but then when they are written Miss Powell seems to have defenders who don't judge on the merits of what she wrote or how she wrote this book, but that she is some kind of goddess.

She chose to write her tome as an autobiographical work, but so often we are given to asides about her friends and their dating habits, or certainly her casting a shadow upon the agency she worked for and the two political parties. There are many other places where these trips away from the cooking, the blogging, and the promotion of the blog are dribble. It makes the whole seem as verbal diarrhea. That is why the book fails, too much crud that has so little bearing only written so Julie plays on her readers to fall in love with her. Look at me, I'm a nice person.

So is this book disappointing? You bet it is. I cannot believe how disappointed I am to find out that this book is written so poorly. I might still watch the movie since it stars my favorite actress ... but after trying to read this book, I don't have much hopes for the movie either.

And I liked the little tidbits about Julia Childs and her husband. However, I got tired of the book after sixty - seventy pages of it. I found I was angry and disgusted by her total lack of sympathy for those who were trying to contribute to the 911 memorial as well as the families who have lost people in towers. Her condescension was more than I could handle. She and her friends were a bunch of whining self-absorbed twenty/thirty-somethings that believe the world revolved around them and their happiness. In the end I could not bring myself to read any farther. That's too bad. It should have been better given the concept.",One person found this helpful,0

Started with Julia's book and then moved to this one. I have never appreciated Nora Ephron so much until I saw what she did with this second class material.

I did love the bits of Paul's (Child) letters that separated a few of the chapters. This books cries out for more Paul. I seem to remember reading a movie review that called for more Julia and less Julie. That goes triple at least for this book.,4 people found this helpful,0

It was an interesting enough premise and this author can certainly write well, but I found her to be more than a little self-absorbed. Also, I thought she shared a little too much information about herself, her husband, her family and friends. Then, there is the matter of her four-letter words. If they bother you, beware! I kept waiting for the author to grow up a little. She seemed a little cavalier in the way she talked about the aftermath of 9/11, particularly about victims' families, the ""government agency"" she worked for, and people with a genuine interest who wanted to do something to help. I kept wondering if this was all part of the way she was coping/not coping with the events, herself. If so, that was never explained. Then there were parts of the book I found very off-putting, such as her dirty kitchen, flies and maggots. Unlike ""Under the Tuscan Sun,"" this book did not make me hungry. If you like reading about cooking and food, I would recommend instead anything by Ruth Reichl.

Obviously food (or its preparation) was the common tie between Julie and Julia, but the book is much more about Julia's quest to find herself through the admittedly odd project to cook her way through Julia Child's cookbook. The book is well-written though I often found myself frustrated with the author who seemed very immature in parts.

It was not at all about Julia Child. Julie was no working class girl if she was raised in a home with Mastering the Art of French Cooking in the kitchen. She'd been around the block a few times.
Julie did use the word f*** too much. It stopped being funny on about page 10. Her references to September 11 was tasteless even if they did revolve around her job as a secretary. Plus the writing in general was terrible. Julia Child should have been pissed at her. This story was tasteless.

I read the first chapter and wasn't impressed, so I didn't come back to it for months, until I finally broke down and finished it last weekend amongst laundry loads.

Like the other reviewers, I found the book to be very little about cooking, and more about a rather immature perspective on what seems to be a life with little to complain about. I didn't get the impression that Julie even LIKED to cook, so that kinda bothered me, since I thought it would be more of a celebration. She frankly struck me as someone with too much time on her hands who took on the ""Project"" merely for something to do.

Not so with this; it's actually the opposite with Julie&Julia. Especially since the Julie in the movie seemed so much nicer and likeable than she did in the book.

I read this over my first trip to France so I found myself delighted over the Julia parts of the book but not so much over Julie's. I admired Julie for her attempt to take on cooking every recipe in Julia's book, which after all is quite extensive, and I loved the way it brought her friends and family all together. I found her writing style humorous at times but boring other times, and those boring times seem to increase throughout the book.

What I didn't like was Julie. Although she had admirable qualities for sure, she appeared to be a rather self centered and immature with a lack of general respect for others. If you are young and a Julia fan you may find Julie more tolerable. But if you think having a child is cherishable; if you feel a deal of sorrow for families of 9-11; AND if you like a book to come together at the end, you may not want to read this.",4 people found this helpful,0
428,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",3,good and bad,Format: Mass Market Paperback,"I was very surprised by this book. I like the premise - blogging about cooking all the recipes in a classic, challenging cookbook and finding joy and a new career along the way. But the main character in this book is hateful. She comes across as that dorky co-worker in the cubicle next to you that you never wanted to know. Dorky is not hateful, but complete lack of character is. She envies her friends when they gravitate towards loser-behavior. (Her friend purposefully puts herself in the position of being used by a cheesy married man and Julie envies her.) She is ungrateful for what she has. She seems to think infidelity is cool. She's terrible to her husband and seems to have no control over her behavior and outbursts. She tells us how she puts the butter in her husband's bag without him knowing, as if that is cute and impish. It's closer to evil. She's afraid of turning into her mother, but aside from her mother's childish and disrespectful response to blog reader Clarence, the character in this book is much worse than her mother. She finds out when she's a child that her dad fell out of love with her mother and you wonder if Julie is testing her spouse's limits to see if he'll do the same. There are some mysteries in the book: Why would a guy as good as Eric stay with Julie in a city where there is a good-man drought? Why would anyone eat at her maggot-infested apartment? Why don't they hire a cleaning service, at least once? It's clear that she is very naïve and she doesn't know what it's like to date in the city or be in the midst of any kind of real hardship/war/tragedy. Her analogies are out of touch to the point of being painful, and she makes Democrats and liberals look really bad. The writing in the beginning is very bad, but picks up a little later. But I didn't give the book a one-star rating because, believe it or not, there are some pluses. For one thing, look at all the reviews. If a book is truly bad, I don't think this many people will feel moved to write. She gives us a character that we love to hate. She's everything we don't want to be. She describes herself as dirty, flabby, petty, hints at being bad in bed, not too bright, definitely not worldly, etc. Doesn't that honesty sort of make her a good writer? If she was truly narcissistic, wouldn't she cover up those aspects of her personality? (Unless she's just that clueless?!) In fact, she is honest enough to let the reader see that Eric and her brother are much better humans than she. Also, her descriptions of the cooking process are actually good and it's very cool that she finished each recipe, no matter what it took. The movie was delightful. I remember thinking the main character in the movie was dorky, but not hateful. In conclusion, I would read this book, but I'd get it at the library.",6 people found this helpful,0

This review will probably explain the negative ratings this book has been getting, in which a movie is being made that came out august 7st. First of all THIS IS ONLY HALF OF WHAT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT!!! The other half is another book by Julia Childs named ""My life in France"". THOSE TWO BOOKS MAKE UP THE BASIS FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE"". Yes I do agree that it's misleading, specially for anyone that watched the movie trailer. It makes you think that this book is completely based fo the movie. Now, I have read this book and yes it's too political for a cooking blog, too x-rated and a little off track when you really want to know about the cooking experiment process. But hey, it's her book and pretty much I don't blame her as she is trying to explain how her thoughts got formulated. And to tell you the thruth i believe this book is twice as long as it should be. So many details so many dead trees. The author Julie Powell did indeed took on a great culinary odyssey. And to match her enthusiasm for writing this book came about. Overall I give this book (3)three stars so the simple reason that it took me twice as long to read, cause of the unnecessary details.

That aside, the author (Julie Powell) comes across as a smug, complaining, selfish, mean spirited & condescending woman. The way she is so mean in how she talks about her co-workers and complains ceaselessly about her job, you just wish she'd quit (both the job and complaining).

And although I tend to be more liberal in my politics, even I had to wince at the amount of vitriol she spouted towards her co-workers who were Republicans and the President at the time (it takes place about a year after 9/11). People like this give liberals a bad name by being so hate filled, intolerant & downright nasty. She even managed to come across as insensitive & condescending to the 9/11 victims the agency she was temping for was supposed to be helping.

As a foodie, I was quite turned off by all the times she described cat hair everywhere in her kitchen and went on about her lack of good housekeeping like it was a badge of honor. Be warned, there is a scene in the book where her kitchen ends up filled with flies and maggots again because of her admitted poor house keeping. Mmmm...doesn't it make you want to go to her house for dinner. Oh well, at least it got her out of her temp job and now it got her a movie deal, so I hope she is at least happier.

432,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",1,Unappetizing on every level,Format: Mass Market Paperback,"This book was revolting. The author, Julie, is revolting. She is so far beyond whiny and self-absorbed that she appears to have some kind of personality disorder. The examples are rampant. She lacks empathy for her husband, her mother, the 911 victim's families, a pinioned lobster struggling to escape (she giggles at it flailing around on her cutting board). What kind of person would set out food for co-workers knowing there may be shards of glass/antifreeze in it? She's crying and hysterical on an almost daily basis or laughing inappropriately. She cooks meals for other people in an apartment she describes in the most disgusting of terms; sludge backing up out of the pipes, cat hair stuck to everything, days of dirty dishes piled in the sink. The place is so filthy that a colony of maggots is breeding under her drain board. Beyond disgusting.

The title leads one to believe this is supposed to be about food/cooking in some way. The actual cooking part (the ""project""), when she bothers to mention it, is so haphazardly portrayed that one comes away with impression that she isn't really trying to learn how to cook at all. Cooking seems besides the point. She isn't gaining anything either insightful or educational from the experience. Rather, she's using the ""project"" as a way to legitimize and aggrandize her appalling behavior. At the end of the book she's a gloating, narcissistic twit, no different than how she started.

I can only hope that she was wildly exaggerating all of it in some misguided attempt to be funny. If she wasn't, she really needs to get help.

Warning: you have to be in a generous state of mind though!,Format: Hardcover,"As you may know already, this is the story of a 30-year-old secretary who decided to embark on making all the recipes in Julia Child's seminal cookbook in a year. There's a lot of (and I mean A LOT!) drama in the book with the author's job, cooking project and other interpersonal relationships, and I'm not sure that it's the good kind of drama.

It's kind of fun to read about her cooking experiences, but the author's style is very erratic and almost ADD-like, which makes it very hard to follow. You have to be in a generous state of mind to finish and maybe enjoy this book (which I was). I have to agree with other reviewers that in the end, this is a pretty self-absorbed book about Julie's cooking project and life, reminiscent of another surprising hit ""Eat, Pray, Love"".

I never got overly bored with it, and hence, finished it in a few sittings. However, being a young working woman myself, I felt like this memoir was closer in substance to a conversation that I might have at the bar after three martinis with a good friend than publishable material. While I really enjoy good, if somewhat trite conversation with close friends over martinis, I don't enjoy plopping down cash for it, unless that cash is for said drinks. This work very much needed an editor, as I found it hard to believe that the author was thirty years old, and not something much closer to my own age of twenty-three (but I guess it just goes to show that age is nothign but a number.)

I was advised often in writing classes in college to keep a journal as a method of finding my own voice - with the instruction to read it over again at a later date and critique. Ms. Powell's book has all of the markings of a writer who takes no time for objective critiquing of their own work. What may have seemed at the time to be witty or cute or, in the case of her tantrums, completely justifiable, may come off to the general public as childish and crass. When we write about our selves, we must be very careful to edit for these reasons, and while most of the time it is fine to not care what the general public thinks, it's very important to care when one is writing for them.

438,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",1,Fact? Fiction? Who Cares?,Format: Mass Market Paperback,"Here we have yet another “memoir” of a well-educated, narcissistic woman, who moves to New York and can’t understand why she’s pressing 30 and the world has not yet handed her adoration on a silver platter. If you like Lena Dunham’s “girls,” you’ll love this book.

My biggest problem with this book is the reason “memoir” is in quotation marks. She admits up front that not everything in the book is true. So why not write it as a novel? Readers approach fiction and non-fiction differently, and judge them by different standards. In a novel, lack of credibility is a serious fault. Truth, however, can indeed be stranger than fiction, and a non-fiction work thus cannot be criticized for lack of credibility. For example, a true story of “how I met Ernest Hemmingway and changed his life” is well worth reading. As fiction, it is just silly. By writing semi-fiction as a memoir, the author is, literally, taking advantage of our trust.

So we wade through the stories of the author and her (Fictional? Who knows?) girlfriends, their relationships, their boyfriends, their general cluelessness, their overwhelming incompetence, their impulsiveness, their anxieties, their self-obsession, their mysterious medical problems, their mothers, and all the rest of it. In this it is exactly like countless other recent semi-fictional memoirs of overprivileged women who think the world owns them not merely a living, but fame. Downright cruel, however, is her portrayal of her husband. He is either a saint, a masochist, or a man with serious self-esteem problems. Run, Eric, run! You seem like a decent guy. You may yet find a mate who loves you at least half as much as she loves herself.

Of course, it is the cooking that makes this book different from the hundreds of similar tales. But Julie doesn’t really seem to enjoy cooking, or even eating. She gives gruesome descriptions of her every failure; of the successes she can hardly manage more than “delicious.” It is a cooking obsession that drives her, almost like a mental illness, and if it hurts her so much, I wish she would just stop. (In this she reminded me of hoarders.) According to the author, she frequently does stunningly stupid things in the kitchen--- like starting to cook a dish and realize halfway through that she doesn’t have a key ingredient, or cooking without reading the recipe all the way first. Is that funny? Maybe the first time. Is it true? I suspect not. After a while, you wonder (supposing it is true!) how anyone that dim could have graduated from Amherst (see Wikipedia). The author has to learn that stupid is more often tedious than funny.

I can see why Julia Child refused to meet this woman. In her cooking adventures, it is often perfectly clear that for Julie to have made this big a mess, the recipe itself must have been at fault. (For example, marinating lamb for 5 days at room temperature. Is that really what the recipe says to do?) As Mrs. Child was famous for testing her recipes to the point of obsession, this is a pretty serious slur to throw at a very distinguished cooking expert. Or is this one of the author’s unlabeled fictions?

Inexplicably, the book is interspersed with occasional pages on the life of Julia Child and her husband Paul. Does the reader know that these “first person” accounts are fiction? As biography, they would be interesting. As the product of Julie Powell’s imagination, they are worthless.

To paraphrase John Ruskin, she has thrown a mess, not only in the kitchen, but in the public’s face.",One person found this helpful,0

Anyway, over the weekend I saw this book at Wal-Mart and picked it up thinking it would be good. The cover shows a lovely picture of Merle as Julia and the actress who plays the author Julie in the movie. A lovely cover that does not reflect the content of this book I am sorry I spent the money and wish I had not because part of that will go to the author and I would prefer not to support or encourage her.

Let me explain why I have such strong feelings about this, I am an avid reader, always reading and looking for interesting books...

I find the author who does not mind letting you know she does not believe in God using His name constantly in her writing as a curse, this is offensive and I finally took a pen to begin blocking out all the instances. Since she also admittedly ""curses like a sailor"" a trait she gets from her mom, I also ended up blacking out all the ""F"" words that took a lot of ink. I kept expecting there to be some redeeming value in this Best Seller, something but unfortunately, at the end there is not.

This is the story of a woman and her husband who both have has a problem with alcohol, they drink excessively not just a drink every day but drunk and hung over more than is natural or normal.

1. She is a secretary and she uses the word and the description of her job as a put-down, after all, she drinks and has all these issues because she is a secretary so she is trying to find a way to make a buck and get out of this terrible job.

2. She works in a state agency in NY that she does not identify I understand if I were that agency, I would not want to be associated with someone who makes fun of and ridicules my clients. She takes messages and phone calls from people who suggest ideas for the memorial from 9-11. Which she also ridicules, the office is right next to the hole, and she has to help with Family Day...what a bother all those crying people.

3. She may be working with great menus from a famous cookbook but from the descriptions, her kitchen is disgusting, cat hair, dried food, and filth everywhere and there are several days where she does not shower, figure in the hangovers and general filth she lives in and it is disgusting.

4. Oh and how does she get the cookbook she decides to try to make something out of, she steals her mom's book. Mom has had and used this book for 40 years and while she is home, she sneaks it into her suitcase, what a kid.

5. However, she is not a kid she is 29 going on 30 while writing this blog and cooking so she is old enough to understand how to write a blog but not mature enough to leave out the cursing even when her bloggers ask her to lighten up and then she puts all that nasty language in this book.

6. She also like to poke fun at the people in the agency she works for because they take their work seriously, because she is neither wise nor dedicated and admittedly takes the job just to have one. She wanted to be an actress but did not like to go to casing calls so consequently did not get any jobs.

7. She also makes several disturbing references about shooting people in power, either herself or her brother.

8. The author ridicules other Christian beliefs as well as normal American concepts because she is so above the need for moral guidelines with her own beliefs, which are not existent.

9. This book is being recommended for reading groups and has discussion questions in the back, before your Christian Book Club mistakenly picks this one you may want to discuss if it is worth wading through all the filth, especially the disturbing and constant use of God's name in vain.

I would be happy to lend my copy to anyone, usually I pass books along to my daughters or donate them, but I do not want to inflict this on anyone who is not interested and for the same reason do not want anyone to spend money that will encourage this type of trash writing. I enjoy good books; this is just obviously not good literature and not worth spending money on.

I expected some amount of editorializing about topics unrelated to cooking/food as the book is an offshoot of the author's blogging experience, after all. However, her condescending and unsympathetic tone toward anyone who does not share her personal worldview, political stance, or dress sense was extremely off-putting; and while I am not the most reverent person myself, I found a lot of the narrative to be excessively crass.
____All that said, the biggest problem this story has is that the protagonist is not terribly relatable( okay I know it's nonfiction, but still). Sure lots of us have tedious jobs, are less than tidy, make ghastly mistakes in recipes, and have occasional hissy fits; but this gal takes it all to the extreme. The sarcasm and bitterness about her ""government drone"" job are unpleasant. Her descriptions of her housekeeping (or lack thereof) are pretty horrifying.

Everyone makes cooking or baking mistakes at some point, but the sheer number of times this author has problems because SHE DIDN'T BOTHER READING THROUGH THE FLIPPIN' RECIPE FIRST is incredibly annoying. Then, on top of all this, she is constantly whingeing and moaning about one or another of the aforementioned issues...either that or totally freaking out and getting hysterical.

There was not enough time in the day for her to have held down a full time job, as dead ended as it was, to have pounded out on her computer's keyboard a daily blog, as self-centered as it was, and to have slopped her way through the preparation of an evening meal, much less to have conquered from cover to cover every nuance of Julia Child's brilliantly written Mastering the Art of French Cooking. But let's assume for a moment that one of the maggots that she tells us inhabited her kitchen, morphed into a talented sous-chef and took over the cooking chores, leaving Ms. Powell free to soak herself in her beloved nightly vodka. That still would not have left her with sufficient time to shop for all the necessary ingredients called for by Julia's recipes. And how in the world did she pay for them, given the meager income about which she whines and whines? And from whence came the money to buy all the pots and pans, a food processor, and other culinary accoutrements, necessary to accomplish her ridiculously conceived and poorly undertaken goal of trying to emulate the great Julia Child? The entire scheme is a farce. If you are enthralled by someone using the F word over and over and over, ad infinitum, in referring to everyone and everything that irritates her, and in this book that includes everything from her job, to her husband, to her apartment, to her friends, whom she reviles, to every Republican she has ever met or heard of, to the victims of September 11, then this is your book.

She isn't. The problem is the content. After reading the first 90 pages, I put the book down, finally admitting to myself that I really didn't care what Ms. Powell thought or opined about anything. I was finding her blog-turned-book to be just one more rant from a neurotic New Yorker, a genre for which my tolerance peaked several years ago. It was never that high to begin with.

Unfortunately, a friend had given me the book, thinking I'd enjoy it because of my fondness for Julia Child. Maybe that contributed to my reaction to the author. Juxtaposing herself with Julia Child invites one to think about issues of character, style and substance. On all those measures, Ms. Powell suffers.

However, I'm not sure even the divine Ms. Streep or the inimitable Ms. Ephron can make me see this one. I really wanted this book to be one of those that simply makes the character (in this case, also the writer) so dear to you, you're sorry the book ends. I wanted to share it with girlfriends and have it return dog-eared and worn, while we laughed and talked over crepes about the parts we liked best, how it must feel to kill lobsters or extract bone marrow or clean kidneys! None of this happened. In fact, it left me feeling a little ""dark,"" and not at all cheerful. A few reasons:

I must say, like some of Julie's ""bleaders,"" (and as a mother of four 20-somethings!) I quickly grow intolerant of the ""F"" word. There are moments when its placement is strikingly funny, or surprising, or in some way redeemable. Its overuse just smacks of someone with a limited vocabulary.

Unbelievably tiresome were the relentless digs at Republicans. I grew resentful very quickly, and I'm not a Republican!!! Some of the references to 9/11 families were callous.

The parts of the book that dealt with cooking, with food, with the search for ingredients, was somewhat interesting, and sometimes funny and entertaining. It really did make me want to get a copy of MtAoFC, and that's a good thing, I suppose. It didn't, however, make me want to cook my way through it!!!

While realizing that Julie Powell was not a professional writer at the time she began the Project (and in fairness, I never read the blog), perhaps she did not foresee the success of the blog, the book, or the movie. What I do appreciate is that she did not attempt to portray herself in a positive light, but rather, it seems, simply said, ""what you read is what you get.""

Not serious. Not professional. Disrespectful. Since Julia at that time before she died had sixty more years of wisdom under her belt than Julie, I'll go with Child.

454,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",2,It's not what it could have been.,Format: Hardcover,"Just before a quick trip to France I plucked the abridged audio book of Julie & Julia off my desk and tossed it into my carry-on bag. It seemed fitting to listen to a book about Julia Child and her book, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, while winging my way to France.

Since I'd heard a great deal about the book, I later read the actual book to compare it to the abridged audio version.

The author reads the audio book and does a brilliant job. As someone who dislikes anything and everything about cooking, I admired her perseverance in tackling such a huge project in one year.

Powell writes in a manner that could be termed a quirky stream of consciousness that is interesting and often quite funny. Generally I enjoyed her offbeat writing and the people that make up the landscape of her life. At other times I found her coarse, juvenile, whiny and disrespectful in a way that wasn't at all funny. It was trite and disrespectful and made her look uncaring.

I found her generalization and stereotyping of Republicans as evil people, sad yet interesting, since Democrats call for the acceptance of diverse beliefs. Apparently that only goes for them and not others. As a Kennedy Democrat of yesteryear I was embarrassed. Somehow the title didn't fit Powell's banal rants. Her language certainly was surprising. And then there were the 9/11 references. I wanted to discontinue at that point. Her disdain for the victims families, well, I have no words to adequately express my feelings.

That said, Powell exhibits talent and is free to express her beliefs. I hope she puts it to better use in her next outing. Perhaps she'll grow up a bit, and latch on to some wisdom before then. I hope so because she has a gift that needs some fine-tuning and direction. If she doesn't, she might find that she's lost fifty percent of her audience. Maybe more if you include the older folks of similar political leanings.

459,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",1,Yet more glorification of the clueless...,Format: Hardcover,"So, the premise is promising: Bored temp secretary strives to reinvigorate herself with the ambitious project of cooking all the recipes from Vol. 1 of Julia Child's landmark work in just one year. Unfortunately, the product buries the promise under a stinking pile of hysteria and pseudo-intellectual (and inappropriate) navel-gazing.

Overall, my impression of this book are similar to the other 1-star reviews here. The author's persona in this book is that of a witless and spoiled child who feels entitled to whatever ""good life"" she imagines for herself. A better example of a Gen-Y stereotype I've never seen. So, as a Gen-X reader, I find myself disliking her intensely and even silently cheering when yet another recipe goes awry. (I mean, come on -- a simple icing fails because she fails to grok the rather pointed instructions telling her to use separate bowls for the eggs? Seriously?)

After I finished reading this book, I couldn't help wondering if anything could have saved the author some serious pain and anguish (and thereby return the story to some semblance of coherence). Actually, there are two words that would have either brought this book to a screeching halt or turned it into a much more rewarding read: Alton Brown (a real admirer of Julia Child, btw).

Yes, friends, this book might possibly be very different had the author had the presence of mind to actually inform herself of some really basic cooking principles before attempting some of those classic French gems. All she had to do was page through ""I'm Just Here for the Food"" a few times and she would have been golden. I mean, who ventures into tricky territory without at least a bloody guidebook? But no, she maintains complete ignorance and puts everyone in her world through a Very Special Hell, the result of which is a glorification of idiocy as disgusting as her cat-hair-and-maggot-ridden kitchen. I thought I would be happy to see this book end, but again, the ending is as unsatisfying as the preceding pages. Because the book tries to end about 3 times before it just simply stops. Neil Gaiman and Anne Rice might be able to get away with that -- this girl, not so much.

So, don't get this book because you want to read about food or Julia Child or one woman's ""unique"" interpretation of Julia Child's stuff. Get this book because you love to see an unbearably entitled and clueless ne'er-do-well go down in a spectacular show of flames, again and again.

I started reading it recently, got bored, then rented the movie, then went back to the book. The movie is really cute. I didnt even know that was Amy Adams playing Julie! I didnt recognize her. Meryl Streep, perfect as always. Ok so a great, cute movie. The book is totally different though. Julie Powell is no sweet Amy Adams.

Lots of sexual references and I'm not shocked at all that her new book Cleaving is about her having an affair and her getting into S&M.

The description of her messy apartment, and then the maggots on the dish drainer...ugh. I would NEVER eat or cook in such an environment. Just disgusting beyond reason. Like french dishes arent nasty enough, throw some maggots next to it because she's such a bad housekeeper. Yuck. She's lucky that her blog got the attention and opened the doors that it did. I dont think the same would happen now since everyone and their grandmother has a blog (I still write in diaries myself, I dont understand one airing their private thoughts onto the internet for all to see).

463,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",3,A fun but flawed read for foodies & Juliacs,Format: Hardcover,"As another serious home cook who learned by making his way through Mastering the Art of French Cooking, I was eager to read this chronicle of a fellow Julia student. While I found it an entertaining read, the book has some serious flaws.

First, the good: the most successful parts are the accounts of the actual cooking sessions. Her vividly recalled failures and frustrations in the kitchen are often hilarious and will resonate with anyone who has attempted to cook an ambitious menu. Her singular passion to accomplish her goal makes you root for her; when she does triumph -- both along the way in individual recipes and at the very end by making the deadline -- it's satisfying and poignant.

What isn't sucessful are the bits added post-blog (and since I did not follow the project as it unveiled on her blog, I read the book as a newbie with no bias toward the original account). The imagined courtship between Julia and her husband Paul Child simply doesn't work. For one thing, these brief, italicized interludes are repetitive and don't really go anywhere or add up to anything. Nor do they reveal anything new about the couple's relationship that you couldn't glean from any of Julia's biographies. I assume the reason the Julia/Paul interludes are there is to show both Julie and Julia at the moments in their lives when they are both seeking the ""Project"" that will give meaning to their lives. It's interesting that cooking was the instrument of change in both their lives, but so what? -- that's true of many people, and hardly something that Powell and Child alone share. We already know the story about Julia & Paul's courtship so why cover that ground? (And even if you don't know about it, as Powell presents it it's not very interesting.) The passages feel randomly placed and intrusive; they're jarring in the way they steal you out of Julie's intense hot and bothered outerborough kitchen and thrust you into some stagy A&E Biography-like ""real-life reenactment"" that feels false and ""literary."" Their cool, sepia tone is also at odds with Powell's own marvelous salty, smart-ass voice. (It's not a pleasing contrast.) What would have been more original and also more challenging and revealing (of both Julias) would have been for Powell to imaginatively chronicle Julia Child's own progress in the kitchen -- show us how Julia learned how to carve a duck and how she felt during her own apprentice days about killing a live lobster, etc. That would at least have parallelled what Powell was going through, and would have gotten inside Julia's head in an interesting way. As it is, the Julia/Paul interludes feel tacked on, feel like padding. Some of the passages about Powell's friends and family and coworkers also have a tangential quality that dilutes the primary relationship here, which is Julie/Julia -- not Julia/Paul or even Julie/husband.

I suspect that Powell's editors are to blame for these ""enhancements"" to the blog material. I hope she'll have the clout and courage to follow her own voice next time around.",10 people found this helpful,0

I think there is a market today for food writing; good food writing, like MFK Fisher and Elizabeth David, but I don't think Julie Powell even comes close. The Julie/Julia Project is a front for this young novelist who see-saws between charming and extremely annoying in her attempts to describe how her life evolves over a one-year period in which she participated (to whatever extent) in some very profound experiences, like working for the government agency dealing with the World Trade Center memorials, a household move in NYC, dealing with a less than stellar marraige, and coping with very needy friends and family.

Julie, get a get a grip on your neurosis and narcissism and just write! Forget the food, it's just not you.

I am certain that seeing these people cry and put up letters and pictures on the wall would be life altering for me. It doesn't affect her.

The book has nothing to do with cooking, from a woman who seemingly hates food and only started cooking(by her on account) to snag her husband. Why I wonder did the woman choose to do all of the recipes in MTAOFC in 365 instead of truly trying to do the recipes as written and to perfection? I do think as a past reviewer has said that this was Ms. Powell attempt( which she did successfully) to get rich off of the late and great Julia Child.

I am not a fan of reading about a very spoiled woman who seems to have no real talent of her own. Complaining about living conditions, family, friends, job, etc. but never seeking to improve them. If you like to read this sort of thing, this is the book for you.",10 people found this helpful,0

474,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",2,"Like mediocre French food, it's not worth your time.",Format: Hardcover,"I picked this up at the library after hearing from a family member that she really enjoyed the movie. Being someone who is skeptical of movie adaptations of books, I figured I had better read the original first. Actually, that's incorrect; if I wanted to read the original, I would have read her blog. Red flag #1: books based on blogs. This should have prepared me for the self-centered, arrogant, whiny-ness to come.

For the record, I love food and reading about food, and I hate chick lit. What I hate even more than chick lit is chick lit disguised as food writing, which is just a travesty. Guess which category ""Julie & Julia"" falls into. The premise of ""Julie & Julia"" is a 29-year old secretary in a dead-end job realizing she has accomplished nothing in her life, and so she takes on the task of cooking her way through ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" in a year. Chapters are interspersed with fictionalized vignettes about Paul Child and how he met Julia, but these are written so amateurishly that they add nothing to the book; they probably even knocked it down a notch in my opinion. What it's really about is Julie Powell whining (and whining, and whining...) about her crappy government agency job, throwing fits of hysteria over pretty much everything, crying, swearing at her husband, and going into tangents about her friends' boyfriends and sexual escapades. It makes you wonder if she hasn't got some kind of bipolar disorder to go along with her hormonal ""syndrome."" Every once in a while, we're treated to a nugget about actual cooking, usually when she fails to do something correctly (cue the screaming and crying). She deliberately paints this unpleasant picture of herself, but there's self-degrading (which can be charming and funny; see: Tina Fey), and then there's just pathetic. So many times I wanted to grab her by the shoulders, slap her across the face, and yell, ""GROW THE F*** UP.""

I have to admit, I enjoyed this all in the beginning, and was able to get through the book pretty quickly, but by the end I was groaning at Julie's tiresome immaturity, culinary ineptitude, anger-management issues, and above all, her being rewarded for all of it with a cushy book deal. And there lies the biggest problem I have with this book: a blogger does not a writer make. I mean, it's a pretty bad sign when the author can't even explain why she started ""The Project"" in the first place. After recently reading ""Heat,"" a food memoir which was not only ABOUT FOOD (whaddya know!) but also humorous and insightful, ""Julie & Julia"" just couldn't compete. What's worse is the end chapter, ""Cleaving,"" which is included in later editions of the book. I'll sum it up for you: it's a few years later and the same narcissistic Julie, but now she works at a butcher shop, still thinks she's some kind of renegade bad-ass (I literally rolled my eyes when she made a point of saying her iPod was ""blaring Modest Mouse"". We get it. You're hip. Now get over yourself, already.), and tries to muse poetically about life or serenity or inner peace -- I don't remember, my eyes were glazing over at this point-- all the while covered in blood and beef liver. It fails to tie up any loose ends (and actually manages to introduce a few more) or offer any more insight to the book or redeem her unsympathetic character. I strongly urge you to pretend these last few pages don't exist. (EDIT: I found out later that this was an excerpt from Powell's newest book, ""Cleaving"")

All in all, Powell tries to sell us something mundane (her boring life) by spicing it up a little (the ""Project"") and distracting us with some fancy sauce (over-writing, a tendency to fall flat when waxing philophical, and liberal swearing), but unfortunately it all comes together about as well as her poached eggs in aspic.",6 people found this helpful,0

You don't eat Cheetos again for a long time. This book is like that---it's junk food, not worth the ten bucks.
Better to spend the money on the film (""Julie and Julia"") that is partially based on the book---you'll get the idea and you'll get to watch Amy Adams and (especially) Meryl Streep.

On second thought, maybe an analogy between Julie Powell's chronicle of her attention-getting stunt and useless junk food does not quite get at the ""bad for you"" quality of ""Julie and Julia."" The truly unfortunate thing about this book, in which Julie the blogger cooks her way through Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking,"" is the false impression it gives of Child's great cookbook, which taught me, and so many others, how to cook. Certainly some of the recipes in ""Mastering"" are complicated and even fussy, but the majority are not; they're just good and exceptionally well-written, half a century after Julia Child set out to make French food accessible for American cooks. Julie Powell, however, emphasizes the really complicated recipes (and resulting mishaps)---that's what sells books--and her kitchen catastrophes ultimately give a downright misleading impression of what Julia Child was all about, which was encouraging people to think that they too could cook delicious food. Forego the book for the movie, but take the ten bucks you would have spent on ""Julie and Julia"" and put them toward the ingredients for Julia Child's duckling with orange sauce or her chicken fricassee or her creme caramel. Make yourself a feast. Hate cooking? Then skip ""Julie and Julia"" and buy the wonderful Julia Child memoir, ""My Life in France.""",10 people found this helpful,0

Having not seen the movie, I asked my mother if Amy Adams portrayed her as a foul-mouth, whiny person. Apparently, she did not. While I was not expecting a perky little house frau, I did hope that the author would have some redeeming qualities. For example, she is endlessly mean to her husband, passes judgement on all of her friends and collegues and gives intimate details of their sexual exploits,and even though I am a Democrat myself, I find her continual jabs at the Republicans she works with incredibly disrespectful. All this relates to Julia Child how? I'm still not sure. I am no prude and believe me I have had go arounds with my husband, cursed, and have been judgmental. I just don't feel the need to write any of my personal issues in a book. However, she swears like a truck driver and drinks to the point where she ruins some dishes. If that's what you are doing at 29 years old, perhaps lack of culinary expertise is the least of your issues. That and maybe her lack of heart in dealing with the families of 9/11 victims because she didn't like her job. A real stand up gal!

I hoped this would be more of homage to Julia Child. I own both volumes of Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Both were my Grandmother's. We used to watch the show together on PBS back in the 70's. I felt like Julia was an after thought and it was only towards the end where her significance is truly addressed. I felt that there was not really a great love for this culinary icon so much as she was a means to an end. I guess I was hoping this would be about love of food and a passion for cooking and a tip of the sauce pan to a great legend of the kitchen. Instead, I found it self-indulgent and insufferable. It's much more of a complaint about how awful she precieves her life to be instead of a great chance to really honor an outstanding woman.

I thought many parts were laugh-out-loud funny and her use of obscenities I found quite natural, not at all forced, and I took no offense. I felt a bit squicked out with some of the sexual references but only because it was a work of fact, not fiction, and I don't really want to know these things about an author when he or she is writing in the first person. I also became quickly annoyed with the constant quirkiness of her friends and her brother, something that always gets on my pecs.

She reminds me of a child who makes a joke, and then has to repeat it fifteen times, just in case you didn't get it the first time.

I enjoy the chatty writing style of the author and find her anecdotes about life's little moments laugh-out-loud funny at times and that's what keeps me interested. But i can't overlook the contempt in her tone for 9/11 families and her frequent peppering of ethnic reference and attribution throughout the book. At one point she refers to Hindu mechanics: FOLKS, LISTEN UP, Hinduism is a religion, not a race. There is nothing that typically would visually distinguish a Hindu from, for example, a Christian. So I'm assuming she was making assumptions based on skin color and that's just stupid and ignorant in this post-9/11 world. Ultimately she's just misinformed in her warped wittiness. At another point, she refers to Japanese sex practices. It's a gratuitous device designed for laughs I suppose, but ultimately it falls flat and comes off as insensitive and immature, especially once this device is applied a little too often.

I'm not sure why the editors didn't catch some of this stuff that borders on offensive but that just goes to underscore how instutionalized racism is: we accept it to a point where so many of us don't even notice it for what it is, especially when the product is packaged with the clever hipness of a blog association.

As I said earlier, I have been enjoying the light reading that it is, and therein is my confict because I do find some of the material offensive and tacky. Sloppy editing at the very least, I'd say.

I'm guessing the blog was more on point in regards to the actual recipes and the experience of making each one, so I find myself wishing more to have read that since I bought the book thinking I would get to read the contents of what sounded like a smart and entertaining culinary adventure.

She's not even smart enough to make an attempt to not alienate a large portion of readers.Oh wait, that's right Republicans dont read and if they did they certaintly would not read a book about cooking or Julia Child because they are too busy eating their young.

The writing is very poor. She doesn't even make the food sound good, which was so disappointing in a book about cooking Julia Child's recipes. I was so tired of all the COMPLAINING. She complains about her job, her apartment, her friends, her move, her husband, and what's up with all the profanity? I wanted to yell ""grow up!"" half the time I was reading it. Sometimes complaining is okay - like when it's funny; comedians have made quite a living with that, but hers isn't funny, it's just annoying.

I was so bothered by the way she treated her husband when he was having a migraine - absolutely deplorable. It's terrible that she did it, but then to write about it shows her to be selfish and narcissistic.

The last thing I'll mention are the numerous war references she uses, the one that sticks out the most is when she refers to the mess in her apartment as like the Bataan Death March. No, Julie, it wasn't like that. Perhaps you should read up on the terror of that situation and be grateful you weren't a part of it, and be grateful and respectful to those that were.

There was not enough wine to help them through it and yes we do enjoy dark humor.

She is a complete narcissist and lacks any ability to relay a story, even a horrible one. She whines througout the entire book about every single thing in her life. She rambles, complains, curses stupidly and treats her husband Eric like crap non-stop. I often find that when a woman writes a list of reasons why her husband would never leave or cheat on her he usually already has.

The author has nothing but disgust and contempt for New York and real New Yorkers, page 149 ""Yes, New York is a stinking, chaotic, life-sucking cesspool and Austin, Texas, is a verdant, peaceful paradise,..."" one of many insults about this great city. She's a wanna-be New Yorker and overcompensates while still complaining about her endless knowledge of every nook and cranny of the city. Terms like ""Yankee-fied"", ""New York-hardened skin"" phrases are sad. To the rest of us it's just disturbing.

On that note, her complete lack of sympathy or kindness towards the families affected by September 11th (9/11) is reprehensible. She thinks she's funny she's not, she's jut cruel. And I guess she thinks by being the most venemous liberal in LIC it will make her more acceptable. Again, it doesn't, she's just ignorant and small minded.

More french cooking less narcisstic sharing. Our group decided to pass on the movie now. I read a few pages of her next book and it's more of the same garbage only now she's a butcher, what a surpise.

Towards the end of the book she find out from a CA reporter in an interview that Julia Child said she hates Julie Powell and now I find that very understandable.

It's all about Julie and her personal commitment to a goal. Her quest of making 524 Julia Child's recipes in 365 days would never enter the minds of 99.9% of goal setters - including master chefs. However, it is Julie's goal and she does achieve it. She includes friends, family and the world at large making herself vulnerable and allowing them all to observe her either personally or through her daily blog. Somehow, she doesn't say exactly how - she even gets the attention of the media and Julia Child herself.

Her writing reflects the world surrounding her as she often doggedly flails away at each recipe - including her less than desirable government secretarial job, co-workers, home, family, pets, friends, political climate, post 9/11 New York.

I came to know and like Julie and her alter ego, Julia, who comes to exist in Julie's brain. Julie's Julia lives in another time and world. Her Julia is brash, adventuresome, young, healthy and bold.These are all traits Julie displays herself as she goes through this year with a 40-year-old cookbook. She finds Julia and finds herself. She is an explorer/adventurer with the mouth of a sailor. That's okay, because that is Julie and she reveals herself through her honest writing.

Julie endeared herself to me - I am way past thirty years of age - but I can remember the trials and tribulations of being 29 going on 30. You just have to love someone who wears a Madonna bustier/corset to work and then goes home to work barefoot in her little NY kitchen to perform culinary miracles with a calf's brain, butter, cream and wine.

If her mother had not named her Julie or she had not found the confidence to blog, we might have been spared this painfully bad book. I tried to read it, but could barely read the first 100 pages, much less finish it. I wanted to be inspired by Julie's project. I tried to give her a second or third chance, but as a foodie, admirer of Child, and a francophile, this book disappointed me on all fronts. The book was tasteless, bland, and at times nauseating. Is there any humor in 9/11? I think not. Julie's attempt to cook like Julia is as bad as I would imagine it to be if Sarah Palin started to do Tina Fey impersonations.

This book has gotten so much attention because of Julia Child's well-recognized name, which translates into great marketing potential. You don't pay Meryl Streep to star in a film AND have Nora Ephron write the screenplay unless you are sure to make yourself some money. From the reviews I have read, it seemed that Ephron rewrote rather than simply adapted the book. Then I realized that the movie combines ""Julie and Julia"" with Julia Child's well-written and well-received memoir ""My Life in France"". The reviews tell you what a mistake that was. Critics love Meryl as Julia and Stanley Tucci as Paul. On the contrary, even likable, talented Amy Adams can't make Julie a sympathetic character because, frankly, she isn't. One reviewer called Julie's character ""a bitter pill"" and ""a colorless mope"". Whoever had the idea to combine the two books into one movie should be forced to eat bread and water for the rest of his/her miserable life as penance!!! (Is there a Hell in the blogosphere?)

Julia Child's reputation, fortunately, will not suffer due to this insufferable book. On a positive note, ""Julie and Julia"" has inspired me to read ""My Life in France"", mind you, a copy with Julia and Paul on the cover, not the movie tie-in version (see marketing rant above). I am also going to re-open my copy of ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" and make the garlic mashed potatoes. They are simply divine and worth all the effort. My mom and I made them one memorable Thanksgiving.

On a final note, I was appalled to see that Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of ""Eat, Pray, Love"", a fabulous memoir which includes the author eating her way through Italy, contributed a positive blurb on the paperback jacket.

A foul-mouthed, foul-minded, narcissistic, whining American secretary/wife spends one year on French cooking.

The only redeeming points of the book are the occasional interesting metaphor and some information on Julia Child.

Please do not waste your time on this book (and on a different note, add tons of butter to...or ladle over...any dish you make and it will instantly become a ""French"" dish. That is the grand secret to French cooking. French dining calls for a large tub of butter on the table next to the French dish.)",6 people found this helpful,0
571,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",1,Outs her father's ancient affair (that has WHAT to do with cooking?) which tells you every unpleasant thing you need to know.,Format: Mass Market Paperback,"This book has one redeeming feature -- it may lead people to read My Life in France, by Julia Child (and her husband Paul's nephew, Alex Prud'Homme). That is a magnificent book about a very unique person who lived a wonderful, very unusual life. Unless you want to read for yourself how deeply unlovely the real Julie Powell is, skip Julie & Julia and treat yourself at once to the grit and charm of the creative, fun, funny and unflappable Julia Child of My Life in France.

Nora Ephron made a movie based on both books. The near-universal take on the movie is that the parts featuring Julia Child were divine (Meryl Streep is a wonder in it) and the parts featuring Julie Powell were highly irritating. That pretty well sums up the difference between the two books, as well.

I don't enjoy cooking, but love Julia Child, and would have found it very interesting to hear detailed descriptions of someone attempting her recipes. Oddly, Powell gives only the most cursory descriptions of her endeavors, and reuses the same ones repeatedly (I'm guessing she had a macro on her computer for ""cooked it down with some butter and vermouth""). Recipes that would be hard for the average person (I know how to cook, I just don't enjoy it) often get dismissed with the remark ""that was too easy to talk about."" That doesn't ring true, and is ridiculous -- the reader is holding the book precisely because they WANT to hear about it! At first I was quite puzzled by this apparent contradiction. But not that far in, Powell reveals her true purpose in creating ""the project"" -- her wild enthusiasm over her blog hits reveals her ambition that her idea might just garner her her fifteen minutes. Once you understand the real purpose of the book, it all makes so much more sense. (Powell has been quoted as saying ""I think I'm going to get out of the memoir-ing game for a little bit. Two memoirs before the age of 40 is plenty."" I think her use of the word ""game"" is no accident. And while we are discussing games: in my opinion, the maggots were ill-advised fiction.) I came across several reviews suggesting that perhaps Powell did not actually do all that much cooking. That strikes me as a reasonable explanation of why the book lacks focus on and has very little writing about its supposed subject.

Now good books can wander far afield and still be wonderful. This one is not. Powell is that most unfunny of writers, one who is deeply convinced she is hilarious. Similarly, she describes herself as crazy, zany, insane, etc. Once again, to insist you are is generally the surest way to demonstrate that you are not. Powell's writing is deeply tedious. Much has been made of all the cussing. I don't care about cussing one way or the other... to my way of thinking, ""f***ing"" is a fine adjective for everyday use in one's own brain. But in a book, it's just non-descriptive non-writing, and quickly boring. Cussing is like salt -- it's just one of many seasonings, it cannot be the sauce. Her editor would have done well to present Powell with a dictionary and a thesaurus (or just tell her about Google). (I guess someone edited this, although it is clear that the marketing department had the most influence over this attempt.)

I found all the blah blah on her friends' sex lives, her sex life, her body odor and her gynecological syndrome strangely out of place. Powell seems not to grasp that intimate details about a person who is inherently unlikeable, compounded by self-admitted bad hygiene, aren't sexy or intriguing, they're just stomach-turning. What I found outrageous and unforgivable was her revealing to the world that her father had an affair and cheated on her mother when Powell was a child. She even supplies her maiden name, just in case there was any question as to her father's identity. This is so completely irrelevant to the alleged plot (cooking) and the actual plot (ambition) that it stands out as the single-most unflattering thing Powell reveals about herself (and that is really saying something considering the extremely unlovely self-portrait she creates). Why? What is the point of this revelation? In the Acknowledgments, Powell thanks her parents. I'm guessing the feeling is not mutual on this count. Marital infidelity is a terrible, terrible thing. What is Powell's purpose in revealing publicly that wound, especially since her parents apparently worked it out and are still together? Was she trying to excuse her own infidelities, shortly to be revealed in her next book, on the theory that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree? Was she trying to humiliate her mother? Excoriate her father? Confirm our impression that Powell is a toxic person, best avoided?

Powell's way of discussing the families of victims of September 11 is also very disturbing. Grief does strange things to people (as does the quest for fame) but the snide, mean and completely unsympathetic way she talks about some of the (admittedly less-then-felicitous) suggestions for a memorial that come from some of the families have the same effect as so much of her writing on the other irrelevant subjects in this book. It doesn't entertain, it isn't thought-provoking, it isn't clever. Powell's rants simply cement the reader's feeling that Powell is (or at least presents herself to be) a person one should aspire to be very, greatly, hugely, UNlike.

If you want to learn about Julia Child and read a really good book, take yourself to the library and check out My Life in France. If you want to see a very entertaining movie, watch Julie & Julia (and be assured that the ordering of those two names is on the save-the-best-for-last system!). Nora Ephron very wisely watered down Powell as she describes herself, and even the Julie parts of the movie are watchable (hint: prepare yourself for a lot of whining). But I won't be surprised if you do what I did... right after watching the movie all the way through once, I watched it a second time, fast-forwarding through all the non-Julia parts. Fabulous!

Imagine the hoots of derision from Trekkies as Julie described yet another convention without having mastered Klingon. Yes we mock Trekkies, but why? Do they not find enjoyment in life where for us only a hole exists? Now ask yourself why food indulgence legitamises life more than indulgence in science fiction. Once you've answered that, you begin to realise that J&J is one woman's account of her dislocation from a society where life has no real meaning beyond the endless pursuit of indulgence and where, for some, food has become a religion. And by religion I don't just mean 'passion', I mean 'that without which, for some, life would be meaningless'.

While I've been disheartened with the overwhelming crop of boring memoirs based on a simple, NPR-ish premise (""All my Life for Sale"" for instance), to this book, I thought I could relate. I was wrong. My first clue should have been in the bookstore, when I flipped to a few ""sample"" pages and found the text unrelated to food, or even the Julia project. As I started reading, I found this crawling memoir focuses on the mundane daily details of the life of an uninsightful 29-year-old who just happens to try this weird blog thing her husband puts her up to (which eventually leads to this book). When Julie has trouble poaching an egg in wine, missing are any details related to the food itself (did she spin the wine? use vinegar? what utencil did she use to remove the egg?). Rather, what the reader gets is an account of Julie's freakout, and how her husband came to comfort her (complete with details on the comforting thing he said, and how that comforting thing originally came from a movie). After the first few chapters I found myself skipping these parts, then found that most of the book is about Julie's typical little life. She does not learn anything or grow from the project (other than getting a book deal - how's that for life direction?), nor is the project ever really explained in detail. I kept wondering, ""What order is she going in, if any?"" ""How far along is she?""

Worse if possible. I finally put it down forever about 5 chapters from the end. I just couldn't take any more.

I WANTED to like this book. I was excited to have it to read. I was CERTAIN I'd like it. The whole premise - cooking every recipe in The Modern Art of French Cooking in one year - what a cool idea! What a great memoir it should be!

The problem is - the book is about 30% cooking (and not even cooking well; mostly she subbed and shortcutted her way through it), and the rest a whiney, B****y rant by a spoiled rotten, self-centered, snotty little brat. Her constant snarking about Republicans - and not even a clever, witty snark, just ignorant, lame insults - were really, really annoying. I have no real love for Republicans either, but I don't lump them all together and tar them with feathers for simply existing the way she does.

I hate the way she treats and talks to her husband, I really didn't need to or want to know about her youthful experiences with her parents copy of The Joy of Sex (what the H*** does that have to do with Julia Child???) or her friends sex lives (again - that has what to do with the subject at hand?). And I really, really, REALLY hated her for her gross insensitivity toward the families of the 9/11 victims. Maybe she thought those insensitive things; fine, we all think mean things. But you don't write them down and put them out there for all the world to see and think you are some font of cleverness for it, because you aren't - you are just insensitive and mean.

What's worse than the 70% of the book completely related to her and her alone, is that the cooking-experience-part (which was SUPPOSED to be the main thrust of the book, but wasn't) was so unsatisfying. I admit, a few times she TRIED to make a recipe as written. But a lot of times she just skipped parts or subbed or whatever. Isn't this experience supposed to be trying to cook all of those recipes, as written? Why was that less than half the book and couldn't she have put a bit more effort into it? I was impressed she tried to make her own gelatin. That was cool to read. But those tiny snippets of interesting commentary were so few and far between that it drove me crazy.

Upon reflection, I think this book depends entirely on whether or not you LIKE this woman. If you like her, you will like the book. If you don't like her, you will hate it.

Instead, I recommend My Life in France or any of Julia Child's other books. There, you find an authentic, unpretentious person with a true passion for food and life.

We are close in age and background, similar in work history, and both enjoy good food, good drinks, cursing and leaving the cleaning to someone else.

After reading this book, if someone were to tell me I reminded them of Julie Powell, I would commit hari-kari. She is terribly unpleasant, self-absorbed and repellant. All of the characteristics with which I could identify are completely reduced to rubble in her hands. I find myself never wanting to hear or use the F-word ever again, and even I was repulsed by her disgusting apartment. I had to skip most of the passage involving maggots lest I lose my lunch. All the tales of sticky cat hair, brackish flooded fixtures and rotting floors didn't help either. I read most of the book with that look on my face people have when something nearby stinks.

I assume she was attempting humor and exaggerating many of her misadventures and personality flaws, but the end result is that I loathe her as a fellow human being and wish ill upon her. Her heartless exposure of her friends' and family's personal lives is inexcusable (and dull) and her husband appears to be a combination saint/fool for putting up with her. Powell hates the project, hates her job, dislikes her husband (she mentions her frequent desire to beat his head with sharp rocks. I mean really! Eric! Run for your life!), disdains her friends, scorns her mother, disrespects Julia Child and admires only her cats and her brother.

In its relentlessly bleak tone and insistence on examining the lives of detestable characters, this book reminds me of A Confederacy of Dunces. Another supreme waste of time and positive energy.

It's rather shameful that this author would use the good name of Julia Child to hock her soon-to-be-forgotten book. And even more shameful are those who bought it. But, as P.T.Barnum might have said: there's a sucker born every minute. BTW for those who are wondering, I didn't buy the book. I saw it at a bookstore, sat and skimmed through and then put it back on the shelf. Among my collection of cookbooks are every one Julia Child has written or co-authored. I'd read any one of them again before delving into this one. Unlike Ms. Powell I have cooked my way through volumes 1 and 2 of ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" and it ain't an easy task ... and in a small kitchen in a small apartment in Chelsea (NYC). Some recipes I've done over two or three times just to get them right ... I seriously doubt if Ms. Powell did. BUT what a wonderful conceit to sell a book!

Oh, do see the film if you haven't already. It's wonderful not because of the sections on Ms. Powell's troubles but because of the information received of Julia Child's life that many may not be aware of. And that information is important when comparing the two -- Julia and Julie. Julia Child spent much of her lifetime mastering the art of French Cooking (It can't be done in a day, week or year -- just how long did it take her to perfect a good recipe for French Bread? Two years? And then sadly you realize that the recognition, fame and fortune that took one woman, Julia Child, years to obtain was handed, so to speak, to Ms. Powell on a silver platter. Again, I say shameful.",19 people found this helpful,0

704,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",2,Not what was expected!,Format: Hardcover,"Thinking this would be fascinating read based on premise of cooking through Julia Child's French cookbook sent me into this with hope. Quickly let down when one finds more pages about sex, politics and friends, then about cooking. To some this is better than gourmet cooking experiences.

For example, what a neat entry it might have been to describe more the innovative spit arrangement she came up with which doesn't get much more than small paragraph compared to page after page rambling about her friends' love lives and political spewing about memorial opinions.

Reichl's book ""Comfort Me with Apples"" doesn't even come close to this discomfort, yet she describes sex life and life situations more discreetly and in better prose than sprinkling the f***'s and apparent disinterest really in gaining cooking acumen. Ruhlman's book on making and soul of chef are clear, poignant examples of more of what I was attracted to this title and supposed storyline. If told what this review points out are the emphases, would not have read. So be warned. Any wonder Julia comments so?",85 people found this helpful,0
705,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen",1,Not good. Many mistakes were made,Format: Hardcover,"I'm going to try to be as objective as possible since I was an editor for many years and would like to voice what I think the actual issues with the book are. Starting with the title: Julie and Julia, 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen. This, to me says funny, light-hearted adventures in cooking ala the comedic genius of Julia Child. Not so. It's more of a memoir that is a bit dark at times. The title, I feel, misrepresents the content but this is only minor. The book jacket was extremely well done and actually reminded me of the first episode on the Julia Child French Chef DVD where she tries to use ""conviction"" to flip potatoes in the pan and a big hunk lands on the stove and she declares ""well, that didn't go so well!"" Hilarious stuff and she wasn't even trying to be funny.

Next, the author's opinions about republicans, the president, 9/11 victims etc... I don't have any objection to anyone having strong opinions. Many times, if something is controversial, it actually helps a book sell more copies and is often exactly what a publisher might have in mind right from the start. Where this fails is in the frequency of the remarks. Exhausting. Really good authors need only to mention something once to get a point across. In this case, anyone who is buying a book about someone as significant as Julia Child is likely part of a demographic that is educated and sharp enough to understand the author's position in one go. It was a bit in your face at times. And though the author may have been honest about her feelings with regard to 9/11 families, victims et al., there seemed to be a lack of general humanity in the tone of it - not that she actually felt a certain way but how she put it out for the world to read. The issue here in my opinion (and her editors should really take responsibility for this) is that anyone's first book is critical to that author's ability to make an impression and gain a reputation - one that will help push a career forward. You don't want to insult any group of people your first time around the block. Successful opinion-giving comes with getting your readers to trust and respect your opinions before hitting the sensitive areas. Everything is about timing. You can say anything and get away with it if you give it the proper placement. What all good authors want (and need) is to reach a wide audience particularly on the first go. You want to appeal to a variety of people unless you are writing a high tech book about some new technology/product/whatever that only affects a niche. And really good readers - the caliber of what any author would want - remember these critical first books and the impressions made. I'm guessing that there's the possiblility that the publisher pushed this through the system before it was ready to go in order to get it on the market in time for the gift-giving season. But I think a disservice was done to the author because it really needed a bit more work. She wasn't a trained, practiced writer. She could have used more time and assistance but, sadly, editorial help is no longer what it used to be. Anyway, specific examples include the beginning of the book. All of the gynecological stuff might have been better later in the book. The first few pages of the book seemed to be a forced reproduction of the first few pages in the Devil Wears Prada where the secretary is driving around trying to get too much done and everything is going wrong in the circumstances that she finds herself in - all beyond her control. Why it works in the Devil Wears Prada is because that woman is actually writing about what the book is about. Julie and Julia opens up with the author in the gynecologist's office getting bad news while the doctor is wiping off his speculum. (A book about food begins with a gynecologist wiping off his speculum? No no no!) And somewhere from there it goes on about selling her eggs to pay off debt. And then she's in the subway with severe body odor and everyone is crazy and somehow she ends up at the market and she's purchased the items for potato soup. It doesn't work because there was too much information - the type of information that is better given later - after the reader starts to feel like he or she knows the writer and would be more comfortable getting such intimate details. I would have also suggested removing the sections on Paul and Julia because it was off-focus and didn't bring anything to the memoir. Less is always more. Well, you get the point. The author may still sell a lot of copies since the title is a bit deceiving but she will probably have fewer repeat buyers if a second book is in her future.

Marketing is the last thing I'll mention. This is clearly a book suited to a certain age group - late 20s/early 30s. The problem is with the fact that Julia Child is an icon, a pioneer really, and she appeals to a lot of people, especially people who have been watching her shows since the beginning and reading her books (the first-edition buyers). It should have been marketed to the specific demographic than as broadly as it was (because of the misinterpretation of the title). Though many younger people would be fine with most of the book, the tone, the language and opinions, I would say that the over 50 crowd might not be OK with all of the profanity, sexual references and general unhappiness that overwhelms what the focus of the book was meant to be - a book about trying to cook all of Julia's recipes in one year in one small place. And unfortunately, many of these hard-core Julia devotees won't really get what the book is about until after they've spent the bucks and are angry about it. I was also left with the impression that Julie didn't really like Julia all that much. I'm curious to see how her next project compares to this. It will be very telling.",263 people found this helpful,0
