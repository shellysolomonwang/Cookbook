The paper even feels amazing.
As I sat and read the book, I thought, ‚Äúfinally a book I can cook everything from!‚Äù
I very much appreciate the nut-alternative recipes. Most of the cookbooks only show recipes with tree nuts, which makes it really difficult with a tree nut allergy.

First of all, it's a huge book... packed full of good stuff! It doesn't just include recipes but also tons of tips and tricks for navigating a low carb lifestyle. I have made so many recipes out of this cookbook and every one of them has turned out amazing. Personal favorites are all of the casseroles (so easy and flavorful!) and her pizza eggs (seriously these eggs are amazing!). One of the highlights for me is her dessert chapter. I have made so many of these recipes and they turn out perfectly every single time.

Her recipes are easy to read and follow and don't use weird or hard to find ingredients. She keeps it simple but full of flavor and totally foolproof. After this cookbook was such a hit, I went out and bought all of the other one's Kyndra has written!",,1
25,"Craveable Keto: Your Low-Carb, High-Fat Roadmap to Weight Loss and Wellness (1)",5,Recommend!,Format: Paperback,This was the first cookbook I got of Kyndra‚Äôs. I love that it comes with the meal plans using only the recipes in the book (and says what page the recipe is on right there instead of having to go looking for it) All the recipes I have tried so far has been great! I usually only try 1 new recipe each week so I don‚Äôt have to worry about wasting money on food we wouldn‚Äôt eat but with this cookbook I tried a whole weeks worth of new dinners and very happy to say we liked them all! It also has the nutritional value which is helpful. The only thing I could say would make it better would be for her to add what brands of ingredients she used since every brand seems to have different nutritional information so I still usually have to figure out what the macros are when I track everything. Now I cannot wait to get my hands on the 30 minute ketogenic book she has out.,One person found this helpful,1

My lower rating is for two reasons,Format: Paperback,There is a wide variety of recipes in this book that are great. My lower rating is for two reasons. 1) Recipes don't talk about organic or whole food which really are a large part of what make these foods healthiest 2) A large amount of the recipes include erythritol in some form. If you do your research well you'll learn this is bad for you and can actually cause negative side effects. This ingredient can naturally occur in certain foods like fermented foods but that's done naturally and is ok. This ingredient if not naturally occurring in food is most often made synthetically by man and as a result is a GMO food. This was a bummer to learn this book includes this ingredient and so often. I get it that it's a no calorie sweetner but there are other more natural healthier options such as Stevia.,9 people found this helpful,0
