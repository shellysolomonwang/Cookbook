0,"The Plant Paradox Cookbook: 100 Delicious Recipes to Help You Lose Weight, Heal Your Gut, and Live Lectin-Free",5,Highly Recommended,Format: Kindle Edition,"Well, I am sincerely happy with the book. That’s why I wanted to share this review with you. The book is divided in two parts: the first covers the Plant Paradox Program in detail, whereas the second brings easy-to-prepare recipes divided in categories.

The first part of the book is where we learn the details about the program: the background and effects of lectins in our bodies, the common disrupters we may not be aware of, as well as a detailed explanation on how we should approach the program to bring back our innate happy and healthy life.

Please, the first part of this book can either be a refresher of the main book if you have already read that, or it can be the only book to read if you haven’t read that yet. That is, don't bother and get this one instead. You will find ordered and well-explained information covering pretty much all aspects of the program proposed, including the list of desirable food choices as well as the list of those we want to avoid in order to keep low inflammation. I say that because I ended up reading the main book twice and is still fresh in order to compare them both.

The second part of the book is quite delightful. Now, as I edit this review written previously, I wanted to add that I have prepared around 10 of the dishes in the book. First one was the ""Cream of Mushroom Soup"", and sincerely enjoyed the result. Then tried the delicious ""Brazilian Cheezy Bread"" which is a yummy snack together with a cup of tea/coffee. From the main dishes I have tried a handful and cannot say which one has been my favorite so far. My family loves the ""Halibut with Mushrooms"" and I personally enjoy cooking the ""Spinach Artichoke Lasagna"".

As a side note, most recipes seem to be straightforward, and the ingredient list idem. Also, it's important to note that the recipes will please both vegans and omnivorous.

Even though I am fortunate to be in good health that let me spend time outdoors to go on adventures and move freely, I sincerely believe this lifestyle proposed by Gundry can be a healing approach to foster better health even if we don't have any health issue. At first his viewpoints can be daunting, but it makes completely sense once we understand the ""whys"" behind it, as well as after complying with the program for only 2–3 weeks. I felt more vibrant upon starting his approach, my skin felt healthier after 2 weeks, my digestive system seems to work even smoother, and I feel lighter. Deep inside we all can find ways to create a more positive, meaningful and healthier lifestyle, nurturing from inside out. Nutrition, after all, is one of the foundation aspects. Besides Gundry's approach, I do enjoy Mercola's ""Fat for Fuel"" book and Longo's ""The Longevity Diet"" book. After all they are complementary and based on recent health studies/research.

Lastly, one of the ultimate readings, which I have just finished and has already influenced my thoughts deeply, is a book called ""No Recipe: Cooking as Spiritual Practice"" from Edward Brown. Combining the Plant Paradox Program principles together with inspiring reflections from Brown can definitely influence our perceptions around nurturing our bodies and souls.

Take good care,

Inulin, specific branded products, monk fruit, xylitol, etc. The inclusion of branded products is what I disliked in the recipes.
I'm hoping the lectins information is accurate, because there is at least one sloppy history reference for now!
""pumpkins, acorn squash, zucchini, and butternut squash—is native to the Americas. Meaning, it contains lectins that humans have only been exposed to in the last five hundred years or so.""
Mmm... So, native Americans, and their descendants are unicorns, Martians or mutants? Maybe Latin American descendants have better tolerance for those plants but that don't make someone not human.
Please correct this nonsense.",10 people found this helpful,1

Our goal was just to eat healthier. Having adopted this eating plan for less than 2 months my husband and I have each dropped better than 10 lbs. with no exercise program involved. It's amazing that eliminating foods containing 'lectins', reducing certain grains and fruits but increasing healthy fats can change your metabolism and cut cravings.

430,"The Plant Paradox Cookbook: 100 Delicious Recipes to Help You Lose Weight, Heal Your Gut, and Live Lectin-Free",5,EXCELLENT Book and Lifestyle,Format: Hardcover,"I, admittedly had never heard of the Plant Paradox, but saw Kelly Clarkson chatting up her recent weight loss and singing the praises of Dr. Gundry, so I fan-girled and bought the original book and the cookbook.

My husband and I skipped phase 1 and didn’t bother with the laxative and cleanse, we just jumped right into the recipes, regardless if they were Phase 1, 2 or 3. Our issue has always been mindless snacking, lots of wine and oversized portions. We tend to eat “healthy”, but this book makes you re-think foods that have long been considered healthy. Weight has been melting off both of us without increased exercise or hunger. NO acid reflux or bloating. The only fruit we have now, is avocado and fresh citrus for flavoring. We completely did away with breads, nuts, grains, potatoes and beans, although many ARE permitted in the Plant Paradox plan.

Dr. Gundry’s approach is not caloric based or restrictive. The recipes do not include nutritional info, which makes this program not feel like a diet. The first few recipes I made, we looked at our portions and thought: oh, no! so small! However, they are perfect, satisfying portions based on filling greens and generous proteins. We seem to stay full longer and since there is little to no sugar, our bellies feel content and our energy levels are stable.

I was concerned that many of the ingredients would be difficult to find locally, as we don’t have a Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods nearby. Happily, most of the ingredients are available at our chain supermarket and at a small health food store in the area, as well as here on Amazon. I am currently obsessed with buffalo butter and goat yogurt.

The recipes we have tried thus far have been delicious and we aren’t missing flavors and textures. They are super simple to read and follow. The meals are filling, quick and easy. The recipes leave lots of room to experiment, as well. I have adapted a kale recipe to include lots of sautéed kale, mushrooms, onions, goat cheese,balsamic vinegar and topped with sliced beef and boiled egg and shredded carrots that we eat at least 3 days a week. (Good with shrimp or chicken or no meat, too!). Amazing.

The recipes get you thinking outside the box.

Who knew that we would LOVE Ralph’s Breakfast Scramble??? Scrambled eggs with carmelized onions, spices, herbs and creamy chunks of avocado. Soooo good. We have come to love the taste and texture of cauliflower rice and Miracle Noodles and throw Kale into just about every meal. Miracle noodles or cauliflower rice are the perfect base to add veggies, spices and proteins. Filling and delicious

We can even enjoy a glass of Malbec and squares of rich, dark chocolate after dinner. We found that the portion is just enough to satisfy the sweet tooth and the pairing of Malbec with the chocolate really awakens the flavors of both.

The pictures and layout of the book were very encouraging as well. So much easier to be able to visualize what you are doing!!! I do take issue with the evolutionary rational...come on! 45 million years ago???? Really???? who do you know was there? What ancient document do you have that backs this up??? I think more current science has provided facts that can stand alone without the theory farce. I happened to also read Jordan Rubin's book, 10 Day Diet Revolution. The information is very similar, but without all the evolution nonsense. After I read that, I was ready to see this through and I am glad I have. After a month,I feel better and can see improvement in the rheumatoid inflammation that has plagued me for so long. Truth is truth no matter what lie it is wrapped in. The diet works.",4 people found this helpful,1

The mint choc chip ice cream fails to list anything minty,,I think the choc mint cookies may have mixed up tablespoons and cups, and the wild rice side fails to tell you what the ‘rice’ component is to call out a few boo boos. I really like the books, and if you are considering one of the book summaries I see on Kindle, the cookbook covers the essentials of the program, including supplements and the basis of the diet (I.e. cellular health thru a healthy gut bloom). I believe this book needed a little more Q&A. We will need to figure out what is missing or wrong, but that might be a fun puzzle.",2 people found this helpful,1

My only wish is that for sweeteners, there would be an included substitute list or rational of why one in particular was selected (Stevia vs. Swerve, for example) because the recipes vary on sweetener and don't say how to substitute or why you wouldn't want to (maybe some perform better under certain cooking conditions?).

1. It does not state in all cases whether a recipe is Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3. This would have been so easy to do. (In case you're wondering, the photo of the pizza on the front cover of the book is only compliant with Phase 3 of the diet - which you may never reach if you have certain health issues.) Annoying!
2. There is no nutritional information for any of the recipes - this is a serious oversight for a recipe book that's supposed to be about healthy eating. How to make informed decisions on portion sizes etc.? This is a huge drawback for me.
3. It does not state if any of the recipes are suitable for the Keto version of the diet. I was really hoping for some ketogenic recipes, so this is disappointing.
4. Some of the recipes rely on things like Quorn, which are no longer compliant, so there are a bunch of recipes you can't even make.
5. Not all of the recipes have photos. Not a major, but I personally like a photo with every recipe. I need visual inspiration to cook.

She also said there are what are called Blue Zones in the world and those are the places in the world where people live the longest and they eat lots of beans which is a no no for Gundry unless you pressure cook them and these people aren't doing that!! Also in one of Dr. Gregor's videos on nightshades he said that 1 in 20 people have a bad reaction which is not everyone!!!! Like Gundry thinks. She said he has some product called reds something and those are good. So I just wasted my time on this book. Also Gundry in the book said any GFR under 90 shows your kidneys are bad and I asked the nurse p. about that statement and she said the labs my doctor uses are the range of good kidney function for GFR is 60 or greater. So Gundry didn't even say in this book that different labs have different ranges which could cause anxiety in someone who has the lab which is 60 or higher.
