12,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",5,All the Yummies!,Format: Hardcover,"Sahara Rose.... an amazing, insightful and beautiful soul! Her first book Idiot's Guide to Ayurveda is amazing. I am getting my copy of Eat Feel Fresh TOMORROW! I'm dying to have it in my hands. It's like Christmas Eve right now. LOL I've seen a few of the recipes already shared from her cook book and I know I'll be able to prepare these easily. I am starting an Ayurveda Masters in Digestion and Nutrition program with Joyful Belly next week and cannot wait to have some quick and easy meals from Sahara Rose's book to use during the next 10 months of crazy work schedule balanced with new school schedule. Thank you Sahara Rose for your just right timing. Love you girl!

UPDATE: I got the book and made my weekly work meal prep that week! I used one of the 6 taste bowls! YUMMY! I'll be making a new 6 taste bowl for the upcoming week of work (school teacher). I also do not microwave it, I just do not add an ice pack to my lunch box and eat it room temp. ;)",5 people found this helpful,1
13,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",5,This is a book of self-love!,Format: Hardcover," This books is a true treasure! Sahara Rose’s essence really comes through as well as her deep selfless desire to help others. It’s engaging because she relays things in layman’s terms, and her personality and spirit come through with her personal journey to optimal health. I literally received it today and it is living up to all of my expectations. It will be in my purse for a while because I am now in the school of Eat Feel Fresh.
I am a stage 3 cancer survivor seven years out now. I did a cleanse with holistic doctors in 2014 and they set my body on track which it had just never been at. I got off course with my eating habits and my body and soul have been calling out for me to get back on track. And the universe sends me this book, no coincidence!
I literally vibe with books or not and this one from the onset was calling my name. Not only is it a beautiful work of art but the content is amazing. She breaks things down for us like the essence of Ayurveda and how it relates to yoga , how the book modernizes Ayurveda, the Doshas and how to know which one you are, alkalinity in the body and foods, the chakras, and so much more! There are even healing mantras, (my heart jumped for joy with this one)!
What gets even better are the recipes! They are amazing, and encompassing of global cuisines! This is trés important for me as I LOVE food and consider myself a foodie at heart! My love of eating is what got me off my course on healthy eating as I need variety and excitement for my taste buds. The ingredients are easy to find and there are plenty of tips to make things easy. Everything from sauces, pesto, desserts, drinks, soups, bowls, curries, and more. Some of the recipes that I’m so looking forward to making:
*Lebanese Lentil Bowl
*Bento Box Sushi Bowl
*Chakra Soups
*Roasted Cauliflower and Lentil Tacos
*Plant-Based Pho
*Sweet Potato Lentil Shepherd’s Pie
*Raw Rose and Pistachio Cheesecake
Eeeek, so excited!!!!
I’m starting this Saturday with the Chai pancakes as I already have all the ingredients!
This is the cookbook for these new times of higher awareness and consciousness. Getting it is definitely a step in the right direction to alignment of mind body and spirit.",3 people found this helpful,1
14,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",5,This is so much more than a beautifully illustrated cook book!!!,Format: Hardcover,"After witnessing modern medicine make my mother sicker and eventually causing her to lose her battle to cancer even quicker I became determined to find a better and safer way to heal the body. For over 9 years my research has continually led me back to Ayurveda which then has led me to Sahara Rose. After taking one of her courses I then started reading her books. I was so excited to learn that she had created a cook book. I really needed something I could easily understand that would help me incorporate Ayurveda into my daily life. To my surprise this book has been sooooo much more than a cook book! The first 90 pages or so focus on every aspect of Ayurveda you need to know. The rest of the book is filled with wonderful dosha specific and tridoshic recipes that are easy to make and many of them take very few ingredients. A lot of the recipes include beautiful pictures of each dish which are not only a joy to look at but also very helpful. I like to know what my own dish should look like! The first recipe I made from this book was the Golden Mylk from the ""Potions"" section. After reading Sahara's take on why this drink is so great I just had to make this right away!! (Reduces inflammation and flushes fat.) Yes please! Thank you Sahara for all your hard work! My family and I will be forever grateful for the all the knowledge who have shared with the rest of the world!",4 people found this helpful,1

When I eat the recipes from this book I feel better, especially my stomach and my energy.
I am already gluten free and mostly vegan, (with some meat if I cook myself or know where it comes from) but I still have trouble with my stomach. But not so much when I eat this food.
I have been sharing it all over my Instagram and have gotten some others to order it now as well. My boyfriend even likes the recipes! And this guy mostly eats pizza. (Literally EVERY meal he has to have some kind of bread, and cheese.) And the last couple of times we’ve cooked from this book he was so happy and satisfied, a miracle even.

I stumbled upon Sahara Rose's website a while back and thoroughly enjoyed her take on Ayurveda, and her ability to convey the information in an understandable format. Needless to say, I was very excited when I found out she was releasing Eat Feel Fresh!

Rose makes it incredibly easy to understand how to incorporate Ayurvedic principles into your cooking, plus the recipes are delicious. Paryavasthita Chai Pancakes? Lakshimi Raw Rose & Pistachio Cheesecake? YES, PLEASE! The recipes are split into six sections: Breakfasts for Your Dosha, Six-Taste Bowls (each is a hearty meal in a bowl), Tridoshic Dinners (make a dinner that works for EVERYONE!), Snacks & Sides, Desserts, and Potions.

17,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",5,Best Cookbook I’ve Ever Bought,Format: Hardcover,"I FREAKING LOVE this cookbook. I normally buy cookbooks and end up finding one or two recipes I like in it and the rest are a waste. This book is not only gorgeous in every sense (I seriously look at it everyday), but the recipes are phenomenal. Not only that but the entire beginning of the book goes into detail about Ayurveda and each dosha and every recipe is tailored to each dosha. Even if you aren’t into Ayurveda and just want delicious plant based recipes (that I might I add are pretty simple) this is the perfect book. You can tell how much effort the author put into it and it’s well worth the buy! I’ve made quite a few recipes already from the book and every single one has been delicious. Also, the recipes are low sugar which I’m a fan of. Sahara Rose really tailors to just about everyone in this cookbook and that’s coming from someone who has a lot of food intolerances and dietary restrictions. i can’t rave about this book enough, honestly. I’m impressed.",2 people found this helpful,1

I have an extensive plant based cookbook collection, & this is one I’ve been (im)patiently waiting to devour.

The photography is absolutely stunning, & the beginning of the book explains Ayurveda in a fresh, accessible way. If you follow Sahara & listen to her podcast, or if you have read other books on Ayurveda, you might be versed on the doshas, but I find that the extensive, fun layout makes it easier to go deeper & really pinpoint your dosha &/or any imbalances you currently have, & to know how to eat & live to get back to your body’s natural state of balance.

I got out a pad of sticky notes to mark the recipes I wanted to try, &—-well, I used the entire pad. I’m a Vata with an intolerance to grains AND legumes AND oats, & still found plenty of colorful, vibrant recipes I can make & thrive on. Every single recipe is vegan & GF, which is such a plus, & a rare combination in cookbooks.

Do yourself a favor & get lost in the pretty pages of this book (& check out Sahara’s prolific, astoundingly informative podcast). You’ll discover more about your true self & how to feed her/him in a way that supports your OWN unique dharmic design.",3 people found this helpful,1
19,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",4,"Beautiful, Informative, and non-scary recipes!",Format: Hardcover,"I LOVE this cookbook! I didn't expect the first 3rd of the book the be a welcome to Ayurveda and an explanation of the doshas, but it makes sense that it is there. The recipes look fantastic! I was afraid that they would not actually be easy or would have hard to obtain ingredients, but they are not scary at all! I have not tried any yet but I have incorporated aspects of them like using sweet potato slices for toast, and adding pumpkin and spices to my morning oatmeal.
The book is so beautiful that my kids and husband flip through it also as it sits on the coffee table. My teenage son may be more concerned with the pretty girl in the pictures than the recipes or learning more about his dosha, but if it gets him to accidentally learn then I am okay with it, lol!",2 people found this helpful,1

Her 1st book “Idiot’s Guide...” blew me away in the best way possible with how to understand what Ayurveda truly is and how to incorporate it into your life.

NOW, with eat feel fresh, you can incorporate the 6 tastes, the tri-doshic meals, and the dharma and dosha balancing into your life, as well as friends and family. Most of us know that the dinner table and food is what we share most, and being balanced is attainable by slight tweaks between meals. Honestly, you can feel the LOVE and HIGH ENERGETIC VIBE in the words & pictures Sahara shares. This colorful book has me even more excited on balancing my body, using food as my medicine to do it, as well as balancing my mind through Ayurvedic practices. From spices to chakras, this book is a gateway to increasing health, radiance, and light. Sahara wants this information shared with all, and delivers it in the most amazing fashion. Highly recommend to anyone interested in delicious recipes and Ayurveda. Don’t forget she also offers her free quiz online and resources on her podcast and website. This book is better than expected.

35,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",5,The Modern Ayurveda book you’ve been waiting for,Format: Hardcover,I discovered Ayurveda last year and SOON discovered Sahara Rose. She is the person I was waiting for on this path as she brings modern life and Ayurveda together in such a seamless way. This book is way more than just recipes as she really breaks down the doshas and how to live in an Ayurvedic way without stressing about perfection. Cover to cover it is so thoughtful and the photography/photos are gorgeous. I feel my absolute best when I am eating in the way she teaches (I’m talking losing the bloat after years and years of having constant food babies in tow).

I discovered Ayurveda and Sahara Rose and was really intrigued by the Doshas (mind-body types) but didn't really know how to implement my doshic needs in my cooking. Sahara's recipes are so customizable and she even has replacements for ingredients that seem really challenging to omit, like onions and garlic, for my Pitta imbalance. I'm also a big fan of Michael Greger's work (How Not to Die) and appreciate that many of his ""daily dozen"" ingredients are staples in this book as well and that Sahara doesn't include many processed ingredients (vegetable oils being the only one). I love her insight throughout the book, including quite a large portion of info about Ayurveda.

37,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",5,So Grateful for a Modern Book on Ayurveda!,Format: Hardcover,"I have been doing research on Ayurveda over the past few years and found myself very overwhelmed with the intense structure of daily activities. Also, the ancient teachings included strict rules on the types and methods of preparing foods. They suggested a lot of Dairy products and spices which did not resonate with me. Therefore I am grateful to have an alternative method of practicing Ayurveda that fits with my lifestyle and eating habits!

So far I have tried the Thai Green Coconut Curry and was amazed by the flavor! The Green Curry Paste was so good that my boyfriend and I are going to make it as a dipping sauce for our next party. We are looking forward to making the Spaghetti Squash with Lentil-Walnut Plantballs tonight. I have also tried the Vata Om-Meal for breakfast and keep the batch in the refrigerator to warm up before work in the morning. I only eat a small portion every day so it has almost lasted me an entire week.

I am inspired and excited to try more recipes and learn from Sahara. I listen to her podcast on my commute to work and have experienced her Masterclass with Shaman Durek. I look forward to building my own brand and practicing my healing and speaking gift with others. I am so grateful to have found her gift of inspiring others to become their best self and live a life of financial freedom doing what they love!

I ordered it in hardback instead of just getting the eBook and am impressed by the quality and durability of the book (along with its contents). Sahara explains Ayurveda in a way that makes it accessible to a wide audience and across generations/cultures. When I have eaten at Ayurvedic restaurants, I have not been a huge fan of the food but Maya Tiwari and now Sahara Rose Ketabi have changed that. The recipes in Eat Feel Fresh are so good that I have made them for my family and they are now regular staples in our diet. My four year old loves the smoothie bowls and the Pho. I like that the recipes have flavor that you can customize for your dosha and you will feel a difference in how these foods make your body feel.",,1
40,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",5,Healing through Delicious Food,Format: Hardcover,"I am so delighted to have this book and I cannot wait to cook every single recipe in it! I first started learning about Ayurveda after stumbling across Sahara's Idiot's Guide to Ayurveda earlier this year and have really enjoyed learning about my doshas and figuring out how to balance myself through a much deeper understanding of my body and mind. I have noticed that when I try to be more aware of my doshas when eating, I feel better; and when I try to plan my day more for my doshas, my day goes smoother too!

Then, enter Sahara's next book full of beautiful plant-based recipes that also sound delicious and also easy to make. Sometimes I feel frustrated with plant-based cookbooks because they make me feel like I need to run out and buy a whole bunch of ingredients that I don't normally stock in my cupboards, and changing over is just so expensive. But she uses ingredients that I already love and enjoy, plus some new fun ones for me, to make cooking for my doshas delicious, easy, and fun. I also love how she's adapted recipes and flavors from around the world. And, the whole first part of the book is about learning these new terms and applying them to how you cook (totally a Pitta cook, Pitta AF!), how you eat, and just how you live. Sahara is a wealth of knowledge and it shines through in everything she does -- her books, her podcast, and her Instagram.

Although I cook for myself, I also really appreciate how she has different variations for her base recipes depending on doshas, so it's easily for families - her chai pancakes, for instance, have Vata types topping them with almond butter, fresh berries, and monk fruit maple syrup; Pitta types topping them with sliced bananas, walnuts and monk fruit maple syrup; and Kapha types toping them with pomegranate arils and cacao nibs.

I haven't yet had a chance to try recipes (because I'm Pitta AF and had already meal-planned for next week by the time I got the cookbook...) but can't wait to make literally every single one and continue delving into Ayurveda.

The recipes are well organized and there is a great index at the front of the book (not sure why some cookbooks neglect this.)

As an Indian-American, I've always been sort of peripherally familiar with Ayurveda, growing up with a pious and remedy-happy mother, but I never really understood the background or how/why it came to be; always knew just a few tips and tricks that somehow worked, and had a weird aversion to modern medicine, ha.

Sahara Rose was my perfect introduction into something that made me feel so much more connected to my body and my culture as I'm on my journey towards self-betterment. This book is just an extension of that, and I can't wait to try all of the recipes and grow more attuned to my Kapha/Pitta dosha. The photos in the book are stunning, the recipes clear, and the organization is very easy to follow (along with some very helpful answers as to why certain ingredients work the way they do).

As an Ayurvedic student and practitioner myself, I will be using this with my clients, because I completely agree with Sahara’s position- that Ayurveda is a beautiful system of mind body medicine but it needed a contemporary upgrade to fit the changing context of our culture in the West today. We are facing a health epidemic in the United States in large part because of our chemical and industrial farming practices, which have pillaged the land and animals and contributed to our nation’s rising food allergies.

When I received it my first impression was how beautiful it is...the pictures, colors, the style of writing, everything. But more importantly, the content is laid out well and easy to understand. This is a good book for people new to Ayurveda as it doesn't go so in depth that you just want to put it down and never look at it again (like I did with other ones). I haven't yet made any of the recipes, but the ingredients are common and recipes don't appear complicated. I especially like the modern twist on foods we like to eat. I would recommend the book to anyone.",One person found this helpful,1

This book makes Ayurvedic cooking accessible and frankly, more interesting/diverse than a traditional diet would allow. The book is an absolute work of art- how could you not want to make every recipe? The desserts! The Six Taste Bowls! Stunning and nourishing.
I also appreciate the care taken to craft mostly tridoshic recipes, for those of us with multiple mouths to feed.

She is truly an amazing educator and Ayurvedic practitioner.

I’ve always been interested in Ayurveda but struggled with how to truly integrate it into my life without just making warm curries and rice.

This cookbook provides ancient medicine knowledge in a modern way we can easily understand. The recipes are creative and colorful and it’s honestly a big part of whatever healing you’re working on.

The first recipe I made was a sweet potato and lentil bowl with turmeric tahini dressing. It was AMAZING and the dressing was so colorful. Everyone was looking at me at work and staring and like “what are you eating that’s so pretty”. Not that food needs to be pretty but I think that it has a positive impact on our relationship to it.

Eat Feel Fresh does a really good job of inspiring you to eat in a way that’s good for your spirit. Learning about Ayurveda from Sahara rose in her podcast and in her books has been hugely important for me and my health these past couple months.

I realized why my body was acting the way it was and still bloating even though I was eating “healthy” due to the foods I were and were not putting in my body. Sahara tells you the WHY this is happening and this book makes it so easy and simple for everyone to follow, but it also shows you what body type you are and how to celebrate your dosha’s needs.

556,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",4,"Gorgeous photography, beautiful food to nurture your soul",Format: Hardcover,"I love food. I enjoy gorgeous photography. I practice yoga. And I feel that every day can be a good day when you learn a new thing or two. So, I was quite happy to snatch up a copy of “Eat Feel Fresh” for review. First of all, it is simply the most beautifully illustrated book I’ve had the pleasure to read this year. The colors explode off the pages and bring a smile to your face, which can only be a good thing. Secondly, it is chock-full of new spins on recipes but as always, let’s stick to the advice of the Red Queen and start at the beginning.

One thing you will likely notice right away is that Deepak Chopra is literally plastered all over this book, cover to cover and anywhere in between, having written the foreword and being quoted once or twice, as well. If you’re not a fan of Dr. Chopra’s, you won’t enjoy the close relationship he and Ms. Ketabi clearly have. Another point that didn’t take long to irritate me was the reference to an ‘alkaline diet.’ There is no evidence whatever that you can change the pH value of your body chemistry through diet, nor should you. Various parts of your body have different pH values, so what would you even be aiming at? Also, the term ‘detox’ is used, and saying something that silly even once costs you points in a review. Detoxing is done by your organs all the time, every minute of every day, and it is simply incorrect to claim that you need to change your diet to accomplish this. More correctly, you can assist your organs in their admittedly life-supporting function by avoiding to indiscriminately stuff yourself with items of questionable nutritional value. If we can agree on this, then let’s move on to the good stuff, and there is certainly plenty.

I had never heard of Ms. Ketabi before, but apparently, she is an expert in the field of ayurveda, the ancient Indian ‘science of life,’ a system of medicine that encompasses far more than simply treating symptoms of illness. “Eat Feel Fresh” gives you a semi-thorough introduction into ayurveda and the three doshas, or elements, that form a person’s body type and personality, frequently in a unique combination. The way you eat can help balance the doshas, leading to increased wellness. I find Ms. Ketabi’s writing personality quite accessible. “Eat Feel Fresh” aims to bring a new, modern approach to ayurvedic principles so that they can be more easily integrated into the Western lifestyle. There is a spiritual component to this approach, as ayurveda is a holistic system. Some may find this esoteric, others refreshing and insightful.

Once you have determined your dosha, head right into the recipe part of the book which offers tridoshic meals, meaning there is a base recipe with variations, according to what you have learned in part one. All recipes are gluten-free and plant-based, and the number of recipes containing what some might consider exotic ingredients is very, very small. We love experimenting with food and frequently cook Indian dishes, so our kitchen is well stocked in that regard. If you are only starting to branch out into international cooking, the initial investment could possibly seem daunting, but you will use most spices and staples over and over.

There is good basic information about stocking your pantry, meal planning and prepping, what to do with leftovers, and how to prepare basic staples, like grains and legumes. The recipe section ecompasses everything, from breakfasts, bowls, dinners, snacks and sides, to desserts and potions (which actually means teas, mylks, and juices). You won’t be eating endless varieties of curry, either: there are colorful soups, burgers, pizza, shepherd’s pie, tacos, grain-free chapatis and naan, creative variations on hummus, delicious Indian sweets like kheer, and intriguing twists on American favorites, like Raw Rose and Pistachio Cheesecake, Chickpea Chocolate Crunch Bark, and several versions of brownies.

As is common these days, there is no nutritional information given for any of the dishes. Would I get a copy for myself? Likely. I am intrigued by the idea of maximizing my personal health and wellness, based on ayurvedic ideas, and most certainly fascinated by a lot of the recipes (I’ve bookmarked a couple to try but have not had the chance yet). I did find some of the information on balancing your doshas a bit confusing, though, and on days when I’m more skeptical than spiritual, the ‘esoteric babble’ would likely bug me to a point.

“Eat Feel Fresh” will be published by DK, a publisher with a huge catalog of informational and educational titles. I received a free copy via Netgalley in exchange for a review. It should be fairly obvious that all opinions are my own.",8 people found this helpful,1

Love, Love them both! So ""eat feel fresh"" this is not your typical cookbook. Thank you Sahara for filling your book with much knowledge of how to nourish our bodies and minds. I finally recognize which Dosha I am and how to support that but beyond that the spices that nourish and heal us, even the temperature of foods and how this effects us. I so needed this. It is refreshing to spend a little more time in the kitchen and to feel comfortably full and satisfied with these delicious recipes. And to be reminded that balance is everything. This is a book I cherish. Its place of honor is on my kitchen table. I do not eat ""the Ayurvedic way"" all the time--at times far from it but I now know how to make all meals more healing. It's also a great book to experiment with a little at a time. Enjoy!",2 people found this helpful,1
558,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",4,"Stunning Presentation, But Involved",Format: Hardcover,"I love the look and feel of the Eat Feel Fresh cookbook. Replete with tantalizing culinary photography, this is the kind of stunning tome to have on a coffee table for guests to leaf through, no pun intended.

Beyond first impressions from a visual standpoint, this cookbook is not an easy proposition. It is a book that is very involved and would require taking time out to really dig through the holistic teachings that are an integral part of Ayurvedic healing system.

I appreciate the fact that healthy plant-based dishes are gaining mainstream traction. This book helps us go beyond the concept of simple consumption, and elevates food as a sacred, medicinal force that can be life changing. As I slowly introduce more and more plant-based recipes into to my mealtime routine, I appreciate well-designed cookbooks that make healthy food preparation an uplifting adventure. However, this is a book meant to read, study, and imbibe. It's a commitment. For now, I am going to enjoy adding some of the scrumptious recipes in my dietary plan. I will delve fully into its teachings and theories as time permits.

Visually and artistically, it's 5 stars for presentation and design. Every page is well thought out art. It's a stunning cookbook that makes food look beautiful and fresh. It's a good quality hardcover with full bleed printing (vibrant), case bound perfect binding, and a thick, cushiony cover. It makes for a pleasing-to-hold-in-hands collectible. There is spot varnish on the striking cover. Everything about this publication is beautifully conceived and full of good vibes and I'd recommend it for anyone into great cookbooks as well as those more focused on its Ayurvedic teachings.

559,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",5,Beautiful book,Format: Kindle Edition,"The first thing that struck me as I paged through Eat Feel Fresh was how beautiful the photography was. The prepared dishes are exquisite art that makes you want to immediately grab a fork or spoon.

I was peripherally aware of the Ayurvedic lifestyle from an article I read a few years ago, but like a lot of things, I read it, found it intriguing, but didn’t pursue it further. However after reading Sahara Rose Ketabi’s Eat Feel Fresh, I want to try out the recipes for my particular dosha and see what happens.

Another thing I loved about this book is that it’s like a vegetarian’s paradise. I can eat every single one of these recipes! You don’t know how infrequently that happens (yes, unless I’m looking at a vegetarian cookbook, ha).

The recipes include a lot of familiar favorites but with a slant. Pho, Shepherd’s Pie, and tacos are included and sound absolutely delicious, and healthier. Lentils for breakfast is a thing, and one I probably want to try as having a big dose of protein first thing in the morning is a great way to start the day. I also like the idea of a savory oatmeal as I’m a huge fan of oatmeal.

There are different takes on the Buddha bowl, a variety of hummus recipes, including one with sweet potatoes, which sounds intriguing. I’m not always keen on sweet potatoes, but in a hummus with turmeric? That might just happen in my kitchen.

And, oh, goodness, the raw rose and pistachio cheesecake looks simply too beautiful to eat, but considering how I love pistachios that’s unlikely to happen. And the spiced pistachio milk is also likely to happen. Yum.

I highly recommend Eat Feel Fresh, especially if you feel as if you’re in a rut and your body could use a jump-start. I just wish I could share the photographs with you!

I also try to stay away from sugar and unhealthy carbs. (Healthy carbs are welcome in my day and are in this cookbook.) I desperately want to eat less dairy, too.

I greatly appreciate that I can eat everything within this book. (I showed my husband this cookbook and told him that if he ever wanted to cook for me, every recipe was an option.) The recipes are mostly simple and I already have many of the ingredients used within my pantry.

I've been on a journey of increased spirituality and holistic wellness for a while now, but the pieces weren't really falling into place, and I was feeling out of balance with a too strict diet that wasn't satiating me.

562,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",5,Interesting concept that is well executed in this book,Format: Hardcover,"I have never heard of the ancient science of Ayurveda before trying this cookbook. I was not sure what to expect, but like trying new food, so thought I would give it a shot. Ayurveda teaches that food is divine medicine with the power to heal. The author Sahara Rose takes you on a journey to wellness. A cookbook is needed because the best foods for one person may not be beneficial to another. You use the cookbook to adjust what you eat according for the best possible outcome of health and wellness. Unlike many diets with rigid, one-size-fits-all guidelines, Ayurveda is a lifestyle that recognizes the ever-changing needs of each individual. I have incorporated foods that should work well for my body type, and following the book guidelines seems to be helping.

The cookbook guides you on how to eat according to your body's specific needs. First you identify your Dosha, or mind-body type, and then you use the cookbook to discover what foods are best for your body. You also learn how changes in season and climate affect your digestion so you can further narrow down the best foods for you. Rather than focusing on calories, you'll focus on food qualities and how they vibrate in sync or out of sync to your body. This book is both chock full of info and has a beautiful design within its pages. I definitely recommend giving this book a try.",One person found this helpful,1
563,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",5,A fascinating cookbook — and so much more than a cookbook!,Format: Hardcover,"The opening pages of this book take a deep look at the foods we eat and how they affect mind, body and spirit. The author gives us a mini education on the Ayurvedic approach to healing and eating.

The Ayurvedic system is geared to the individual. A healing food for one person might be poison for another. In this book we have the fun of identifying our own personal mind-body type. There are detailed descriptions of the major types and even little quizzes to help you determine what you should be eating according to your personality, physical build, skin quality, digestion, energy level etc. Most of the recipes in the book indicate how to customize the recipe to be especially beneficial for your mind-body type.

Just reading about how certain foods promote bliss, energy and confidence made me feel blissful. At the same time the gorgeous photography made healthy food look incredibly attractive. I actually felt a craving for the right food, for a change.

Various spices get write-ups vividly describing their healing benefits. And of course we encounter all of these wonderful spices in the recipes.

The recipes that appealed the most to me were the simplest ones, like Sweet Potato Toast, Grain-Free Naan, Curry Ginger, Avocado Tahini Dip and Dosha Tea. I will also definitely try the Avocado Fudge Brownies. The 6-Taste Bowls are fascinating, but involve advance preparation and are a bit too complicated for me.

I don’t have a food processor, a juicer or a blender, so I have to improvise. A well-equipped cook should have no trouble following these recipes. I may use them more for ideas than explicit instructions, but this is still major. This cookbook has changed my way of thinking about food.

It was interested to read into another culture's take on medicinal eating and I found that some of the principles that go into Chinese medicinal eating applies in some ways to Ayurvedic. Ketali's book spends the first eighty pages explaining the background and principles behind the Ayurvedic diet. The information is presented in a very user friendly way. From pages eighty to ninety, she goes into the healthy benefits of various ingredients, how to stock your pantry, and how to make the Ayurvedic diet work for you. From pages nintey on, this is where the recipes begin.

The recipes were a little daunting for me at first, given that I have little experience with the ingredients and flavor profiles presented, however the recipes were easy to follow and the end results were very tasty. The photographs of the food are truly Instagram worthy - these are the most beautifully and colorfully plated dishes I've ever seen in a cookbook. Every recipe also focuses on whether the recipe is Vata (cooling), Pitta (heating), or Kapha (grounded/heavy). I enjoyed how Ketabi emphasizes that diet should be determined on season and personal health - both things that change over time.

Sahara has a one-of-a-kind gift to make Ayurveda accessible, fun and relatable. Also her plant-based approach is SO needed in today's world and the ghee/ rice in other Ayurveda books exactly what has held me back from Ayurveda in the past!

I think that is a quest that more people need to be encouraged to take, but it takes so much time to hit upon the foods that really allow us to excel.

I felt like this cookbook could have been much more accessible to more people had more common terms been used. I was attracted to this book because it recognizes that one size does not fit all. That right there is an easy way to describe what the author is trying to share, but instead there are all of these terms that relate to energies. Don't let that intimidate you. Find your type and then use that as a guide for finding foods that work because there are some solid recipes in this book.

I really liked the lentil walnut balls and seaweed broth and chocolate mousse. Some of the smoothies were hit or miss.

The ingredients are many and sometimes hard to find (ex: monk fruit sweetener). I NEVER made a recipe after work; all were efforts confined to a day when I was off and had greater flexibility.

As a huge fan of her first book on Ayurveda, I sought out to work with Sahara Rose because her explanation of a concept that once seemed foreign and confusing to me, was made simple and effective to follow. In comes, EAT FEEL FRESH. This book is amazing. I have been trying to follow the practices she mentions in her book and never had found one book that also was a cookbook with easy to follow recipes until this. I really love the information she provides on ALKALINE food, the chart breaking certain foods down, and the explanation of the doshas and what raw food means to them. I appreciate her acknowledging unique circumstances because no one person is the same and should always eat the same diet as another. Her six taste bowls are incredibly easy to follow and a staple in my home now. I cannot stress how great this book is, and it is an honor to know this genius woman personally.

570,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",5,Vegan must have!,Format: Hardcover,"When I read the description for this book I was immediately drawn to it.  I had no idea what Ayurveda was but could connect with the idea that we are what we eat, and to go further, we are how our bodies process food.  Those are such interesting ideas and not things that we are taught in the US as children learning to eat and cook.  I think that if I had heard this at a younger age, it would have led to some very fundamental changes in how and what I eat.

The first thing I loved about this book is the depth into Ayurveda that the author goes into.  She obviously has taken a lot of time to study and prepare food in the Ayurvedic way, as to warrant the amount of knowledge she has on the subject.  But seriously, this cookbook is more than just recipes, it's an entire course.  I started taking notes because this is something I am interested in and ended up 5 pages (front and back) later with a ton of notes and things to refer back to.  She is so well-versed in this subject and it is obviously her passion.  The explanation for each thing--doshas, chakras, acid and alkaline foods, alignment, yoga--is all so well-done and detailed.  As you start reading, it doesn't feel like you are reading someone's book on a topic they like.  You are reading someone's passion and life mission.  The author starts the book telling you about her and her problems; she makes the book very personalized.  As you read, you begin to trust her and what she is teaching in this book because she went through her own problems which were fixed by living an Ayurvedic lifestyle, but she also spent ample time living in cultures where this was a key facet to their food culture and health systems.  It's a brilliant collection of time, energy, care, and knowledge that she has compiled into a beautiful and introspective book, packed with exposition, to share and help others.

Secondly, and this is something that I noticed from the get to, was the photography.  She says early on that she went to India to do photography for this book, so we know that most if not all of the photos (maybe not all the food photos) were taken in India.  The photography is so bright and moving, it's almost could represent a collection of ethnographic work from the country.  The photos tell stories and they are perfect for this book.  I would buy this book for the photos alone!  The food photos, while just photos literally of food, are just as breathtaking!  They really make the food jump off the page and demonstrate how beautiful simple things put together can be.

Next, the setup of the book is so smart.  It starts with an emotional connection to the author and an understanding of where she is coming from and why she has taken on this subject.  Then, she continues with a rich and deep exposition about Ayurveda and the multiple systems that go into our health and the food we eat.  She doesn't skimp or shy away here.  As discussed, she goes over everything a beginner could possibly need, and probably more, even venturing into some academic-feeling work comparing and contrasting yoga with the subject.  Once you have this thick background and base knowledge, she introduces the recipes and does so in a way that is light and easy to follow.  Even though they are all vegan, it doesn't feel intimidating or not satisfying.  Rather, it's the complete opposite.  They are beautiful and seem so easy to prepare and incorporate into your own life and eating routine.  I loved that you get to enjoy the recipes after you feel like you know what you are reading about and the benefits of food.  The setup of the book demonstrates and reflects the author's own connection between mind, body, and food.  You begin with the knowledge-rich, mind-building base and then move to how this works and effects the body.  The book ends with the food that ties directly into those two.  It's an ideal setup and works perfectly for this book. 

And lastly, those recipes!  I make a lot of vegan food and eat a lot of it.  I know from experience that finding new recipes and ways to cook things can be daunting.  There were so many recipes and ways of preparing and combining food in this book that I had seriously never thought of.  There were things that I had never seen on Pinterest (where I gather most of my recipes).  I, no lie, copied almost all of these recipes down to use for the future.  

On Goodreads, I gave this book 5 stars because it's a good one!  The writing is well-done and clear, the educational based half of this book is concise and easy to follow.  I didn't get bogged down by foreign words or ideas; everything was outlined and explained in a way that was so easy for me to understand and export my own notes from.  I genuinely feel like I learned a lot from this book both about the subject and about myself and food.  I cannot wait to try some of these recipes and get a hardcopy of this for reference in my kitchen.  ",,1

She loves this book. First, the photography is simply stunning, beyond beautiful; it’s quite literally, the most beautiful book I’ve ever seen which makes the recipes look incredibly vibrant and delicious. Truly, this cookbook is a work of art. Beauty aside, the recipes, for the most part, are easier to make than many other vegan cookbooks we have tried. We have about 10 vegan cookbooks in our home, and this one definitely ranks in the top three (with the others being Vegan Fire and Spice, and Vegan for Everybody by Americas Test Kitchen). It is not easy to find vegan cookbooks which are also gluten free, but this one meets both of those requirements. The desserts are amazing and even our children love them, despite being healthier alternatives. The soups are easy and delicious. The breakfast items are creative and full of flavor (we have made the quinoa pancakes twice and even the children devour them). The kids also love the chickpea snacks which are great to take with us when we’re on-the-go. This cookbook is both beautiful as it is practical. We love how many vegetables and healthy spices the recipes call for. The title is correct - you do feel better after eating these meals.

The author does provide additional information about the Ayurvedic medicine practice. Some information in the book is not useful if you are not an avid yoga practitioner or Hindu. However, there is helpful information in the book regarding food intolerances and ways to substitute certain ingredients in meals where there is an intolerance or adverse reaction. Again, this book is very practical when you want to eat vegan but have illnesses such as celiac disease or food allergies or intolerances. The recipes are made to feed smaller families or couples, so you need to double the recipes for larger groups.

One negative for some people is that many of the recipes call for chickpeas, so if you do not like chickpeas or have an adverse reaction to them, you may be disappointed in not being able to use several of the recipes. However, I find that our kids love the chickpea recipes and its a great way to give them healthier options for snacks and meals.",,1

The beginning explains different doshas and more. I am new to this and and it's a lot of information to take in. I'm taking it one step at a time and famiarizing myself with foods and recipes for my dosha. There are many different spices and possibly food combinations to get used to. We were fortunate to live in a major city that had several Indian restaurants so some tastes are familiar. Not many Americans combine lentils and sweet potatoes, so be open minded, try the recipes you think you will enjoy first and move on from there. This cookbook will provide several. There are hints for stocking your pantry. These are helpful and expensive to do all at once. I really recommend starting with recipes where ingredients are readily available and adding on. My favorites so far include the Chai pancakes, and I did make the quinoa flour as she suggested and it turned out fine. The option was given to use maple syrup so I did as I had it. I also tried the sweet potato cereal, but only because I had some left over sweet potato. I used the Pitta version. It was strange, but tasty. I don't think I could eat it as breakfast but could have it as a lunch for sure. What else is good is Chia pudding. easy, different and yummy. Helps to have a water flosser for afterwards though - those chia seeds find the teensiest places to get caught. I have not made any of the lunch or dinner recipes. I am taking it one step at a time, eating breakfasts that may appeal to me ( and they do) In the next week I'll try some lunches. I feel that this would be such a change of tastes, over time one would probably become more acclimated to them. We have some exposure already so it's not as challenging. I recommend buying the hardcover. It's easier to navigate.",,1

Eat feel fresh is a good choice if you’re planning to make a big change to your lifestyle but it will also be helpful to those who are taking tiny steps and want to add a change-of-pace eating style from time to time.

If you’re going for the BIG change the book starts with the guidance and plan your need to recognize your personal needs for wellness. “Let it inspire you to make food choices that serve not only your body, but also your spirit."" --Deepak Chopra, MD.

The book is laid out starting with a short introduction of the philosophy behind the 5,000 year old tradition of Ayurveda in ancient India. Author Sahara Rose Ketabi feels Ayurveda provides us with the language to explain what our bodies already know and with this knowledge to customize recipes to meet our personal needs.

The bulk of the book consists of delicious recipes along with tons of enticing pictures. Here are the general contents along with a recipe I’ve tried.
1. Breakfast For Your Dosha (many tasty smoothies)
2. Six-Taste Bowls (Agada Rainbow Pad Thai Bowl)
3. Tridoshic Dinners (One Pot Curry)
4. Snacks & Sides (Zitakriya Cilantro Lime Rice)
5. Desserts (Balya Cinnamon Date Crispy Rice Bars – next to try)
6. Potions (Zarada Ginger Pumpkin Pie Latte)

576,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",5,restrictive but still delicious,Format: Hardcover,"This is a beautiful book. Sahara has done a fantastic job of presenting a lot of information that can be difficult to explain. It’s concise but comprehensive and incorporates her unique brand of Ayurveda. As for the recipes, there is some really delicious and nourishing food here.

I have to note that this is a very restricted way of eating. I’ve been gluten and mostly dairy free for the last 20 years so I’m not particularly inclined to limit myself considerably beyond that on a long term basis. Even for someone currently on a plant based diet, there are a lot of staples likely missing here. That being said, the cookbook can certainly be used as inspiration and many recipes can be adapted rather than following this as a strict diet. For the most part, the recipes I’ve tried don’t feel like they’re missing anything and are just delicious. The coconut curry sauce IS good enough to drink. For me, the Cauliflower Casserole is a version of a casserole you would only eat if there are a very large number of things you’re avoiding eating. It wasn’t necessarily bad, I just wouldn’t eat it if I didn’t have to. There is also a lot of certain ingredients like cauliflower and chickpeas. If you don’t like cauliflower, for example, you’d be much further restricted if you were following this way of eating strictly.

Lastly, I’m full time working mom, so many of these recipes are only feasible on the weekend for me. All that aside, I would highly recommend this to anyone as a great resource.",,1
577,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",4,Attractively presented,Format: Hardcover,"""Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook"" by Sahara Rose Ketabi is attractively presented. Author Ketabi takes time to explain various aspects of the Ayurvedic philosophy and practice before the recipes are listed which I liked. Depending on the reader's familiarity, the first 91 pages can be read or skipped.

I like how each recipe fits a certain aspect. Some recipes have ingredients that may not be easy to find (depending on one's location) but there are recipes that are less challenging in that way. The directions are easy to follow and again, the accompanying pictures are attractive and make the dishes look really good. Of the recipoes that I tried, I really like the grainfree noatmeal.

I think the only two downsides that make this cookbook something that I may not use much is: (1) some ingredients are not readily available for me and (2) no nutritional content listing. Due to health reasons, that second point is an important one. I know I could look up the nutritional content for each ingredient and put it all together but that is time consuming when time is a premium. That said, I think for those who have good access to the variety of ingredients and also are not wedded to nutritional content tables, this may be worth a look if one is into the Ayurvedic lifestyle. Again, this cookbook has a lot of helpful info and it is beautifully presented.",,1
578,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",5,Loving this book!,Format: Hardcover,"I really like the way Sahara wrote this book. I like the Ayurvedic take on food lifestyle but what I like more is how she has her own twist on it. She makes it more modern. It sounds like she's really done her research on this and put in a lot of time and effort and she did this for herself and this book was just a bonus for us. The Ayurvedic way was not meant to be vegan but she puts a vegan take on it which I think is nice. I am not vegan nor and I vegetarian but I am borderline high cholesterol. While I love meat I have to cut a lot of it out. I personally feel it's healthy to eat a little but these days people have way too much meat in their diet. I have a hard time finding plant based foods that aren't boring. You can throw butter on things and make it better but that's defeating my purpose. I might as well eat a rack of ribs! I feel like her book is a fresh take on a vegan-ish lifestyle. I'm working on becoming a weekday vegan and then being able to splurge, without over doing it on the weekends.",,1
579,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",5,Love this book!!!!!!!!,Format: Hardcover,"I completed a yoga teacher training program this summer, and I learned a bit about Ayurveda from there. Someone had mentioned the Highest Self Podcast (by Sahara Rose), and I started listening; a lot of what I learned about Ayurveda from her actually made sense!! That led me to buy her ""Idiot's Guide,"" which is a nice intro to Ayurveda, too. I was really excited when this book came out, however, as it is more of a cookbook (but still has so much more!).

I just finished reading through it this weekend, and WOW, I love it. Not only are the pictures stunning, but the information is so well-laid out. The introduction to Ayurveda has all the key points, plus some new details that weren't covered as much in her other book (such as listing foods that are alkalizing, etc). It really digs more into the food aspects, as it should, since it's a cookbook.

The recipes look great, and for most of them, they're broken up into three versions by Dosha. That's really cool, because they all have the same sort of ""base,"" but then you can change it up based on what you need to increase or pacify. I plan to make some of the recipes soon!

These items are discussed in the first three chapters of the book and I love how not only she describes in detail but in simple form what each item means. As we continue through the book she brings us into the kitchen (Chapter 4). She takes us through what we need for our spice rack, pantry and then brings us on what to eat for today to make prepping to just name of few of the topics. Each chapter is then divided into various sections from Breakfast for your Dosha, tasting bowls, dinners, snacks and sides dessert and potions (green juice, lattes and milk recipes.

What truly attracted me to the book - and the reason it will be a keeper - is the recipes. It's rare to find quality recipes that don't rely on additives, meat, dairy etc... in fact, I was shocked how similar the eating patterns are to what I already follow. Traditionally fermented foods are excluded yet we are avid fermenting freaks. We eat little/no animal products including dairy for exactly the same reasons mentioned in this book.

At the time, I was becoming very interested in diving deeper into understanding what sorts of food was best for my body and was interested in experimenting with my diet. This was, honestly, the first time in my 34 years that I started to care. I've never dieted. I love all food and ate what I wanted. No major issues really prompted me to look at my diet, except maybe the bit of belly fat I haven't seemed to get rid of, in a long time. Maybe my thyroid problem (do I really have to take pills everyday for the rest of my life?) I've had a pretty active, what I thought was a healthy-ish, lifestyle all my life. But looking at myself now, versus myself earlier this year before getting introduced to Ayurveda, my diet was all over the place! I was not eating best for my mind + body. At the same time, I started listening to Sahara's podcast (Highest Self Podcast) and fell in love with her message and everything she had to share, as I've been on a spiritual awakening path as well. Thank you Sahara for shining your light so brightly!

While her first book (the idiots guide) was a GREAT introduction to Ayurveda, and an amazing story how she even became the author for it... This new book... Eat Feel Fresh. WOW what a beauty! Seriously. You can tell that Sahara put all her love and soul into it, as the book truly shines! I haven't had a chance to make the recipes yet, but its such a beautiful book and the information is so clear and the recipes look unbelievably amazing. I can't wait to read it front to back. And back to front. I also LOVE that with this book, she adjusted the ancient Indian recipes and ingredients to be more worldly. I'd consider myself a foodie, and after living in NYC for 16 years (surrounded by any cuisine I can image) and also having traveled to 30+ countries, I like eating foods from around the world and mixing things up here and there. I'm very excited to dive into this book and play.

One more thing I would say for anyone also new to playing around with their diet (starting to learn about Ayuerveda) for the first time... just start somewhere. Start experimenting. Being mindful what you put into your body is sooo important. I see that now. But Ayurveda is also more than that. It's a stepping stone to being your highest, best self. It's been an incredible journey so far (and by no means I'm an ayuervedic expert yet). I'm still learning, still experimenting and exploring. Some changes I've gone through: Stopped drinking coffee and have way more energy than ever. I always thought I was a night owl, never thought this would happen but I've even become a morning person, getting so much done in the AM! Stopped eating red meat completely for about 3 months now, still eat chicken and fish. Trying to eat organic as much as possible. Cooking way more for myself (sometimes life can get a little crazy still though). I've also changed my relationship with alcohol... I used to drink a lot, now barely at all. I've realized there's SO much more to the world than the life I have been living, and while I've have a fun life, its SO exciting to explore it now in a more healthier and mindful way!

I was pretty confused. I am from India, living here in US now and was hoping for more recipes adapted for the daily lifestyle here but it seemed more like a memoir of a personal journey of discovery through food and photography.

I grew sad a little. It’s an attempt to take something raw, honest, meaningful and useful science and turn it into something glamorous and failing at it.

There are so many wonderful receipies from India if there was any real time spent in the kitchen to adapt for a contemporary take.

747,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",3,for people obsessed with food and conversations about food,Format: Hardcover,"I've gotta say it: this book isn't for those who are interested in moderately improving their health. It's more for health nuts who are a hair on the obsessive side. You may also be caught off guard (I was) by the piles of photographs of the author herself (gorgeous, but still...) usually treating other people in the photo as background/props. There are also piles of stunning photos of food that make the book almost worth buying for its photographic value alone. On the Ayurvedic note, I found the book almost-but-not-quite helpful. It had LOTS of background and talked about the 3 primary families (""doshas"" and I do recognize mine in there); but then it had another quiz about another aspect of ayurveda, then another quiz about yet ANOTHER angle to look at, and suddenly I'm 7 layers deep--OK, fine--but without any clear indication about how any of the recipes apply to me based on everything I've just read. A handful of recipes mention how to tweak them based on your dosha, but what about the other 15 pages of quizzes I just went through? It's much more ambiguous on that front, and I wish they'd have a chart (maybe in the appendix?) correlating the relationships between all those quizzes and the various recipes that are included. The recipes, as expected, regularly call for ingredients you've likely never heard of (even if you do lot of Indian / Asian / Thai cooking), and taste fine. As long as you're not into dairy--the author has decided to overrule traditional Ayurvedic medicine and substitute all of those with alternate versions (like almond or coconut milk). So perhaps take it with a grain of salt if you're interested in authentic Ayurvedic medicine.

So all told this book is stunning for its photographic value (of food, the author, food, the author, etc.) semi-interesting in terms of its Ayurvedic knowledge, and moderately helpful in terms of giving you some new recipes to try. It's not bad to have in your kitchen, but not complete enough to really use on its own. So don't stop here... but if you're the audience for this book, there's a good chance you'll have a vast collection of food-related books anyway.",28 people found this helpful,0

It was a gift so... shame on me. It just feels like I bought something used for my friend! I don't have the book anymore because I gave it to her, so I did not take pictures. She did not want to return it and kept it, but I was really disappointed.",,0

757,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",2,"Beautiful, but spreads misinformation",Format: Hardcover,"This book is lovely, and the author charming, and the recipes delicious-looking. However, as someone who formally studied Ayurveda, this book spreads misinformation and inaccuracies regarding chakras, how they are affected by food, and other subtle inaccuracies regarding the affect of foods on the body-- her substitutions for dairy, for example, are not 1:1 in terms of how they will act on the body, medicinally, the same way traditional dairy products would. Additionally, I do not see her credentials as an Ayurvedic practitioners anywhere. She states she ""studied Ayurveda in India"" and read some books by the big guys, like Lad and Chopra. I'd like to see her credentials, and these inaccuracies make me doubt her suitability for active practice.",14 people found this helpful,0
758,"Eat Feel Fresh: A Contemporary, Plant-Based Ayurvedic Cookbook",3,More than just a cookbook,Format: Hardcover,"Eat Feel Fresh is an interesting take on a cookbook.

The book has less recipes that one would expect from a cookbook, in fact a large portion of the book is dedicated to the spiritual science behind different ingredients and foods. There is talk of chakras, and food's acidity, and different spices and more. The book covers many topics for those who want to feel better both physically and mentally based on diet.

The recipes that are included are an eclectic mix, but a lot of the ingredients are not staples of most local supermarkets. I tried the lentil shepherds pie recipe and it was pretty good, if a bit bland, but that just might be becuase my diet has more processed foods than I'm sure the author eats in a typical day, so I am probably not as sensitive to different flavors on my palette. The recipe was easy to follow and straightforward.

I'm not knocking the book for having natural and earthy recipes, I'm just giving it a slightly lower rating since it contains so few recipes. I think that describing it as a cookbook is a little misleading. It's part cookbook and part education book.

All in all...learn about food and learn how to cook it.",11 people found this helpful,0
