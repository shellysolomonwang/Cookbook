1,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,5,"Feeling Full, Inspired, Healthy and Losing Weight! Thanks Rocco!!",Format: Hardcover,"I purchased this book hesitantly because of the not so great reviews. I started this 4 days ago and absolutely love it. Yes, you do have to order a lot of the ingredients (ie: Shirataki Noodles (yum!!) and Egg White Powder etc) on Amazon but they arrive very quickly and it saves you time from trying to find them in stores. The book is very easy to read and understand and it provides you with a shopping list for every 7 days including daily meal plans and super quick, easy and delicious recipes. So far, I am down 5 lbs. I seriously love the recipes and how easy they are. I make enough for everyone in my family at dinner time and then eat what I need to eat, according to the book, throughout the day. My kids and husband love the recipes too. Yes, this is going to be a more expensive shopping trip but it is worth it. Its worth the little time you put into it and its worth making the healthy change and its worth it to see real weight loss results. So the pictures are pink in color, who cares...Some books don't even have pictures!! The food is delicious and that's all that matters to me.

My complaints:
The grocery shopping list is very very long (lots of produce items ...like a page long) and it took me forever to find and get everything from the grocery store...I got somewhat frustrated and am not looking forward to going back next week. I did however just use my printer to make a copy of the shopping list so that I could cross things off as I went
I am not a big fan of the every morning Chocolate Protein Shake. I think I might add some vanilla extract and/or some agave nectar to it because it tastes like unsweetened chocolate powder and its so biter.
The daily meals don't have page numbers to the recipes next to them. So, I have to search for them and write the page number next to each meal so that it makes my life easier.
I ended up ripping out all the recipes by category and then stapling them together so that I could easily have them on hand, instead of searching through the book for everything. I also ripped out all the shopping lists and daily meal plans. This made everything much more organized and easy for me.

My YAY's:
Every meal is super fast to make
Every meal is filling and I never feel hungry
Almost every meal is super delicious...I am serious!
I can make them to take with me in the car or wherever I go...very easy
Don't have time to make your meal? There are substitution options like Lean Cuisine etc
My entire family loves it
You eat breakfast, 2 snacks, lunch, dinner and dessert
I feel amazing and happy and inspired
My body and mind are changing for the better
I am on the road to weight loss success and learning how to eat healthy for my future",27 people found this helpful,1
2,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,5,Lost 10 pounds in the first 2 weeks and am still losing after 2 months.,Format: Hardcover,"5 stars because this book works.

I never thought I'd be able to regularly eat less than 1000 calories a day and not go crazy. My wife and I tried this diet out as soon as the book arrived. You just can't argue with the results ... I lost 10 pounds (and a waist size) within the first 2 weeks. This book completely adjusted my attitude and way I view my diet.

Granted, the diet as written in the book is not easy (at least initially):
* The shopping is hard (and expensive) as some of the items are very difficult to find or are only available at ridiculously expensive stores (like Whole Foods) ... additionally, there are mistakes in some of the shopping lists (which I hope they fix for the second printing)

* The cooking is (initially) hard as there are ALOT of new recipes to learn ... especially for the first week. However, since most recipes only involve 4-5 ingredients, they are actually very simple and quick once you get used to it. By the end of the first month, I had cooked everything and preparing meals was a lot simpler/quicker than my diet before this book.

* I still had cravings. But since that's part of any diet, I don't hold that against Rocco ... it's my own fault for getting used to eating large quantities of bad food. However, the cravings I've had on this diet were a lot less than any other diet I've been on. Also, since my target weight of 250 lb is much larger than the average person, Rocco does state that the diet isn't optimized for someone my size. However, if you read the diet portion carefully, you'll note that Rocco recommends supplementing with an extra, healthy snack. For me, I added the broccoli+humus snack every night and that kept my cravings at a manageable level.

* After about a week, I started feeling really, really good. I'm not sure if it was the weight dropping off, or the nutritional balance of the diet (or a combination of both), but I just feel a lot healthier and more alert.

Once my wife and I started the second month, we wrote our own meal plan based on his. The major changes we made were:
1.) Swapped recipes we hated for recipes we really enjoyed. Goodbye rutabaga (*yeck*) ... hello Salisbury Steak at least once a week.

2.) Swapped recipes that we found difficult or time-consuming for simpler recipes we didn't mind regularly eating. Example: while the Green Monkey is delicious, the prep and clean-up time are astronomically higher than cheese & apples, or broccoli & humus.

3.) Swapped recipes with expensive or hard-to-find ingredients with recipes with common/inexpensive ingredients. I can't think of a specific example at this second, but this really made shopping a lot faster and cheaper. Our weekly grocery bill was cut in half and our total shopping trip time was down to less than an hour (plus we could get away with going to only one store).

4.) Swapped expensive ingredients with cheaper ingredients. Sliced turkey from the deli case is roughly $12/lb where we shop, but a roast chicken @ Costco is $5 and yields roughly 30oz of meat. And frankly, I think the roast chicken tastes much better. Another example was swapping the mango (in the ""rice pudding"" for whatever fruit was in-season / on-sale).

5.) Swapped in recipes that could be doubled. We couldn't find a small enough bok choy for a half portion of the Turkey Stir-fry recipe, and we hate wasting food. So every other week, we make a normal portion (which counts as double if only 2 people are eating), and save the other 2 servings for a night of the week that we both work. The tea is another great example (since I find zesting half a lemon annoying). My wife also does this with several of the lunch soups and salads as she feels that a double portion is about as easy to make as a normal portion.

6.) Pencil in the right amounts on each page. My wife took a few minutes after we got the book and penciled in the correct ingredient amounts for 2 people. It took her less than an hour (converting from fractions of a Tablespoon to Teaspoon is not always clear), but we don't screw the recipes up anymore.

... granted, we are now eating less variety, but identifying our favorite, easy dishes and having them once a week (or twice a week in case of left-overs from the double-up trick) makes this diet a lot less time- and $$$-intensive. In order to keep the calorie count accurate, we ranked our favorite meals and then matched them with compatible snacks and desserts that fit within the daily calorie targets. We wrote the ingredients on the back and use them to quickly create the shopping list for the week.

So yes, this isn't a magic cure or a perfect, effortless solution. But no diet is, and anything worth doing will take some effort. Also, can you really put a price tag on getting your health/figure back?

If you are serious about weight loss and enjoy cooking, you really need to at least give this a try for 2 weeks.",111 people found this helpful,1
3,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,5,So far I've had AMAZING results!,Format: Hardcover,"I started on this diet on Monday and as of today (Wed 2 full diet days later) I have lost 5.4 pounds. The food is good. The shopping is difficult because you have to find items you have probably never bought before. All of the items on the first week's shopping list were more than I was used to spending at the grocery store. If you live in a small town like I do, you will probably have to head to the big city grocery store to get several of the items on the list. I have like most of the food on the menu. If I don't like it or don't want to try it I have just substituted something of equal nutritional values (either from the book or the internet). My husband and seventeen year old daughter are also doing this with me. They too have dropped weight quickly. My husband has dropped 3 pounds the first 2 days (he's been drinking wine at night) and my daughter who is a dedicated basketball player (so she exercises a lot) has lost 8 pounds in 2 days! We have all felt a little hungry but nothing so bad that we could wait for the next meal or snack. All of us are lovers of food and big eaters but this hasn't really felt like a diet bc the food has been good and filling. You get dessert every evening! You are expected to eat every 3 hours (daughter and I have done, hubby has not). My husband has been walking for 20 minutes a day I have not added any exercise, yet. The book does say you should do 30 minutes a day six days a week. Maybe I would have lost more if I had been exercising like my daughter. You have to give up all sodas (diet, too). That has been the hardest part for me. All recipes are quick to make (within 30 mins).",12 people found this helpful,1
4,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,5,Great results and creates awareness,Format: Hardcover,"I don't like to write reviews the moment I buy something like this, because I would rather see what results I get before I post.

I have been following the recipes from this book since January 20th of this year, and have lost a total of 24 pounds. For the first 3 weeks, I loosely followed the diet, the approach, as I stayed at around 1200 calories per day. On my 4th week, I started following the book and I can say that the fear that I had of feeling sluggish, tired, and unmotivated due to the low amount of calories, has not happened. I have been exercising regularly and have felt great before and after every run, or every exercise that I do. I have played basketball with friends and have not once felt that I am going to faint, or that I should not be playing.

The reality is that so far, it has worked for me. There is one thing that I have to say about the book which led me to the title of my review. The book to me has not been an end all, be all book. By reading carefully what the book says, I have become aware that I can tailor a meal plan for myself (due to my schedule), and still continue losing weight. The book created awareness that there are other ingredients that I have never used, or seen. Also, it has made me aware that exercising is key to any diet.

Folks, there are no magic pills, no magic anything. I have been dieting for the better part of 35 years and have lately learned that I have to eat well, not diet; and I have to exercise and have an active lifestyle. All those crazy fad diets, cleanses, etc, which say you can lose weight and not exercise, will end up hurting you in the long run, by creating a false sense of security.

This book is an educational tool. Look at it and try to read into what Chef Rocco says. If you don't like something, change it...it is that simple.

Again, the results for me are there. I feel happy and healthy, 24 pounds later. Still need to lose another 23 pounds, so I'll post an update once I get there...",13 people found this helpful,1
5,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,5,Chock full of info and great recipes,Format: Kindle Edition,"This book is very well laid out and well written. It is packed with helpful and practical steps anyone can take to lose a pound a day. He lays everything out in great detail, and includes several recipes as well to put everything into practice.
Most importantly, you need to follow the instructions and advice. It is not difficult to do, but people like to find excuses not to do these things. It could be fear of change or lack of confidence, but if you really want to change and lost the weight, you need to put a bit of work into it. This book makes it easy, but you still have to follow the steps and take action.
I definitely recommend it - if you are committed to weight loss, this book will get you to where you want to be. It will show you the steps and tell you how to get there, you just need to walk down the path.",5 people found this helpful,1
6,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,5,Awesome Cuisine; Meal Plan Delivers,Format: Hardcover,"I tried this plan for 28 days as outlined in the book. Good news: the recipes are absolutely some of the most delicious, easy to prepare dishes I have ever made! Great news: I lost 7 pounds the first 7 days! Bad news: I lost only 3 more pounds the remaining 21 days. If you are someone wanting to lose a moderate amount of weight in a short period of time safely, this is the plan for you. The recipes are simple and I was already familiar with a good number of the ingredients. I love that the strawberry shake and strawberries with yogurt cream desserts are sweet but low-calorie and non-fattening! I even made the majority of these recipes for my family since the serving is four per recipe and they were enjoyed by all. However, since I had more than 10 pounds to lose, I chose to move on to another plan which would give me the consistent results I need. My only caveat is the use of artificial sweeteners. I chose to replace them with stevia. I will continue to use these recipes even after my weight loss is complete as they are just that darn delicious! I am very happy I purchased this book and now am a Rocco fan. Keep the great food coming!",3 people found this helpful,1
7,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,5,"Customize it, and you will own this diet like a boss",Format: Kindle Edition,"I'm 9 days into this diet, and so far I am down 7 pounds. I am not a fad dieter, so I don't have a lot of experience in this category. A lot of people also complained of the ingredients on the list, so I will preface my review by saying I like to keep healthy, eat clean when possible, but I don't go over the top with it. Here are my observations and advice about this diet:

- Yes, the groceries will make you rack up a pretty penny, but it will be worth it. You will also be buying a lot of items which will last you a long time. I split mine in half, and spent about $200 for week #1. I'm in week 2, and I think I'm going to be able to keep going with what I bought last week well into next week.

- Give the diet a week, and learn what you like and what you don't. Then spend time to make your own customized meal plans, using this diet's recipes and calorie counts. You can then make your own shopping lists, and customize the diet to the things you love the most. And use the ingredients you maybe didn't use in the previous week because you didn't care for the recipe.

- Yes, some of the ingredients are going to be foreign. Here's where it's kind of exciting -- challenge your taste buds! If your local supermarket offers a ""Shop for You"" feature, utilize it! I did this for the first time, specifically for this diet. Someone else ran around the store looking for the items, I just went and paid for it. Or you could just purchase off of Amazon. Either way, this really shouldn't be too much of an obstacle.

- If you work during the day, use the easy-to-carry snacks like shakes. Utilize some of his suggested name-brand frozen foods for a fast lunch, if need be.

- If you don't like some of the ingredients (low fat; fat free; sugar free; etc.), skip them, add your own (I add full-fat cheese), but modify the amount to still make the calories. Or go over, and it likely won't set you back, within reason.

This diet is truly awesome so far. Seeing the progress on the scale makes me keep going, whereas I've dropped off of other diets immediately, just because progress took time. This is a really great way to get yourself motivated and into the groove -- all the while, eating lots of fruits and veggies. The food is so healthy!",9 people found this helpful,1
8,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,4,A lot of good stuff in there,Format: Hardcover,"I've been on the ""Pound a Day Diet"" for about a month, and I've lost about 12 lbs. So, it's not really a pound a day after the first week, but if you read the introduction, he does say that. I've gotten a lot out of the book. Some great finds include:

1.) The shirataki noodles, which are a no-carb, high-fiber asian vegetable noodle. These are super helpful when added to soups and stirfries.

2.) He also got me way more into kale, which is a terrific food. He offers a lot of different ways to cook ingredients so the flavors and textures complement each other. I now find myself chopping up kale and ading it to all sorts of things and really enjoying it.

3.) I thought I didn't like grapefruit. You'll be eating it every day on the diet and it's another huge help for getting vitamins, hydration, and feeling of fullness between meals and only 28 calories per whole fruit. Get the ruby grapefruit, It tastes sweeter and is more nutritious than the lighter model. This item is one I would buy at a Whole Foods.

Once you go through all the recipes, you start to understand how foods can be easily combined to create new dishes, and you get a much better idea of how to control your caloric intake, while keeping up the nutritional content of the food.

The first week is daunting, because the shopping list seems enormous, and a lot of the things on the list may be unfamiliar to you (they certainly were to me.) Please be aware that the shopping lists are actually enough for four people, although he states they're for two. So if you're doing the diet alone (like me) then only buy 1/4 of what's on the list, and make sure you get the bulk of it at a more inexpensive grocery store. If you shopfor it all at Whole Foods or its equivalent, you'll have a very large bill at the end of your shopping trip.

I will also point out that you will be drinking a chocolate protein shake every morning for the first month. A lot of the unfamiliar items, e.g. psyllium husks, triple fiber, monk fruit extract, are used in this recipe. Don't be daunted. The shake really helps you stay full to snack time. It's one of the best finds in the diet.

I'm not crazy about the fake sugar, but in the beginning, if you're a sweets eater, these snacks and desserts can really get you over the hump. You can always swap out a more vegetable-based snack for these and get even more nutrition.

I really recommend this diet. It will give you a lot of tools once you're off it and if you're like me, getting those inital few pounds off quickly is a real motivator.",5 people found this helpful,1
9,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,5,"A cook book with weight loss benefits for home,office,and non dieting family members",Format: Hardcover,"My husband and I are both right around 50. After gaining unwanted pounds, we both decided it was time to loose. I was excited by this book philosophy of needing to see results to create incentive. Sure enough, we are loosing right on schedule after only a week. That's all well and good, but here's the best part: This food is good! I have done other diet plans successfully, but the food and recipes became monotonous and bland. Once I reached my goal weight, I quickly returned to old habits and foods with more (unhealthy) flavor. The difference? This book is created by a chef, whereby other plans created by nutritionists just don't compare in taste. And after all, shouldn't we enjoy our food?

I am not a health nut. The thought of protien smoothies, frankly, grossed me out. However, I was ready to try it for the sake of my weight loss goal. The chocolate breakfast smoothie wasn't bad! I discovered, however, that on days when I play tennis, it didn't work for me. Guess what?! The plan is flexible, so I have the breakfast sandwich instead and it's perfect. Then the crazy thing happened.... Today, I craved the chocolate smoothie. WHAAAAAT.!?!

As to the lunch and dinner meals, absolutely scrumptious. Let's be honest, everyone has different tastes. There are some recipes we prefer more than others and that's ok. If we dodn't care for one recipe listed on the menu, I substitute one that we prefer. I find one that is close in calorie count and enjoy. Lordy, once you try the chicken enchiladas that take 5 seconds to make in the MICROWAVE!!! So fast, easy and to die for!

I am a snacker. That's how I put on my weight. On this plan, I'm eating every 2 1/2 hours. I'm snacking my way to losing weight. Again, some snacks in menu didn't satisfy me, especially in the afternoons. I learned which ones filled me up and use those. Again, from the woman who doesn't like smoothies, the banana smoothie and almond smoothies are so filling and delicious. I also like that it takes me a while to drink them, so it helps with my old ""boredom"" snacking problem. Honesty check...green smoothly not my thing and that's ok.

We have a 14 year old son who does not need to loose weight. He eats what we eat and I add some sides or increase his portion size. I'm not cooking two different meals.

Shopping? Ok, a little cumbersome at first, but like anything new, it gets easier with experience. I know where everything is after one week and just not a big deal. Cost? Your first trip will be a biggie, but a lot of things you buy the first week will last you for weeks to come. You just have to commit to restocking your pantry/fridge with the new lifestyle.

Bottom line, fantastic healthy food in correct portions that work well for those who work from home or from the office (most meals are for 4, so leftovers are packed up for lunches at the office). Oh yeah, you loose weight as a side effect! What could be better? Thanks Chef!!",9 people found this helpful,1

We are not hungry, but if that ever happens we know what to eat to help and not hinder. I have been introduced to some new foods, most I like and will add permanently….some not so much, so we substitute an acceptable alternative.

This is coming from an seasoned chef who has amazing food around him constantly. That is why I purchased this book because I always wondered how do chefs maintain their health. I started to understand my own challenges with food and exercise as I read his personal challenges. I am a working Mom with a family and no time for myself. I read the book and what impressed me is how Rocco laid out the information. I can put together a week's worth of food using the meal plans. It has the shopping lists! Whatever I could not get at the grocery store, it is available on Amazon. Easy. If I could not cook then I buy the ready made version which is also in the book. That was a great idea. I try not to do the ready made option often but it is a big help that it is there. My husband and I are doing this together so he has helps with the shakes and shopping. Very easy to organize for both of us.The recipes are not difficult but some of the food combinations are really good. Who would of thought to put grapefruit and fennel with salmon? Grapefruit with spiced sugar? We are doing pretty good so far. Can't wait for the spring to go out to exercise. Rocco's book is our go to food guide and the start to our new and healthy lifestyle.

13,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,5,Great for Beginner or Expert Cooks,Format: Kindle Edition,"I got this book the day it was released as a pre-order and can't say I am plummeting pounds YET. I took time to read the whole book...it was fascinating to me. Than I tested some of the recipes (a few in each category)for my husband and myself....all were very good. Now I am planning to start my first full week Monday.

The things I love about this book is that anyone can do this. I have every book that Rocco has written. All are worn and grease stained from use. I am first generation Italian and love to cook (at home and at work). I have found that some recipes in his original ""Eat This"" line can be slightly advanced and intimidating for novice cooks (told to me by friends I have lent my books to) but this book is written with easy quick recipes that use things like instant pudding and prepped at the store items. They use the microwave (I am not a food snob) and are easy to make. So if you shy away from professional chef cookbooks give this one a whirl. You end up with made at home chef quality tasting food that is great tasting but easy to make. It looks like once you build up your pantry you will not need to buy every thing each week so try not to freak by the grocery list. I had many of the items in my pantry already.

I was never hungry, and the meals were scrumptious! You will not feel deprived of taste or food. I will continue to make many of them in the future.
It is a bit expensive the first week, due mostly to the protein drink ingredients, and much of the veggies that will last longer than week one.

6TBS southwestern egg beaters, 1 piece fat free pepper jack cheese, 2 pieces turkey bacon, 2 pieces whole wheat or whole grain toast with low sugar jelly. Lunch is ground turkey with fire roasted tomatoes, steamed broccoli and cauliflower. Dinner is chicken breast cutlets (I use Braggs amino acids instead of soy) and chinese five spice (just a pinch or two sprinkled over chicken) and frozen mixed vegetables. Water all day.

20,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,4,Not bad,Format: Kindle Edition,"Love this but it is expensive if you are on the go like me. The basic concept of increasing protein and decreasing sugar is fab. A lot of healthy snacking on this plan but again the regimen is strict and should be followed as closely as possible. I did see weight loss on the scale, and inches off my waist. The only problem I ran into was the grocery bill. I bought a lot of lean cuisine as the book suggest for substitution however the sodium intake in LC meals and WW meals is unbelievable. I may return to this diet at some point when I have more time to concentrate on cooking meals instead of using the WW and LC meals.",2 people found this helpful,1
21,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,4,inspired to eat healthier,Format: Hardcover,"I always liked Rocco's shows and videos on cooking so I purchased this book to lose those stubborn 7 lbs. I added the past few years once I hit 40. Reading the book before seeing the recipes was enough to inspire me to want to just eat better and lose that weight.

I will say, however, I have some questions. Like grapefruits, I love them just as is but by adding the topping is that part of the weight loss or can I do without? I love to cook even though I work full time. I just feel a family that eats together stays together etc. My kids all like to cook too which I love. So I was kinda surprised to read canned salmon. Rocco, I'm assuming fresh is best right? Again, not sure if following it exactly will help with the weight loss though so I don't know! Can I buy fresh salmon instead? I never ate canned!

Also, I can't make smoothies or use a blender during the day bc I'm at work. Might be too noisy for everyone lol. Can I make these ahead of time? Will they stay ok for a few hours? I really want this to work. I live on long island and there are many healthy food stores I'm sure I can get the ingredients from.

Anyway, I'm mostly impressed with reading these reviews and Rocco actually responding. I seriously respect that and see that he really does have a passion for this. I don't think most authors would bother to do that. So for that alone, thanks Rocco! And for the inspiration and for being so cute! Ha ha",One person found this helpful,1

67,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,5,Real recipes with real food offering real results!,Format: Kindle Edition,"I had the pleasure of meeting Rocco prior last November and he gave me some super low calorie recipes for what is traditionally the highest calorie meal of the year - Thanksgiving. My 27 year old daughter was with me and we were inspired to try the recipes for ourselves. They were delicious! That in turn inspired her to follow Rocco's Pound A Day Book. She has lost roughly 20 pounds (5 pounds in 5 days and the rest came off more gradually) But she takes pride and ownership in each meal she prepares with FRESH ingredients. Does it take time and commitment? Of course it does. But its worth it. She has made me dinner on several occasions and all have been excellent. The book offers detailed recipes and also quicker alternatives for those not inclined to prepare each dish with fresh ingredients. More importantly, the book has given my daughter a recipe for a better, healthier life. She looks beautiful, feels energized and empowered and for a book to offer that kind of inspiration and guidance - what better endorsement can one give? Nobody should expect to lose a pound a day indefinitely. That would be impossible and unhealthy. But for a jump start to a NEW life - this book delivers what it promises to. I recommend it.

89,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,4,Good book and Great meals.,Format: Hardcover,"My wife and I started this diet last week and we are today on day 7 of the diet. So far in the seven days I have dropped a little over 7lbs in those days. I have to admit though that weight was not in body fat but mostly in water weight. On day 6, I went and had a biometric scan completed from my dietician and from an older scan it showed I had dropped 5.5lbs of water and only dropped .2lbs of body fat from my previous scan.

Secondly it is expensive for the first week. The laundry list of items that you have to buy are daunting. We found that even though the grocery list states for two people, we have a lot of stuff still left over from week one. It said to buy two whole chickens, which we did and on day 7 we still have a whole chicken in the fridge. So unless you are actually feeding for 4 people you might end up with extra food. The other thing we found is the grocery list is a little complicated. In week two, on page it calls for 1 under ripe banana, then on another page it tells you to buy 2 under ripe bananas, so does that mean we need three in total?

Once we are done with week two, I will post and update. I will also get another biometric scan completed to see if I've dropped more body fat or just losing more water.",3 people found this helpful,1

At first I was overwhelmed by the shopping list because in my small town many items are not available. If you don't want to prepare everything from scratch, or the items are not available to you, he gives brand names of prepared items that you can use in replacement of his recipes and they are pretty commonly available. I decided to go through the menus and choose just things I knew I would like for the first week, which helped with the grocery bill. As I go along I will try many of the recipes. I really appreciated the weekly journal he included in the book and have made copies to keep records. The diet is easy to understand and he explains the benefits of each food item. I totally understand the concept of this program because it is very similar to one that the University of Iowa used and may still use to either add weight or take off weight for it's athletic program, the difference being a Medditerranean based diet as the heart of the plan. Be sure and READ the book, not just go straight to the diet section so you understand the concept. Thanks Rocco for sharing your plan with us. Well done.

276,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,5,Good clean eating that is sustainable!,Format: Hardcover,"So, I will begin with the disclosure that I have lost over 150 pounds and purchased this book recently for the recipe ideas and not the goal of losing any more weight. I saw a segment on the View and realized that his program matches up perfectly with how I lost weight, and subsequently I purchased the book to add in some new options for my dinner table.

I love the book! His entire approach works- been there and done that as this is what I followed to lose the weight. If you are looking to lose weight this will work for you without feeling half starved all the time. Somewhere around 6 weeks of eating like this I lost my killer sweet tooth, so be patient- your pallette will change, these types of recipes will become second nature, and you will not crave high sugar or high fat type options anymore.

So what I love: The recipes in general call for a short list of ingredients to prepare and also are prepared many times in under 15 minutes. I am a very lazy cook and a total workaholic- so fast and healthy is what I need. These are recipes that even I can handle :) His book also spells out a daily eating plan for a month with recipes. If I was using this as a diet this would be a huge bonus, as I would not have to constantly search for things that will work. His shopping list is very specific and will put all needed ingredients in your house for each week. It is true that it is a very long list of ingredients, however, on any given week there are many items that you likely already have in your pantry. He does call for a few ingredients that are not typical, such as monk fruit extract. In my humble opinion you can handle this one of two ways- substitute out your current favorite sweetner or just try it. If you feel that the ingredients are expensive, then I would implore you to consider just how obscenely expensive it is to be obese and all of the costs associated with that. I bet if you sit down and think about how much you will save by not going through drive-thrus, getting crap food to snack on, improved health benefits, etc. it will more than make up for it.

On a side note- I probably will not take the time to prepare the smoothie/protein shake recipes. I use Premier Protein available at the big box stores. Slightly less calories, all the protein, ready to drink, and has a good vitamin profile. I said I was lazy, right?

282,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,5,Best book I ever purchased!!,Format: Hardcover,"After reading the reviews I purchased the book with a vast amount of trepidation. Having several friends who followed this diet and lost between 50 and 85 pounds in a relatively short period of time spurred my curiosity. At first the food list was overwhelming but with determination I shopped and stocked everything into my pantry. I began the diet 3 days later and was thrilled with the rapid weight loss. The consistent weight loss encouraged me to stick with the diet. There was not a day on this diet I was ever hungry. Within the first couple of weeks the diet got easier and then easier as each week went by. I lost 70 pounds in 86 days. I no longer have high blood pressure nor am I fearful of getting heart disease which plagued my Mom's family. I could not be happier nor healthier!

295,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,5,Easy to Follow,Format: Hardcover,"Rocco’s new book is an outstanding easy to read and commit to lifestyle changing book. I ran around to three different stores yesterday to get the book and am so glad I did. The book is completely relatable, Rocco gives his own personal struggle with weight which inspired me to do the same. Rocco does not preach in the book, but offers two great phases to reach your goal weight. It is also wonderful to have a body mass index (BMI) chart in the book to get an idea where you should be. I absolutely love the shopping lists and was able to purchase everything at two grocery stores, took less than two hours to obtain the ingredients to lose a pound a day!

I had today off of work and was able to get my meals prepared for the week. While I was prepping I was watching Season 5 of Top Chef and can truly see the transformation that Rocco has made in his life. When you look at Rocco on his newest show, Restaurant Divided, you can see the transformation he has made in his life. I too, have grown from size to size and didn’t realize how big I was until I was buying XL shirts and feeling bad about myself. I am excited to get going on the diet and get back into a M shirt, like Rocco. Rocco is an inspiration and I cannot wait to get to day 28 and start phase 2.

I am familiar with all the ingredients in this book, so no problem getting them all. I love that they are all 4 serving meals, as I have a family of 3, and that leaves me with leftovers to take to work the next day so I'm not buying unhealthy food at work. I really don't like some of the ingredients, but I can live with them because their are a lot of other ingredients to cover up the taste of some of the items I don't like. I just started this way of eating, I don't call it a diet, because I fail at diets, it's a new way of eating. So far my family loves it. I hope by time I make all these recipes you come out with a second book, because I love variety. I recommend this book to anyone that loves to cook and cook with variety and flavor. I'm hoping to lose the weight, but if I don't lose the weight, at least I'm eating healthy, which is a great start. Keep up the good work Rocco!!",2 people found this helpful,1

We have tried something similar but not as good as this is going to be, My Husband and I are HOPEFUL this is going to help and be easy to do since I have to cook carefully because he's a Type 2 diabetic, so I do my best to cook healthy since 2007.

I have recommended it already to some and may just buy a couple books for our Sons and their wives. One has a Desk Job and other a Truck Driver. One eats healthy as can other does his best on the road I believe.

To be honest upfront it was a lot of work because I did not have many ingredients in my pantry. Plus, I made the choice to cook most of the meals even though I have a little one and work full-time. That being said, I've learned a lot of new substitutes that I'll definitely use in the future and my husband and I have seen immediate results! The food is really surprisingly delicious and the menu plans have helped me with an issue I've had during past diets - getting enough protein and water. I was very worried my husband would only last a day because he's an Italian who loves his pasta and portions, but he has been shockingly extremely satisfied with the meals. Title holds true so far - I'm down 3lbs. Great short term plan for quick results that don't feel dangerous or shock your system.

I hardly ever cook and frankly was not raised in a nutritionally balanced environment and i work all of the time!! I decided to try this out because i wanted to enter middle-age gracefully and feel and look better than ever which i can honestly say i do now!! I learned so much about food, and now i love going to the market and preparing all of rococo's mouth watering recipes. A whole new world has opened up to me.

We have stuck to the menu items and have found everything very tasty. I do add an extra snack of fruit to my husbands day since 850 calories for him is a bit tough. Fortunately since he is doing it with me I only have to cut the recipes in half but I completely agree that having ALL of the recipes being for 4 servings is pretty ridiculous. I will keep going with it but feel that after going through one week I may be able to be smarter in shopping for subsequent weeks. Some of the alternate options may be the way to go!,,1

I coupled it all with a moderate work out routine. And in 30 days I lost 20 pounds! Not only have I lost significant weight and am now at optimal weight, I look 10 years younger. I've returned to a physique that I no longer thought was possible. I am 46 years old, 5' 9"" and weigh in at 162 fit pounds. The book makes eating and preparing foods fun, simple and informative.

After reading some of the reviews that had questions about the diet, I wanted to give feedback and perspective from someone who has seen Rocco's program work in real life. I am a medical doctor, a certified nutrition specialist, author of Cleanse Your Body, Clear Your Mind, and I've worked with hundreds of patients every year who are seeking weight loss and improved health. I've had the good fortune of working with a number of patients who have followed Rocco's program. The patients came to see me to get blood work and they wanted to work with a physician, just in case they had a medical question or issue. These patients definitely lost weight, ""when they couldn't lose it before"", and they felt, ""better than they've felt in years"".

Rocco's book helps you to jump start your weight loss program, and he teaches you how to keep the weight off.
- his program is extremely easy to follow
- his description of Phase 1, how to begin is clear and concise. The only thing easier would be if he cooked the food for you (and I bet he'd be happy to do that if you asked!)
- his suggestion to eat 850 calories from protein and veggies for 5 days during phase 1 is effective and in my opinion safer than many of the radical only juice cleanses many are following today.
- his shopping guide includes easy to source foods like, ""Red grapefruit, green beans, zucchini"", and many other options that expand your palate for long term success.
- his recipes couldn't be easier, like ""Egg white omelet with pico de gallo (spicy tomato and onions and can be purchased at the grocery store)""
- he uses healthy ingredients that are easy to find at the grocery store and some innovative healthy grocery store ingredients that are easy to start incorporating into your meal plan to make your meals delicious and fun to make.
- he provides valuable and easy to use resources for learning how to choose nutritious low calorie options for long term success.

Rocco is a chef and nutrition junky! This book will help you lose weight, feel great and teaches you to cook delicious, healthy meals for long term success. All you need is the will to expand your food options. Rocco's book teaches you how to do it! And, pretty soon, you'll enjoy healthy cooking and healthy eating so much, you'll want to share your success and Rocco's book with all your friends.

There are very few recipes in this book that I would say have real food. Most have artificial sweeteners in them, egg powder, protein powder, shirataki noodles, xantham gum, psyllium husk powder, etc. Who has these things in their pantry? They don't seem like real food to me. His ready made substitutes are also things that are not readily available where I live. I don't want to spend a ton of money ordering artificial ingredients from Amazon just to try some of these recipes. I have been cutting back on processed foods and this seems like a step backwards.

My first shock was the incredible laundry list of food needed the first week. I looked up some of the ingredients and check on Amazon to get some idea of what some of the more exotic items like Monk Fruit in the Raw cost. In addition, I was trying to figure out how I was going to have enough room in my pantry and refrigerator for all the ingredients on his list for the week! It might be a wonderful program, but just to prepare to set it all up and to follow it is overwhelming as well as expensive. I was looking forward to making some of the smoothies, but was stopped in my tracks when I found the they all had sugar-free instant puddings in them (I don't use artificial sweetners). As someone said in another review, I am the only one that would be on this program and everything is for 2 to 4 people.

This may be a great program for someone whose whole family would be on it, has the capacity to get all the ingredients and has the money to pay for it all. Some of the recipes are great and I will certainly make use of adding them to a program that fits my life better. Unfortunately, I will have to continue my search.",814 people found this helpful,0
374,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,2,"Metabolic, Smettabolic...",Format: Hardcover,"I so wanted to like this book. I saw him cooking with Stacy from what not to wear and she was raving about his healthy vegi hamburger.

1. The book layout is hard to follow. For the first 10 minutes in the daily meal plan I thought the calorie count was the page number and realized that I had too schlep through the entire book and write each recipe page number next to it.

2. I too thought the recipes would be chef inspired, but they aren't. They are basically the same type of stuff we've see a thousand times in every other book except he adds a lot of processed foods and stuff you can't find in a super market. Do I really need a chef to help me make a chocolate smoothie and a grapefruit.

3. There is no magic to this system, metabolic, smettabolic, anyone reducing their calorie intake to under 900, drinking water and walking briskly for 30-45 minutes a day is going to lose weight fast. It's the same ol' stuff smoothies, fruit, veggies, two tiny meals, water and a walk.

You don't need this book to do what he is suggesting. Just cut out all carbs and sugar, drink a lot of water, take a 30 minute walk and eat every 3 hours.",12 people found this helpful,0
375,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,2,There are some good recipes in this book,Format: Hardcover,"There are some good recipes in this book, and the premise is possible, but overall, this book is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read, diet or otherwise. There are so many errors that should have been caught in editing, but weren't, from menu inconsistencies to errors in recipes and just awkward text. I can see why the recipes were written for four servings (for ease in the many small amounts of ingredients), but this puts the burden on the reader to divide recipes to a reasonable 2 or 1 person serving. For all that Rocco talks about healthy ingredients and goes out of his way to use the supposedly safe Monk fruit sweetener (and I do applaud these efforts, the ingredients withing the sugar free pudding (other sweeteners) that is used for all the smoothie recipes and all the sodium and preservatives that are in the gravy mix required for some dinner recipes do not fit with his claims. The shopping lists area particularly confusing, with repeated ingredients, sometimes specific amounts given, other times none, and enormous lengthy lists of expensive and sometimes difficult to find ingredients. This book could have been made much more reader friendly and easier to use, but not effort was put to those ends. A very disappoint book overall, I wouldn't suggest wasting your money on it.

378,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,3,interesting but difficult diet,Format: Kindle Edition,"I was excited to try this after seeing the author on a talk show. His thinking made sense and the recipes looked great. I bought the book right away and plowed through it enthusiastically, but was soon overwhelmed by the sheer number and cost of unusual ingredients required. Amazon carries many but I also had to go to a health food store and a gourmet grocer to find it all. It is a lot to buy the first week, but a most of the items last for weeks.

On the positive side, many of the recipes are really good; I lost several pounds a week for the first month; I've formed some better habits and learned about some better foods to eat. On the other hand, some recipes are pretty gross, and I quickly had to adapt the plan in order to stay on it, so I've been losing at a slower rate -- but I am still losing. A pound a day is considered rapid weight loss, and on the tv show the author said this diet is really meant for obese people who need to lose weight fast, as rapid loss puts one at risk for gall stones. I also suffer from a digestive disorder, and some of the ingredients used, like psyllium husk powder, are bad for sufferers; the book doesn't address the diet's effects on various chronic conditions, so be aware.

381,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,3,A bit confusing,Format: Kindle Edition,"First, please read carefully! The recipes are all for 4 servings, but not once in a week are you eating the same thing more than once (except the smoothies, etc). So, in other words, you have to either divide the recipe by 4, do it with 3 other people, freeze your other 3 servings, or substitute out for other meals during the week (this option is not even mentioned ... I'm assuming it will work). It is a bit cumbersome and expensive for the single dieter.

2nd; expensive to start out on this diet to get all the nutrition powders (protein, fiber, egg white powder, etc.). .

3rd; you are only getting less than 900 calories 5 days a week; 1,200 2 days a week. This is a bit limiting but I'm assuming they think the nutrition powders will ""fill you up"". Not sure about that. I've always read going under 1,200 is not good, so am eating a bit more on those 5 days because I'm hungry and feeling a bit run down.

It would have been easier to write them for one and if you were cooking for more it is easier to multiply some of the measurements than to try to divide odd amounts. Also, you are buying so much fresh food that cooking for one you do not use much of any ingredient which causes the ingredients to ruin. You would have to eat the same recipe for several days to use up the fresh ingredients before they spoil. I am 60 yrs. old which may contribute to the lower weight loss.

403,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,1,Epic Fail,Format: Hardcover,"I have waited a bit before leaving a review. I love Rocco. I just do. The guy is very likable and I wanted so much for this book to be everything it claims to be. It is an epic fail. Seriously, epic fail. I purchased it based on the fact that both Whoopi and Sherri on The View lost weight according to his diet and this book. So, after much thought, I purchased the book and headed off to the store. I didn't last a full week. Here are some of my complaints:
1. The list of ingredients for week 1 alone are vast. Same for future weeks 2, 3, and 4. Be prepared to open your wallet WIDE. There are many random and odd ingredients not typically found in your cupboards and even harder to find in your grocery store. I got everything I could (which was not the entire list) and spent more money on week 1 groceries than I care to admit.
2. There are a lot of items made with artificial sweeteners which does not align with my desire to eat a nutritious diet without it.
3. There are items on the grocery list for week 1 that are not included in any of the recipes. Someone didn't go back and double check.
4. The recipes are for 4 servings, but there are items on the recipe list that you can't hold over to the next day because of their ingredients. For example, the breakfast shake includes a recipe for 4 servings, but if you hold half for the next day it is like sludge. Too thick. So you have to cut the recipe to suit how many in your family are going to be drinking the shake.
5. Lastly, the grocery list for each is very helpful - but entirely inaccurate. It states that the shopping lists are designed for 2 people. But the recipes are mostly for 4 servings. Someone messed up on the math. It is very confusing.

I still love Rocco, but he needs a serious data checker on his next book. He also needs to use ingredients that are not foreign to the common household. (For example, Monk Fruit in the Raw, shirataki rice, xanthan gum, egg-white powder, etc.)",4 people found this helpful,0

406,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,2,Sorry I purchased this book.,Format: Hardcover,"I only wish I had been able to see the ""shopping lists"" pages before buying this book. I hate that amounts to buy are for two people. My husband is underweight, so I diet alone. In the more rare (in my opinion) cases of couples dieting together, it is much easier to double given amounts than it is to try to figure out halving amounts while shopping. The lists are poorly organized and will have you going back and forth, taking more time than necessary. One example is Granny Smith apples followed by 19 other items and then apples again.

The first recipe I looked at was the one that is breakfast every morning, ""High Protein Chocolate Breakfast Smoothie"". The recipe makes FOUR servings. This is NOT a recipe you can make on Monday and drink every day for four days. Have you ever left psyllium powder to sit in liquid? It turns into a most unappetizing gelatinous mess. Unless you are willing to eat it with a spoon, you have to figure out how to break this recipe down to one serving.

Another issue I have with this book is the cost of the food. I have encountered this problem before with celebrity diet books, in that since money is not an issue with them, they think that is the case with everyone. Also some of the ingredients are difficult to find unless you live in a large city. I live in a more rural area so finding ""tofu shirataki macaroni"" is kind of ludicrous unless I want to order online.

The last thing I'll mention is the curious mix of recommending natural,organic products and then products containing artificial sweetener, such as sugar-free Jello. Most of the people I know who eat organic wouldn't touch aspartame on a bet. I don't eat exclusively organic, but as I NEVER buy instant anything, these lists kind of turn me off.

The bottom line is, if you are into convenience foods, can find and afford the more exotic items recommended and are fine with doing the math to reduce the recipes, then this might be the book for you. If you aren't, then it isn't. I'm sending mine back, pronto.",5 people found this helpful,0

He brings up great ideas for substitutes and he has helped tone down many of my favorite high calorie recipes. However after reading this book and following the plan for a week I've opened my eyes to the numbers game he can play. The first week alone for groceries was around $500 (considering I already had some spices and protein powder.) A chunk full of money goes to processed foods I am not too happy to be putting into my body like instant pudding, artificial sweeteners, and powdered egg whites. Some ingredients I couldn't find like psyllium husk powder and shirataki noodles. Most of the recipes I feel I could put to use, I'm allergic to shellfish so some I must modify. After one week I've only lost two pounds. I never feel hungry. Sometimes it can be too much food, but I worry about not eating enough calories to lose the weight. They are delicious, However there are quite a few teriyaki and chocolate meals. The recipes are meant for four servings for some reason so I half it for us which can be tedious to have to do on the spot. If I lose the weight I want I will go back to eating all natural foods, just be mindful of my portions. I just hope it's soon because at this rate I'll be broke before I reach my goal. If I reach my goal, I'll come back and write a more laudable review.",,0

Since we avoid gmo's and eat all organic, almost entirely freshly prepared foods with very little processed foods in our diet, I expected a chef's book to work for us. Wow! Rocco goes on a rant on page 279 about our broken food system and how local sustainable food is key to a healthy diet. Since when are coffee mate 'diet' creamer, egg beaters, processed diet pudding and CAFO meats local, sustainable or healthy? He rants about our meat and dairy products being 'shot up and bathed in hormones, then recommends Butterball and Bob Evans. . . . what?

Even if you don't care about the sustainable and healthy food issues, the book layout is ridiculous. I bought the kindle version, thinking it would work intuitively, like '4 Hour Body', but, no. You have to read the entire plan day by day, with no links, then comes the grocery lists for the entire 30 days, then the recipes, not linked back to the plan, like you would expect in an ebook. It is laid out impossibly. Even the resources in the back are not live links.

All the recipes are for 4 servings. I can't see making 4 servings of something then not being able to store it until he decides you can have it again. I don't think the smoothie you make on day one would hold up until day four. Not to mention I've never heard of nor could find several items on his grocery list. Where is a substitution list for the foods I don't like or can't find? I can see that the reason he has these recipes for 4 servings is because if it were for 1 serving the portions of the ingredients are very small.

But all was not lost. I decided to go to the ""How to Maintain"" section and glean the principles of the diet. After doing that I created my own menus within the calorie restrictions given and have actually lost 6 pounds in the first five days.

But really...I honestly find myself just doing what I did before...counting calories...pizza isn't on the menu list but I had a slice the other day and I accounted for it...it is just the calories I'm allowed are A LOT less than what I ate to lose the first 70 pounds.",,0

594,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,3,"Great recipes, terrible organization",Format: Hardcover,"Good news: I've been following this menu plan for a few days. I've lost a few pounds and love the recipes. Delicious, very easy to prepare and never felt hungry.

Bad news: the book is so badly organized, I feel I may quit out of frustration. First of all, the list of recipes and their page numbers is located in the front of the book. Totally fine. However, when you are looking at the menu plan for the day you are on, there are no page numbers so you have to flip to the front of the book again to find the page number and then turn to the recipe page in the back. Secondly, the shopping lists are for 2 people. It's a great thing if your significant other or roommate is following the plan with you, but if you are shopping for yourself, you will be doing a lot of figuring at the grocery store. And lastly, my biggest issue is that the recipes are for FOUR servings! So again if only you are following the plan, you are dividing by 4 every step of the way. Why wouldn't the shopping list match the servings? And why wasn't another column added for a single? I feel if any of the editors had followed the book for even a day before publishing, they would have fixed these irritating annoyances. Now I am off to divide all my recipes by 4 so I don't have to figure while cooking.

622,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,1,Save Your Money.,Format: Kindle Edition,"I bought this after seeing Rocco talk about it on The View- all the food he presented looked tasty, and I was curious about the science behind it. Of course, the Amazon previews did not get to the parts that I really wanted to know about, so I bought the kindle version, excited to dig in and learn more.

Boo. I love Rocco, but this is like a whole new low for him. The science and the method behind the diet sounds okay. It concerns me that it revolves around extreme calorie restriction- 850 calories a day is not enough for any normal human being! Calorie restriction can cause organ failure and other major health problems. He does say to check in with your doctor, but really...

But the worst part are the recipes. Blech. They rely HEAVILY on processed substitutes. Monk Fruit In The Raw is featured heavily, and the breakfast ""shakes"" are nasty sounding conglomerations of protein powders, fiber additives and sugar free pudding mixes. Fake eggs and fat free dairy products are common... it's just a recipe for disaster and full of unhealthy options. Fake sugars, fake fats, and all kinds of chemicals (xanthan gum, anyone?) This is not a chef-inspired diet in the least, and I wish I could have my money back. I wonder how much Monk Fruit In The Raw paid him to feature it in almost all of the recipes in this book...",76 people found this helpful,0
623,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,1,Boo,Format: Kindle Edition,"Such a disappointment. I bought the book the first day it came out on Kindle and read it that morning. I saw the titles of the recipes at the beginning and got really excited. I forced myself to actually READ the book instead of skipping to the meals and then going back to figure out how to work the plan (I'm guilty of doing this a lot so I can hurry to the ""good stuff""). I was impressed with Rocco's thoughts on how we need to change our thoughts on meal preparation and do things more Mediterranean style. I was totally into this book and getting excited to get to the actual food section until I got there. Ugh. What a let down.

A lot of the meals include really random ingredients that I would need to google before knowing what I am looking for. The recipes that were ""normal"" included things like egg beaters, fat free cheese (gag), and light whole wheat bread. I would rather buy the book in print and eat the pages with hot sauce than fake eggs, fat free cheese and dry bread. Ok maybe not, but I would rather not see recipes of typical foods being turned into low fat versions by using tasteless products. I could have figured that out myself. I bought Rocco's book expecting the meals to be professional chef inspired, not something I could have figured out on my own by trying low fat versions of typical foods. The chapters leading up had me thinking I would see amazing Mediterranean recipes, not fatty American foods revamped with low fat options.

There are some recipes that sound good and I will probably try them, but I will definitely be making my own shopping list because the one in this book gives me a headache just thinking about it.

Also, on a more random note, did anyone read this: ""...and of losing so much flab I can actually fit into the ridiculously small sizes my spouse or significant other fantasizes about?"" on page 19 and have to read it a second time to make sure you actually read it correctly? Total ""WTHeck"" moment for sure. Thanks Rocco. Maybe I should have taken the $11 I spent on your book and bought myself a chocolate cake to drown my sorrows in since my significant other must be fantasizing about someone smaller -_-

I live in a very small town with only one grocery store. A lot of these items you can only find at a whole foods market. I mainly purchased this book because I saw his segment on The View and he had mentioned you could also follow this diet by purchasing ready made items (such as Lean Cuisine's, etc) for people on the go that do not have the time to cook every meal.

657,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,2,Not recommended,Format: Hardcover,"Here. I'll save you $20 on the book. To summarize, eat 5 small meals a day, 175 calories each and work out for 90 minutes a day. Avoid processed foods. Alleged result: You will lose 1 pound a day. That explains all the text.

The rest is recipes. The problem with the recipes are 1.) no pictures. Since that is the focus of the book, there really ought to be pictures. 2.) it says only eat 1 serving which is always 1 cup or less. However, all the recipes are for 4 servings, and yet in the diet, foods rarely if ever repeat. If I was eating the same thing 4 days in a row, then making 4 servings would at least make some sense. Here, I guess you are expected to throw out the extra. 3.) the ingredient list is absurd. For the first week, which equates to 35 'meals/snacks', the ingredient shopping list is 4 pages - probably 120 items. Rocco should have considered practicality - each small meal really does not need 5 - 10 ingredients. There should have been more repetition, maybe slight variations on the meals day to day, to avoid the high number of items the diet calls for.

Essentially, I doubt there is anyway anyone could follow this diet. However, it is good as a guideline. For example, use the meal/snack ideas to riff off of, knowing you need to keep your daily total to 850 calories or less. For example, breakfast can be half a grapefruit. You don't need to add cinnamon, ginger and monkfruit in the raw to it. Instead of making a 10 ingredient smoothie, just buy some Odwalla, or other variant, etc.

I don't want to say it is a bad book. It frankly feels like a first draft, and a good editor could have fixed it and added pictures, etc. But as it stands, I would probably just get one of his 'eat this' cookbooks instead. Please note I have never purchased one of those so I don't know if they have pictures. But if they did, I think you can get the same gist.",61 people found this helpful,0

But I was so disappointed when I finally got the book and read it. First of all, the quick weight loss period at the beginning of the diet has you drinking a shake every morning! Yuck! And my other problem with it is all the weird ingredients in the recipes. Rocco says, of course you can have pasta on this diet! But it's tofu pasta! Yuck! Other weird ingredients include xanthan gum and monk fruit extract. I will try some of the recipes for low cal lunches and dinners, so it may be worth the money for those, but this is definitely not a diet I can follow straight from the book because a lot of it involves foods I don't like. Bummer! Another negative is that all of the recipes are for 4 people, so unless you are cooking for your family as well as yourself, you are either going to have lots of leftovers that you have to store then eat up, or be tempted to eat more than one serving.

It's nice to have the meals planned and also have a grocery list, however I sure don't have a 1/4 of the ingredients listed.

I would be willing to bet that the people who rave about it are those who, like Sherri Shepherd , had all of their meals and snacks provided by Rocco. This is not a user-friendly diet at all! As others have mentioned, the recipes are for 4 servings and the grocery lists are for 2. Since I would be doing the diet by myself, I would have to figure out how to turn all of the recipes into single servings or end up wasting a lot of food! I started to make a grocery list for Week 1 and gave up after it reached 6 pages! I can't even begin to imagine how much it would cost to actually buy all of the items on that list, but I'm estimating it would easily be $250-$300 and take visits to multiple stores to gather all of the obscure ingredients. I've read many diet books over the years, but this one has to be the most ridiculous. Save your money!",47 people found this helpful,0

I just don't think he's in touch with the normal dieter here. Some of the suggested products, I haven't even heard of so I'm sure I won't find them in my small little grocery store. Maybe in bigger cities like NYC, it is easy to have access to a Trader Joe's or other health food stores, but that isn't so for everyone else. I think I'm going back to my Weight Watcher's plan.

He has done triathlons and I got involved with the sport not too long ago so I thought his diet book would make sense for the regular person as well for the recreational athlete.
His premise is flavorful food based on the Mediterranean diet but the evidence is quite the contrary. His recipes are full of processed and bland food such as sugar-free Jello pudding mix, bread, protein powder and fat-free Kraft slices (which can't even be called cheese), not to mention the 850 cal a day plan seems a bit excessive and restrictive. Low calorie, low fat and grains have been the culprit for the obesity epidemic in the US and this book is just more of that.
I'm half Sicilian and I can't picture my slender cousins in Palermo having fake cheese, fat free yogurt or Jello pudding anytime soon. Definitely this is NOT based on the Mediterranean Diet.

The morning smoothies are so yummy and filling, but I had significant gas and cramping from the psyllium.

Beyond disappointed, I thought this was the perfect solution for me. I did actually make the chocolate protein drink, but honestly I couldn't stand the taste. So $60 down the drain, plus I bought the kindle version and couldn't navigate my way thru the book, so I also purchased a used copy. Also, the recipe I followed said 24 packets of monk fruit.

709,The Pound a Day Diet: Lose Up to 5 Pounds in 5 Days by Eating the Foods You Love,1,Simply unhealthy,Format: Hardcover,"Rocco may be a great chef but he should stick to cooking and stay away from nutrition and fitness. Losing a pound a day sound too good to be true? That's because it is. Losing one pound of fat per day requires a 3500 daily caloric deficit. So if you eat 850 calories per day that means you have to burn 4350 calories per day. This level of intake vs burn rate will have several negative side effects. Besides feeling awful, your body will think it's starving and will burn muscle at a rate at least as fast as it burns fat. This will have the effect of slowing your metabolism which negatively impacts your fat loss. If you ever increase your caloric intake, your body will continue to think it's starving and add store the extra calories as fat which many times leaves people who pursue these rapid weight loss diets worse off than before they started their diet.

A better approach is this. Assuming you get clearance from your doctor, do a full body circuit training program three times per week. There are millions of routines on the web and you don't even need to join a gym or get fancy equipment for it. These workouts usually take less than 30 minutes. Two times a week, go for a long walk or do some low intensity exercise for 45-60 minutes. Eat six small meals a day and have a protein smoothie or two a day. Stay away from the simple carbs and limit the booze. Once a week, treat yourself to whatever you want. Shoot to lose one pound of fat per week, but instead of measuring your progress just on weight, buy a tape measure and measure your waist.",3 people found this helpful,0

- It's only been out a few days, and there are already tons of 5 star reviews from people claiming to have ""gotten past their plateau"" and ""lost 60 pounds"". Cough, cough, fake reviews.
- You can NOT lose 1 pound per day, Rocco. Please remember something folks, weight loss isn't always healthy. The title and entire premise of this book is a fallacy, but even if someone did lose 1 pound per day (which would stop very quickly), they would lose a considerable amount of muscle, strength, and would have other health issues.
- The recipes in this book are made for 4 servings. It's safe to say there is a decent percentage of readers of a weight loss book that are single. Making 4 servings is only going to entice them to eat more.
