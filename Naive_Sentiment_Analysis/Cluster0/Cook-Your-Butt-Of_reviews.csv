1,Cook Your Butt Off!: Lose Up to a Pound a Day with Fat-Burning Foods and Gluten-Free Recipes,2,Not a good fit for meatless eaters.,Format: Hardcover,"I wanted this to work - I was eager to try it. Unfortunately though, the 14 day plan would be nearly impossible to adapt for a vegetarian or vegan. As much lip service as is given to the benefits of reducing meat consumption, there are precious few meatless options included. I'm not saying there are none -- but it's a small percentage. If that hadn't been a huge obstacle for me, another thing I find slightly off-putting were the number of oddball ingredients that can only be found online (which is saying something coming from me, as someone who already has odd stuff like psyllium husk powder and juniper berries in her pantry.) Lastly, although I grasp Rocco's point about the physical activity benefit of cooking, I am not a person with the time capacity to prepare every meal fresh. I make ahead as much as humanly possible because time is crazy tight. This book isn't really built for that. He recognizes that time gets tight, and suggests store-bought replacements, but I'm pretty sure I can select a Lean Cuisine all by myself. I love the idea of this book and I hope it works for others, but it's just not going to work for me, sadly.
Added note: Occurred to me belatedly to add this ... the one thing I truly adored about this book was its Fitbit barcodes -- I wish all cookbooks and recipe sites would do that. I spend an insane amount of time entering recipes into Sparkpeople (which is linked to my Fitbit) so that I can track my meals. The barcode thing would be a game changer, and I hope other cookbook authors/publishers catch on.",5 people found this helpful,1
2,Cook Your Butt Off!: Lose Up to a Pound a Day with Fat-Burning Foods and Gluten-Free Recipes,3,"Terrible recipe pictures - they are ""red-scale""",Format: Hardcover,Thoroughly disappointed with the recipe pictures in this book. Why you ask??? Because they are all pink/red...like grayscale but red. You can't even tell what food you are looking at. I have never seen any cookbook/recipe book with completely useless pictures like this. I can't understand why the author would do something like this. Even black/white pictures would have been better than the awful red/pink color. Can anyone guess what this is a picture of??? It's actually a apple breakfast muffin...,29 people found this helpful,1
3,Cook Your Butt Off!: Lose Up to a Pound a Day with Fat-Burning Foods and Gluten-Free Recipes,3,"Clever Name For A Cookbook, But Not Worth Buying.",Format: Hardcover,"After reading about Rocco DiSpirito's book in last week's New York Times, I decided to treat myself to his book and thanks to Amazon's Prime, received the book in time to make one of his featured recipes: chicken with glazed eggplant and cauliflower rice. The fact is this recipe was featured in the Times review, but I thought that since that sounded great, it would make sense to have the book to draw on for inspiration and hopefully lose a few pounds in the process! I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the photos in the book are terrible and hard to understand the choice of red washed out pictures of the food , since it doesn't help to make it appetizing. While my wife and I worked at making the chicken with the eggplant, I couldn't quite understand how I might have lost weight while chopping the cloves of garlic! The dinner was unique and tasty so I think there will be some recipes worth making but I wouldn't rush out and buy the book for any of my friends!",3 people found this helpful,1

I bought the book to try and get some new ideas for healthy eating. I didn't get any. The pictures are better than the recipes!! Yes they are all red, white and blurry and if it is food - please let me know.
I will give him credit for the chili-rubbed chicken on page 154. I followed the recipe exactly and found out shirataki rice is like jellified alien eggs. Nothing you want in your mouth!! The chicken itself - without the other components is excellent!! I've made it several times. Use real rice and you have a winner here.

76,Cook Your Butt Off!: Lose Up to a Pound a Day with Fat-Burning Foods and Gluten-Free Recipes,5,Finally a book that does what it says on the tin,Format: Hardcover,"I simply loved this book. Nowadays it's all the trend to eat 'natural, whole foods' without counting the calories - but at the end of the day, it's simple maths - No matter how healthy coconut oil or raw almonds are, if you eat more calories than you burn, you're not going to loose weight... and that's exactly what was happened to me - I'd been eating lots of whole grains and fruit and nuts and 'healthy fats' like avocado and cashew butter but the weight simply wasn't coming off... This book finally got things back in order, the good old fashioned way - Seeing the calorie count for each recipe finally allowed me to get proper control over what I am really ingesting (and truly, isn't the point of preparing home cooked meals knowing what you're putting in your body?!!). The recipes are easy and delicious, and the chart that tells you what foods have the most pesticides from them was super useful as I now know what foods to buy organic and what foods I can buy regular, so I don't end up with a crazy grocery bill each month. All in all, I highly recommend this book if you actually want to loose weight beyond just eating healthy, it's one of the best investments I've made - super effective and an easy read as Rocco's tone is so personal and down to earth.",7 people found this helpful,1
77,Cook Your Butt Off!: Lose Up to a Pound a Day with Fat-Burning Foods and Gluten-Free Recipes,5,GREAT guide to eating healthy,Format: Hardcover,"Over the past few years, Rocco has been part of a healthy eating initiative that has helped changed the way my wife and I think about and cook food. We have purchased several of his books in an effort to become healthier and found that we truly love the recipes. We were therefore excited to hear of his newest release, Cook Your Butt Off.

Once again, Rocco has successfully managed to combine healthy and delicious. However, this book has an added bonus. Rocco incorporated the Fitbit and outlines how many calories are burned while preparing his recipes. I have to admit, I was a little skeptical when seeing some of the numbers, but tried a few recipes and it is very accurate! A few of his dishes, such as the Banana Yogurt, actually contain fewer calories than what you burn making it.

Overall, Cook Your Butt Off is a great guide to eating healthy. It is not one of those cookbooks with beautiful pictures which many of us keep on the coffee table. Instead, it is more educational and packed with healthy and (from what I have tried) delicious recipes.",51 people found this helpful,1

I see what people are saying with respect to being surprised by the pics in the book, but I don't see how that's relevant to the value of the recipes and information.
