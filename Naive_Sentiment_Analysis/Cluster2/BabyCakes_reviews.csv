Yes, it's a beautifully made cookbook with mouthwatering photos, plus it's pleasant to read. The recipes are for both good comfort foods and ones with a twist. They all sound fabulously yummy.

However, I got a bad feeling when she insisted repeatedly that you had to follow her directions exactly and to expect some failures. Any experienced baker knows that such things as humidity and altitude affect baking, and we don't all live in NYC. I've been baking gourmet desserts for over 20 years. Following her directions exactly, my results were less than perfect, and I've had to make modifications (mostly concerning yields/pan sizes and cooking times). Apparently she didn't have anyone do home-kitchen tests. However, once you have a recipe figured out, the results are delicious.

I have recommended this book to others...but with caveats. I wouldn't recommend it to an inexperienced baker. And don't whip it out to make a recipe for the first time for the bake sale tomorrow!",9 people found this helpful,1

That said, I'll be forever grateful to this book for teaching me how to make lovely cakes. I've even found the confidence, as a new GF dieter, to experiment a little with her recipes. It has been invaluable to me to see how to use the inexpensive Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Flour to make cakes/muffins without having to buy still more ingredients. (I'm lucky, I don't find the beany taste strong or offensive, and bean flour is the healthiest flour we can eat --and if you use lots of vanilla, you might not mind it either.)",,1
27,"BabyCakes: Vegan, (Mostly) Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free Recipes from New York's Most Talked-About Bakery: A Baking Book",5,This cookbook is more about the idea than the real recipes.,Format: Hardcover,"I've been to Babycakes in NYC in the last month....and these aren't the same recipes. So I would like to make a couple of suggestions.

If you are going to use a baking mix, use Whole Foods All-Purpose Baking mix, and then cut it with at least 1/3 Kinnikinnick millet flour. The reasons for doing that are threefold:

1.) Truly gluten-free. Bob's Red Mill is not.

2.) No bean flours. (Nasty, and that's not what's in Babycakes' fabulous, non-beany cookies, or at least not in the amounts Bob's Red Mill uses.)

3.) Millet is really good for baking--and I'm sure that's what they use, because I was eating one of their frozen cookie sandwiches on the way to Coney Island; at about the Brighton Beach stop, I was suddenly chewing on a millet seed.

Also, this is probably the recipe for the mint icing used as the Babycakes gluten-free cookie sandwich filling--it tastes like vaguely like coconut.

Coconut butter (Mine got melty on the subway in 90 degree weather.)
Mint essential oil (Extract is nasty. Thanks to Posh and Becks' recipe for gf Girl Scout Thin Mints for that information.)
Agave Nectar (No sugar rush from anything other than the Coney Island Cyclone)
Cocoa Butter (There is a vaguely chocolatey taste in there.)
Green food dye (They are green.)

This book is fantastic! All of my friends rave about the chocolate chip cookies and double chocolate chip cookies!! And also the Apple Cinnamon Toasties, Banana Bread! These are just to name a few! The double chocolate chip cookies i make, no one can even tell they are gluten-free or vegan, that's how good they are!! And these have been tried and tested on people who consume dairy and egg products!

But I must admit, the first few times i made them, they didn't come out very good, because I did not pay careful enough attention to the ingredients, but now, practice makes perfect, and the real proof is when your friends just gulp them down and praise you like there's no tomorrow!!

40,"BabyCakes: Vegan, (Mostly) Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free Recipes from New York's Most Talked-About Bakery: A Baking Book",4,babycakes is WICKED AWESOME!,Format: Hardcover,"I have noticed many negative comments about the inclusion of spelt-first of all she explains why it is in there, and secondly, some people who can not have gluten/wheat flour can have it. As for the frosting recipe issues- she tells you that substituting other milks for soy milk is fine, which is great, as I am allergic to soy. so I automatically substituted coconut milk and used hemp protein powder-yes you do have to let it set (irksome, as there is no immediate gratifaction and my main reason for only 4 stars)- and it was WICKED! Served it with both the chocolate and vanilla cupcakes at a baby shower and nobody knew they were gluten free and vegan. and as for those complaining about substituting flours for the spelt,I say to you bob's red mills gluten free baking flour mix. If you don't have the time/money to do trial and error that is the best mix I have found on the market, especially at high altitude (over 5k feet). also, coconut oil is the most versitle fat for vegan baking there is- yes it is more expensive than shortening, but it makes for a moist, tender crumb and has the same luxurious mouthfeel that butter has. I agree with all the other reviewers who talk about the pictures inspiring you to bake-everything looks amazing!

1/21/10 UPDATE: just made the peach blackberry cobbler, subbing gf flour for the spelt (becuase i can't do spelt) and it was delicious! also, last week made the apple pie for dinner party (again, subbed spelt flour with gf) and it got raves! so to all who are complaining about duds, i say maybe you should read the recipe through and not think you know what to do. i <3 this cookbook even more now!",One person found this helpful,1

54,"BabyCakes: Vegan, (Mostly) Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free Recipes from New York's Most Talked-About Bakery: A Baking Book",5,These recipes are great!,Format: Hardcover,"I first used Erin's recipes after watching a video of her on the Food Network website. I tried the recipes for Double Chocolate Chip Cookies and Blueberry Muffins. I have been using them ever since. I was so happy when I learned that she was publishing a cookbook!

My husband has Celiac Disease. My oldest son has the gene for CD and he has anaphylactic reactions to eggs. My youngest son's CD test was inconclusive. So, we are an egg-free, gluten-free family. It is just easier to cook things that we ALL can eat. The problem is that many GF recipes call for MORE eggs than the wheat-version. I've tried egg replacer, flax meal, applesauce etc. Some recipes can be converted, some are just a lost cause.

Erin's recipes work. I don't have to do anything special. They just work. I had my misgivings. I do not care for garfava flour. It is ok in bread, but in dessert? I read through the cookbook with trepidation. Should I use my own GF mix or trust the recipe?I will share my baking experience below.

First, I want to make a couple of comments on the cookbook. It is quite lovely. It is like a coffee table book. The pictures are nice. The writing is upbeat and fun. I like that almost all of the recipes have a picture. This book will lie flat on the counter. Although, I am nervous that I will spill something on it. Maybe it is a little too pretty. She does a pretty good job of describing the tools and flours. I would recommend a couple of things here though. 1. Explain the difference between potato starch and potato flour, or at least mention that there is a difference. 2. Tell us what kind of coconut oil to use. Extra-virgin? Refined? Is there a difference? I bet most of us are new to using coconut oil and could use some guidance here.

Another reviewer felt that it was implied that these recipes are healthy, when they are not. I would say that the claim is that these recipes are healthier, but not necessarily healthy. We are talking about desserts! Garfava flour has more protein, fiber and maybe iron, than wheat flours and rice flours. Coconut oil and agave nectar may be healthier than butter and sugar. I don't know and I don't care. I am making yummy desserts that work. I expect my dessert to be loaded with fat and sugar, no matter what form the fat and sugar take.

I agree with the reviewer that said the title is misleading. I thought that all of the recipes in this book would be gluten-free. I guess ""vegan, (mostly) gluten-free, (mostly) sugar-free"" makes for an unwieldy subtitle. There are a lot of GF recipes though. Everything I am interested in, except the biscuits, is GF. I am sure I will get around to trying to modify the biscuits so that they are GF as well. The cupcakes (except red velvet), cakes (except one), frostings, most of the muffins, cornbread, banana bread, gingerbread, brownies, blondies and drinks are all gluten-free. The pie crust, scones, biscuits, a couple of muffins and a couple of cakes/cupcakes are not. Even so, I have no regrets about buying this cookbook.

Here are the recipes I have made so far.

Blueberry Muffins:
The recipe in the book uses spelt flour, so I did not try that one. I have been using Erin's GF Blueberry Muffin recipe that I found on Food Network.com a few months ago. It is great! I use about the half the cinnamon she calls for, but otherwise I make them according to the recipe.

Double Chocolate Chip Cookies:
Again, I am using the recipe that was posted on Food Network.com. I think it is the same as the one in the book. When I started using this recipe, I was not willing to buy the coconut oil, so I have been using butter. (We are not vegan, my son has an egg allergy.) This works really well with butter, if you don't have a problem with that. Now that I have the coconut oil, I will probably try these using that. I do use a little less flax meal than the recipe calls for.

Brownies:
I made these using garfava flour. The batter tastes gross. You can taste the garbanzo. However, the brownies themselves are excellent. They are moist and very chocolatey. She recommends making them in mini-muffin pans. I don't have those, so I used my 8x8 baking pan. It took about 30 minutes longer to cook them in that pan. The brownies are very rich. They taste great warm or cold. I do think I can detect a slight hint of garfava flavor in the brownies, but that could be my imagination. Even so, they are very, very good.

Lemon-Poppy Teacake:
I did not follow the recipe for this. I was nervous about using Bob's all-purpose flour since it contains garbanzo and fava beans. (I hadn't tasted the brownies yet!) So, I used a GF mix I make based on a recipe at glutenfreegoddess.com. The teacake turned out pretty well, but the lemon flavor was very strong. This is probably because my flour does not have the strong flavor of Bob's. Also, there are a lot of poppy seeds in this teacake! I will definitely use less next time. Overall, it is a good teacake.

Cupcakes:
I made the vanilla and the chocolate. I halved the recipes so that I wouldn't end up with a ton of them. These are probably the best eggless GF cupcakes I have ever had. I do think I can taste the garfava flour in the chocolate ones, but it is not overwhelming. They are still great cupcakes. They have a good structure without being too moist or too dry. We haven't even frosted them yet. We are eating them plain and loving them.

Vanilla Frosting/Sauce:
I couldn't find powdered soy milk, so I used powdered cow's milk. The frosting is pretty good, but you can really taste the coconut. I am using extra-virgin coconut oil, so maybe a more refined oil would have less flavor. I don't know. This frosting is liquid at room temperature, so I don't see myself giving up the buttercream altogether. I do like the flavor though! I haven't used it to frost the cupcakes yet. I have it in the fridge, waiting for it to solidify. I can see myself using this for certain things, but not everything.

I really like the cookbook so far. None of the recipes have been duds. Once you have all the ingredients, the recipes are pretty simple to follow. I am glad that I bought it!",27 people found this helpful,1

I did not wait for the cupcakes to cool, but rather took one out, blew on it to cool and popped it in my mouth. These cupcakes are amazing! I also admit I licked the spoon that I used to get the frosting out of the blender - Oh My Goodness!
I am so happy to have found this cookbook!

I recently had to change the way I have been eating for health issues. I am on a diet that restricts eggs, dairy, sugar, yeast, and gluten. Needless to say, it's been hard to get used to and even harder to find products that accommodate all of these restrictions!

I had a friend who told me about the cookbook. I figured it was too good to be true and would be too difficult, yada, yada, yada. I waited. Then for my last birthday, another friend bought me a dozen cupcakes from the actual bakery in NYC. I was in love after the first bite. The love and the time and the effort that this woman has put into these creations absolutely comes through in the flavor, the consistency, the final product. I quickly bought the cookbook.

1. The initial purchase of all of the items you need can be a little costly (compared with regular baking ingredients). I look at this like an investment in my health and happiness. I can now eat a special treat along side everyone else at birthdays and dessert times. No more making excuses as to why I can't indulge. And the most expensive ingredients tend to go pretty far, so you get many products from one purchase.

2. I read this book cover to cover and no where did I see the writer make any claims about these treats being good for absolutely anyone to eat. It seemed to me that she was simply trying to make products that are free of the usual suspects and that taste good. It also seems to me that she has succeeded! She has a very successful business in NYC and another new one in L.A. If these recipes fell flat, she would have closed her doors long ago. Further, she explains that not all of the ingredients are gluten free or sugar free, so if you find something you can't have in the ingredients, either a.) don't make that recipe or b.) use the substitutions that she has detailed in the book. When it comes down to it, you are responsible for making sure that the food that goes into your mouth doesn't have anything in it that you are allergic to. Look at the ingredients, make sure that they all are ok for you and then make that recipe. Or make the necessary substitutions, as explained in the book.

3. I have made these products quite a bit lately. I have family and friends begging me to make them cupcakes and cookies. These are people who are used to full fat, full sugar baking ingredients. They have stated how much they like my baking and how great they taste. These products are not just for allergy prone people. Truly they will be enjoyed by even your most finicky guests!

4. The fact that I use agave nectar to sweeten my cupcakes means my son doesn't run around like a maniac after I give him a treat! It's so nice not to want to keep him from having a sweet because I don't want to deal with a 2 year olds' sugar high and sugar let down. I have not had these problems giving my son these treats. I also feel better about giving my son a treat without all the chemical and preservatives in it. He seems pretty happy with them too!

5. There were a few occasions that I had questions about an ingredient or a result and I wrote to the bakery. They were so accommodating and helpful! I was able to get the answers I needed and my sweets have been so much better. I don't know of many other authors of cookbooks who will answer your questions. I was quite surprised to get the response, but even happier at the willingness to help me succeed in my baking. Thanks Babycakes!

6. You may not get it exactly right the first time (I screwed up the frosting several times before I got it - I had the wrong ingredients! My mistake), different ovens work differently and so you may need to adjust time, you need to measure everything with dry measuring cups, not liquid, coconut oil should be melted before measuring, better quality products yield better quality products (I highly agree with using the french valrhona cocoa mmmmnnnn), etc. But if you stick with it, you'll find it's not scary, it's actually quite easy and the results are worth it!

I noticed that there were some unfavorable reviews and I truly couldn't understand them. This book is wonderful! The sweets are delicious! All of the time, effort and love that the author put into creating this truly comes through in the final product. The author takes the time to explain substitutions, where you can get the products, what she thinks works best, etc. I have been able to follow these directions and make some great stuff! I am very appreciative, as are all of my friends and family who are benefitting from my new love of baking! Thanks again!

I would highly recommend buying and using this cookbook. Whether you are allergy sensitive, vegan, health conscious or just want to try something different. I have never really been a good baker, but thanks to these recipes - no one would ever know that!

I've made the chocolate chip cookies twice now. They make about 3 dozen so I freeze them and take them out a few at a time. They are totally amazing. Much better than the Gluten Free Betty Crocker mix I had tried before.

It is true that not all the recipes are gluten free and I was a little bummed at first. But then I realized I would not have made any of them anyway. I do feel wording on the cover is misleading.

The ingredients are very expensive but that was to be expected because everything gluten free is expensive. I was glad that I could find all the ingredients at my local Harris Teeter grocery store. We don't have a Whole Foods or any of those types of stores nearby.

Coconut oil was the most expensive ingredient I had to buy but you can substitute canola oil so I'll be doing that from now on(I missed reading that part before I bought it). You really do have to read the whole book to find different tips. Also, evaporated cane juice is sugar!! So don't pay major $$ for sugar with a fancy name.

I saw that some people complained about the use of Bob's Red Mill Flour. I really didn't notice that it tastes different from regular flour. My cookies tasted great and that is all I really wanted.

So far I am happy with this book and look forward to make the ""fat pants"" soon.

*After reading a lot of the reviews (lots of negative ones)I feel like I need to include a few helpful hints so people can have great results like me.
1) Use canola oil instead of coconut oil if you are concerned about price.
2) If you do use coconut oil melt it in the microwave first then measure it. (This is no where in the book, but it is what you are supposed to do.) I melted it at 50% power for 30 seconds at a time until it was liquid.
3) Use dry measuring cups for all ingredients (even liquid ingredients!!)I'm pretty sure this is what everyone does wrong and it would definitely alter the taste and not in a good way.
4)Read the entire book before you even buy ingredients. Seriously. Otherwise you will miss a small, but important, detail that is not in the actual recipe. (I think this was a flaw in the book as well. I feel that if you need to know it then it should be on the recipe page.)
5)Follow the recipe closely. I read it several times before I started and it really helped.
6)All ovens are different. Mine cooks really fast. Yours may cook slow. So don't freak out if the cook time isn't exact. Stick a toothpick in it occasionally, when it comes out clean it is done.",4 people found this helpful,1
85,"BabyCakes: Vegan, (Mostly) Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free Recipes from New York's Most Talked-About Bakery: A Baking Book",4,I love Babycakes,Format: Hardcover,"I am not an experienced baker, not do I have a gluten allergy. Simply put, I just love this bakery and wanted to try to recreate at home. Due to the abundance of negative reviews, I first checked out this book from my local library. I made a few desserts (the cookie sandwiches, vanilla frosting, and cupcakes). I did not have success with the frosting, but the cookies and cupcakes were fairly straight forward and simple to make. That said, I emailed the bakery about the frosting and they promptly replied with some recommendations. Then, I had success (I added more soy milk powder and oil, then pulsed in the food processor until creamy and the consistency I wanted). Then, my husband bought me the cookbook! I am thrilled to own it and bake from it quite frequently.

My thoughts on the cookbook layout, ingredients, and recipes:

Cookbook layout: This book is gorgeous and the layout is so fresh and fun. It's a really beautiful book, as others have noted. Make sure you read the entire book before you begin. Erin makes a lot of helpful notes throughout, as well as provides ingredient explanations and tips. Also, see the actual website for more cookbook help.

Ingredients: Yes, the items you need are much more expensive than cheap, bleached white flour and Crisco. I eat both gluten-free and flour-based desserts and sweets, and I always buy the best ingredients available. I strongly believe in eating only the very best food, so why put something in your body that is processed, cheap, and full of additives? That said, these ingredients are not really any more pricey than non-gluten-free ingredients. The coconut oil should be virgin and can be found in small jars at Whole Foods (in fact, I found EVERYTHING I need at Whole Foods in one shopping trip). It's about $10 a jar and some recipes use the entire jar (the frosting and cookies or cupcakes) but for the most part the jar will make 3 or 4 desserts. I buy a few at a time and store it, and usually Whole Foods has their 365 brand on sale for $6.99 a jar. You must also melt the oil before use; I microwave mine in the jar and it's fine. You're also supposed to use the unscented variety, but I can't seem to find that so I just use what WF has and it's fine.

Also, the flours get a lot of use out of them, even if they are a bit more pricey. Try to find the Bob's Red Mill large bag of the Baking Mix- it will save money and time because you will use that mix quite often. I don't have a problem with it's taste; I actually think the mix is delicious. My favorite is the spelt flour though and the entire section on scones and biscuits. Yum! Thumb through the book and make a list of all the flours needed, that way you can purchase all at once and store them in your freezer. Bob's Red Mill makes everything you will need, except the spelt of course. I use Arrowhead Mills Whole Grain Spelt and it's inexpensive. The Xanathan gum is the only pricey one (at $11 a bag at WF) but you only use a 1/4-1 teaspoon per recipe.

Another recommendation is the get to know the ingredients before you begin. It took me a few recipes to become acclimated with the flours and oil, but now I understand how they fit into each recipe, just as I know about the purpose of flour, sugar, butter and eggs. If you are able to understand these ingredients, you will be able to make modifications when a recipe doesn't turn out as planned.

Lastly, I use regualr sugar- the Baker's fine sugar. It works out well for me and it happens that I have a large container at home. So, I didn't spend more money on the evaporated cane juice, which is essentially the same thing (only not as processed).

Recipes: My only negative review of this book is that a lot of the recipes don't turn out perfectly on the first try. After I made my favorites (cookies, cupcakes, scones, biscuits, cornbread, and the apple loaf) I made them a second time and they turned out much better. I had to change ingredient amounts, baking times, and pan sizes. I feel like Erin did not test her recipes in a normal kitchen with normal size pans, thus the discrepancy in the baking times. The loaves work best when made in two pans (or muffin tins) and I don't really follow her baking times because mine always take longer. However, I do think she did a great job in writing her first cookbook. I'm sure her second is bound to be better.

Good luck to everyone. I really recommend the scones; they are easy to make and terribly delicious.

UPDATE: I add 1/3 cup more flour to EACH of Erin's loaf recipes. For some reason, mine all fall and stay gooey despite long stays in the oven (one cooked for over an hour to no avail). So, I checked the babycakes website for cookbook help and it's noted to add more flour. I add the extra flour no matter what- I prefer a drier crumb and plumper loaf.",4 people found this helpful,1
86,"BabyCakes: Vegan, (Mostly) Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free Recipes from New York's Most Talked-About Bakery: A Baking Book",4,"So far, so good",Format: Hardcover,"I got this book today and promptly made the chocolate cupcakes and attempted the chocolate frosting. I've been gluten-free for about a decade now so I already had many of the staples in her list in my pantry. I think coconut oil is the only item I needed to pick up, and I think that one is also going to be my nemesis in using this book. The cupcakes turned out fantastic. They taste great to me. The boyfriend, a wheat-eater, says they taste ""like brownies"". I'll do a couple things differently next time. First, I'm not going to turn the pan around 15 minutes into the cooking. All the cupcakes fell when I did that. I would have been better off leaving them alone for the full cooking time. Secondly, I'm going to tweak that chocolate frosting recipe. I followed the directions and ended up with chocolate soup. I suspect the 1.5 cups of unsweetened soy milk called for on page 93 should actually be 1.5 tablespoons. There is no way this could thicken up to a frosting-like consistency. I mean, I get that what we're going for here is a sort of modified mayonnaise, but it didn't work. Was it the humidity? A different brand of soy milk? I'm not sure, but I'm intrigued by the concept and I'll mess around with it until I get something that works.
THAT is the best thing about this cookbook for me. She's got some ideas about how to eliminate wheat, dairy, and sugar and still get something that looks like and tastes like a baked good. I'm delighted and looking forward to experimenting.
Word of warning, the entire muffin/scone section uses spelt, which doesn't work for us of the purist GF crowd. Who uses every recipe in a cookbook,though? I think it's worth the purchase for the many other recipes. I'm looking forward to her book #2.",2 people found this helpful,1
87,"BabyCakes: Vegan, (Mostly) Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free Recipes from New York's Most Talked-About Bakery: A Baking Book",4,"Great new baking perspective, but not for the beginner",Format: Hardcover,"Wonderful book, but not for the novice. If you are used to Betty Crocker, the ingredients list will read like Greek. If you rely on precise measurements, you will very likely end up with a disappointing final product. But if you consider yourself a pretty well-versed baker and are looking for a new twist on some old favorites (or by no other choice are forced to look for a new method due to dietary and/or health restrictions), this book is actually really fun and eye-opening. The chocolate coconut icing is surprisingly delicious, the double chocolate chip cookies are super tasty (add a little extra flax and be generous on the measurements of flour), and I have adapted the super tasty scone recipe to a number of different flavors of scones--all delicious. The most notable thing about all the recipes is how NOT dessert-coma'd you feel after you eat any of them--the sweetness never gets to you to the point where you can't take another bite (maybe that's not a good thing?) and none of the treats sit in your stomach all day like the butter-rich ones you get at the local bakery or coffee shop. The downsides--1) The ingredients list is overwhelming if you haven't spent a good amount of time in a health foods store or organic market. 2) She relies heavily on the Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Mix. I have always found this mix to give off a notable aftertaste (likely due to the bean flours) that is not always palatable to those who aren't used to the ""gluten free"" taste. There are much better-tasting all-purpose mixes on the market, I would prefer to try her recipes with an alternative mix (though I have not yet, so I can't offer suggestions). 3) Other than the icing, there is not a single recipe in my book that does not have notes scribbled in the margin regarding tweaked measurements. She stresses in the book to follow her measurements PRECISELY... and yet, when I did, the final product was far from perfect in consistency every time (especially the cookies). Not to say there's anything wrong with learning from your ""oops!"" baking moments, but you would expect more care to be taken given her stern instructions at the beginning of the book. All in all, I feel it is a great book that will offer the open mind some new techniques and great recipes... as long as you know you may to take a few missteps in the process.",,1

The recipes in this book come out closer to the texture of wheat products than any other recipe or pre-made gluten free baked good I have tried in the 4 years I've been gluten free. Amazingly light and velvety.

I took a star off for two reasons. I do believe the title is somewhat misleading. And, the ingredients are expensive and hard to find. But be persistent in finding them, because you won't be disappointed. The cupcakes, carrot muffins, and apple toastie recipes have all resulted in delicious goodies.

It is important to note: do not subustitute; make each recipe exactly as written. (Be careful to use garbazno-fava flour, not plain garbanzo. There is a big difference in how the recipe turns out.Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Garbanzo Fava Flour, 22-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)) Also, the author states recipes must be made using dry measure cups for flours, and liquid measure cups for liquids.

90,"BabyCakes: Vegan, (Mostly) Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free Recipes from New York's Most Talked-About Bakery: A Baking Book",4,"Great for vegan, gluten-free baking",Format: Hardcover,"First, let me start by saying that the Babycakes book is about both gluten-free and vegan baking. Anyone, who has tried to do both at the same time, will appreciate the addition of even a couple of great, reliable recipes to their repertoire, which is precisely what this book does.

Before I got this book, Erin's brownie recipe (which she had generously shared on a gfcf board) was the staple of my vegan, gluten-free baking. Not only was it the best brownie I've ever had (including those from my gluten-eating days), it was also the most reliable gluten-free vegan recipe I had tried. So I morphed it into all kinds of other muffins and cupcakes. After getting the book, I tried the vanilla cupcake right away and it was AWESOME! It had the right structure and crumb, retained its shape and was beyond delicious (although I did have to bake it longer than the recipe stated). My daughter was ecstatic and all of my gluten-eating, non-vegan friends thought it was an excellent cupcake. None of us detected an aftertaste from the garbanzo flour. I also tried the carrot cupcakes and the meyer lemon and bing cherry cupcakes and they were great, too! So, for me, this book was worth every penny just for that those few recipes. There could be better or easier options for the folks whose only restriction is gluten-free. Given our multiple allergies though, this was a godsend for us.

Now the reality check - as others have already mentioned, the book is not entirely gluten-free (which is a real pity), so be careful! The Pies & Cobblers and the Biscuits & Scones sections are entirely spelt-based. In addition, half the muffin recipes use spelt. For the pies and cobblers, you can easily substitute any gf flour mix and it wouldn't really matter. However, I am disappointed that not a single scone or biscuit recipe is gluten-free. As for the muffins, I use the three gf recipes as the base for any kind of muffin and just change the flavors (Erin has guidelines for how much of which fruits and veggies to add per cup of flour). However, since most spelt recipes in the book could be converted to gluten-free, one has to wonder why Erin didn't do the work for us already? As far as ingredients go, yes, they are expensive but that's not news to people on special diets. Assuming you are not the type of gluten-free baker that only uses ready-made mixes, you would already be familiar with most, if not all, of the ingredients used in the book. I am, however, disappointed that she recommends using agave syrup and a ready-made mix as staples. Agave is a refined/man-made sweetener very high in fructose (similar to high fructose corn syrup). Why anyone would add that to their diet is beyond me. As far as the mix is concerned, I think Bob's mixes are fine in a pinch but they are an expensive shortcut and I prefer to make my own (it's not that hard to replicate Bob's mix without the flours you don't like). I can only imagine the reason the mix is included in here is to make it simpler for the reader. Luckily, you don't have to follow that recommendation if you don't like it.

All in all, this book is a valuable addition to the library of any gluten-free, vegan baker. While there is clearly room for improvement in the next edition, this is an excellent start and people with multiple allergies/sensitivities will appreciate the menu-expanding options this book offers.",,1
91,"BabyCakes: Vegan, (Mostly) Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free Recipes from New York's Most Talked-About Bakery: A Baking Book",4,Decent Results,Format: Hardcover,"I recently bought this cookbook, and realised this book is divided into two categories for recipes, and almost equally divided. Those that are gluten free entirely, and those that are simply using an ancient form of wheat: spelt, which is not gluten free. The difficult part of this is that anyone displaying an allergy or sensitivity to wheat that tested no on gluten allergies may have latent problems that build up with no symptoms and can occur years later by eating an ancient version that is weaker in gluten.

I love the truly gluten free recipes, and wish the spelt ones had a substitution guide since there are no real suggested alternatives. There are no comments as to if the recipe will modify, and no discussion as to if it has been attempted. So it tends to tease one on what they cannot have as well as providing what they can in great forms.
I have eaten some of the products at the bakery, and loved them. I wish this book was laid out a little differently with substitution options, and did not make the assumptions as to sensitivity levels.

Overall, with what I have cooked out of it and with the review of the contents, I feel it is a good purchase, but one I will limitedly use repeatedly for a few of the basics.",,1

I'm confused after reading some other reviews though...
Everyone seems to be so upset that the book says it's ""gluten-free"", yet spelt flour is used in some recipes. The cover of my book says, ""Vegan, (Mostly) Gluten-Free, ...."". It clearly says to me that the recipes are ""mostly"" gluten-free, and I wouldn't expect them all to be. Someone also mentioned the coconut oil, and not knowing how to use it...in the book Erin says you have to melt it before you measure it. Also written, is that you need to measure all the ingredients using ""dry"" measuring cups (even the wet ingredients are measured this way). If so many people mis-read the title, maybe they missed that information too, and that is why their baking didn't turn out so well?

Everything I've made so far has been great! I've tried the apple-cinnamon muffins, banana bread, apple-cinnamon toastie, brownies, chocolate chip cookies, and vanilla cupcakes. The brownies and chocolate chip cookies were TO DIE FOR! So good! My apple-cinnamon toastie came out a little undone, and I had to cook it a lot longer...I know I totally overfilled the pan, and next time I won't, cause it was tasty!

I think that Erin did a great job with this book, and did explain in detail how to make the recipes come out. You just can't miss reading anything! The ingredients are expensive, but that's not her fault. If eating vegan, and gluten-free is important to you..I would definitely buy this book. ( Even with the non-gluten-free recipes cause you could always change the flour, and the other recipes are totally worth it). If you're just thinking about eating that way for health reasons, I would definitely buy this book cause cause everything has been so yummy.

I have only made a few recipes from the book so far, but they have all come out perfectly. I have seen several complaints about not knowing to melt the coconut oil when measuring it for a recipe. If these readers had read the section on Ingredients in the beginning, it does say you need to melt it before measuring. When using unfamiliar ingredients, it is always a good idea to read the section the author has written about them. Also, yes coconut oil is expensive, but on the Babycakes website FAQ it does say you can use any other oil for the recipes, except for the frosting recipes. Substituting something cheaper like canola oil works just as well. You can also use evaporated cane juice instead of agave nectar as long as you add some water, the specifics of which are also discussed in the introduction section.

I wanted to have healthier sweets without having to eat chemicals and sacrifice flavor. I'm so glad Erin developed these incredible recipes and wrote this cookbook.

I'm an excellent cook and baker, but all non-vegan. Vegan baking is a whole nuther ball game. I tried 3 recipes so far and all have been wonderful, even when I messed up. The first thing I baked was the vanilla cupcakes and accompanying vanilla frosting. I used the Bob's Gluten Free All Purpose Flour instead of the Garbanzo Bean/Fava Bean Flour that the recipe clearly called for. The mix was so dry I added water and I pretty much doomed the cupcakes. They fell and I sliced what I produced into thin slices and re-baked the slices into a cookie type thing. The flavor was really good. The frosting was terrific. I was enjoying it with the ""cookies"" made out of the botched cupcakes, and my grown kids came over and finished the vanilla frosting in one sitting. Everyone who tasted it raved about the flavors.

Next I made the double chocolate chocolate chip cookies. I followed the recipe and have the most delicious cookies. They don't taste the least bit funny, even though they are gluten free. They are perfectly salted, perfectly full of chocolate, richly decadent, and the texture is perfect cookie. All friends and family are so impressed. No one can tell they are vegan at all. They are fantastic.

Babycakes' cookbook uses soymilk and soymilk powder for the frosting, while on Martha Stewart's show and at her bakeries, the recipe is soy free and uses rice milk and rice milk powder. If it can be easily found, use the rice milk and rice milk powder like Erin showed on the Martha Stewart show. It works either way. I think she may have used the soy in the book as it's easier to find than the Rice Milk Powder.

Be forewarned, the ingredients are much more expensive than flour and sugar, but the high quality ingredients make this stuff taste so good. Nothing tastes funny or beany. The gluten free flours she uses do have beans in them, but beans are very starchy and bland anyhow. In savory recipes, beans are seasoned alot to get them to have flavor. Neither I nor anyone in my family tastes beans in these desserts and I follow the recipes exactly. The ingredients are excellent and tasty.

About the vanilla frosting, I had no problem with it setting up. Erin makes it very clear in the book that the Vanilla Sauce/Frosting is a sauce until it chilled for 6 hours. I made it and stuck it in the refrigerator overnight. It was set after that. It needs to be chilled. I believe the problems with it setting up for other reviewers are from not letting the frosting chill overnight with the refrigerator door closed. Opening and closing the door during the day is not going to let that frosting set.

One problem in the book is that there is no mention of using melted coconut oil in her recipes, and the recipes need MELTED COCONUT OIL. Why that's not mentioned on each recipe or in the book, I have no idea. Also, I didn't have a melon baller, and I've never owned a melon baller. She says to use the melon baller to measure the cookie dough for the Double Chocolate Chocolate Chip cookies. I made the Chocolate Chocolate cookies by rolling the dough in to little balls and then she says to smash the cookie dough down. I smashed it quite a bit, and the cookies didn't flatten like they did in the picture in the book. I smashed more on the rest of the cookies. Her recipes make big batches. All the batches of cookies were delicious.

I recommend this book to any good cook who wants to eat better sweets that are just as delicious as the butter, eggs, cream, and sugar stuff many of us love. The bonus is that it's so much better for you. I love it and I'm so grateful to Erin for sharing her recipes and for developing them in the first place. I am loving Vegan Baking and I'm brand new at it. I can make wonderful wonderful things and don't feel guilty at all eating them or sharing them with my friends and family. In fact, I feel wonderful feeding these desserts to people.

I had a friend who worked on a bake sale at our town's University and she brought me home a vegan cookie. Yuck. I'm actually a little resentful that no one goes to the trouble that I and Erin do to get it right. I never get as good as I give (because my food is fantastic). I set the bar very high. I'm a huge fan of Maida Heatter. This stuff meets that bar.",One person found this helpful,1

1) If you don't have any issues with corn, I use cornstarch in place of the arrowroot and potato starch (same volume) with good results. (I do this simply because I normally have cornstarch on hand but no arrowroot or potato starch and I wanted to cut down on the number of special ingredients I was purchasing.)

2) I didn't have the best of luck with her frosting. Heidi Swanson in Super Natural Cooking has a recipe for dairyless, gluten-free chocolate mousse which makes a nice frosting. Alternatively, sometimes I use trans-fat-free margarine in place of the butter in any traditional buttercream frosting recipe. (Soy/rice milk or even coffee in place of the milk, obviously.)",4 people found this helpful,1
98,"BabyCakes: Vegan, (Mostly) Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free Recipes from New York's Most Talked-About Bakery: A Baking Book",4,Mostly Awesome...but frosting needs some work.,Format: Hardcover,"I've read lots of bad reviews about this cookbook, but I have to say that overall I absolutely love it! I won't go into all the merits of the graphics and how fun it is to read, etc, but I'll focus more on the recipes. I've made several things out of the book and all except the frosting have turned out great. Here are the things I've had easy success with: chocolate chip cookies, double choc. chip cookies, blueberry muffins (think I used blackberries), red velvet cupcakes, vanilla cupcakes, spelt biscuits, and blondies. I had no problems with any of these and will make them all again and already have made some again. One tip I've found...I always set any baked good to cook at less time than the recipe says...I just like my baked goods more chewy than others I guess. Anyway, you can always add more time on if it isn't cooked, but it helps you not to overcook b/c some ovens run different. I've also made the johnny cakes...those came out tasting good, but were too dry...I'd add more water next time to those.

Why I give this book 4 instead of 5 stars...
1) the frosting. I have made the frosting twice. The first time was an overwhelming disaster and I followed instructions to a T. They are pretty simple, after all. The second time, I used the measurements on the Martha Stewart website and the frosting came out much better, but I still don't think it came out right. It came out good enough that I'll try again and make some tweaks of my own, but with so many recipes in this book using the frosting/sauce, this recipe is too integral to not work right.
2) I'm pretty disappointed that this isn't the actual recipe that they use in the bakery...in fact, I was disappointed that it looks like several, if not most, of the recipes aren't exactly the same as in the bakery. I feel that is a misleading, especially in light of the way that Erin describes the frosting in the cookbook - it sounds like the recipe in the book is the ""real"" one, but it's not. (You can check out the list of ingredients on her blog - they are very different.) I am especially disappointed and frustrated with the soy milk powder that the frosting calls for. On the list of ingredients used in the bakery, neither soy milk powder nor rice milk powder (nor any kind of milk powder for that matter) are on the list. This elusive product has had dozens of people in fits looking for it and it is expensive for something that is not even used in the original recipe.
3) The challenge it was to find all the products. While this may be part of gluten-free cooking, with all the resources she puts in the cookbook, there were a few obvious things that consumed a lot of my time trying to figure out that could have been included. In the list of ingredients at the beginning, it would have been nice to know that evaporated cane ""juice"" are crystals, not a liquid. I went to every store in town looking for this in all the wrong places. I finally found it in the bulk bins at Whole Foods and sometimes it is called other names. Just look on the back of the ingredients and the only ingredient listed should say ""evaporated cane juice"". The other ""biggie"" to me is not telling us to heat the coconut oil. Having never cooked with it before, this wasn't obvious to me, especially as those of us who use crisco on the rare occasion do not heat that up for baked goods. I do really appreciate the resource sections that Erin includes, just wish there were a little more there to help with some of these recipes.

Overall, I do love this cookbook, but I would only recommend it with hesitation. You kind of have to go into buying it if you know you're committed to using it and cooking with these alternative products. If the rest of the recipes weren't coming out so well, I would have given if 2 or 3 stars for the disappointment of the above mentioned factors.",2 people found this helpful,1

First of all, I'm a sucker for a good cover and pretty pictures, which this book has in abundance!! But I've found it to be helpful, because the artfully directed photoshoots actually inspire me to bake the items, even though we all know they'll never come out looking THAT good. But the taste--the obviously more important aspect--is top notch!! I've made a handful of recipes so far, including the Pumpkin spice muffins, the mini agave-sweetened brownie gems (OMG), and the biscuits....they're all amazing!!!

The only critique I have with the book (and the reason I give it four stars) is the rarity and priciness of the ingredients. For a college student's budget, it's not feasible to make these things regularly. But if you make the trek to whole foods, suck it up and buy a bunch of the essential ingredients, you'll be good to go. I just looked through the recipes and bought the ingredients most frequently mentioned that I didn't have (spelt flour, garbanzo-fava bean flour, arrowroot, potato starch, etc). HOWEVER, I have been substituting canola oil for coconut oil (less pricey and way less fattening) for every recipe so far, and they all taste perfectly great. Also, I've used corn starch for the same effect. I've found that the recipes are actually quite substitutable if you don't have every single ingredient on hand (or just have certain preferences).

They're definitely recipes to impress, and you will not regret buying this book! True to the Babycakes theme, every non-vegan I feed my treats to cannot believe they're really vegan. A large step up from substituting smart balance and egg replacer for every non-vegan dessert recipe for sure. DELICIOUS!",,1

Personally, I wanted a vegan book to help me w/ my pre-diabetes. I got exactly what I paid for, and for those who are having difficulties, I would LOVE to try to help substitutes some comparable flours to help you eat these delicious treats!

For any diabetics out there, pay attention to the delicious use of coconut oil and agave nectar. I have made these for kids I babysit for as well, with WONDERFUL results.

A few tips:
*If you need to buy in bulk, buy from Bob's Red Mill on amazon.com! FREE SHIPPING!

*Read the ENTIRE cookbook, as there are a lot of specifics that are not too hard to follow (using dry measure cups, etc.)

I find that these recipes are too sweet for me, but they work just as well if you reduce the sweetener. I cannot afford coconut oil, agave nector or evaporated cane juice (all of these are called for) but these recipes work just as well with canola oil and granulated sugar. Some of the reviews complain about the use of bob's red mill all purpose flour mix, but I find that it works well in the recipes that it is called for.

So far, I've baked the banana bread (which was amazing-- no one knew it was gluten-free), the apple-cinnamon toastie, the vanilla cupcakes, and the cornbread. While the cooking times were a bit off (I have a thermometer inside my oven, and usually end up baking the breads at a higher temp and for a longer time), the end results were very tasty.

However, the one major disappointment of the cookbook for me was the frosting. I've made both the chocolate and the vanilla several times, and neither recipe yielded an edible result. Both taste ok, but mostly they just taste like coconut oil-- and the texture is totally off. I heated all the ingredients (so that the coconut oil didn't bead up) and used a hand-mixer (since the food processor didn't seem to work)before refrigerating. The ingredients listed on the Babycakes website for their vanilla frosting in no way resemble those in the cookbook's recipe. Many of the other recipes require a good frosting, and so I was very disappointing not to get the ""real"" Babycakes frosting recipe with the cookbook.

All in all, there are some disappointments with the cookbook, but I will definitely make many of the recipes again. It's worth buying if you want truly delicious vegan and gluten-free baked goods.

Oh, and one note about the ""health"" factor-- coconut oil and agave nectar are infinitely healthier than butter and sugar.

As for the reviews complaining about the costs of things, please realize that you can substitute for cheaper ingredients such as canola oil and honey...another tip would be to buy just the needed amount of oil, sweetener and soy milk powder from the bulk dept at a health food store.

The main reason though that I love this cookbook is BECAUSE of the use of coconut oil and agave. Unrefined virgin coconut oil is wonderful for you [...] and is antiviral, antimicrobial and antifungal, potentially helping calm down a host of health problems. Agave nectar has a low glycemic index and is way better for you than refined sugar as well.

That she developed these recipes based around these facts is great, but the fact that she did this and made them taste outstanding is even better.

I highly recommend this book. A must if you or your child has dietery challenges that eliminate gluten, dairy, and or eggs.

Neither of us have any gluten allergies so all the recipes are open to us. The first thing I made were the chocolate cupcakes. The first batch didnt come out quite right as they ended up crumbling to bits as soon as I took a bite. I substituted the garbanzo/fava flour for brown rice flour(like the book says, you can substitute flours for all you people who dont like the garbanzo/fava flour) I added a little more applesauce and the second batch came out awesome, I think I ate over half the batch by myself. I made the double chocolate crumb cake next and it came out perfect, no complaints there. I have had no luck at all with the icing but thats okay because most of the stuff I have made hasn't even needed it(I did however learn that you can not substitute any other oil for the coconut oil in the icing.) I just made the spelt biscuits, pumpkin muffins, and the red velvet cupcakes and they came out just right. Some of the recipes take a second or even third batch to make them perfect but its totally worth it.

They were both so greasy from the coconut oil...I had to put the cookie dough in the fridge for a bit to harden the coconut oil because it was oozing all over and basically just coating the dough instead of getting incorporated into it. The teacake had white globs of something that wouldn't dissolve in the batter...maybe it was the xanthan gum, or one of the flours, but whatever it was, I ended up just throwing out the entire loaf. The textures are another issue...I know Erin said she likes her cookies crispy, but you could break a tooth on those chocolate chip cookies. I thought perhaps I over-baked the first batch, so I deliberately under-baked the second batch, and still hard as a rock. The actual flavor was OK, but I just couldn't get past the excessive oil to rock hard texture. The lemon teacake was a spongy disaster...I cooked it exactly as long as she recommended, rotating 180 degrees after 18 minutes and then cooking for another 17 minutes, but it was still uncooked in the center, so I put it in 10 minutes longer...still not done, so I put it in another 10 minutes. Finally it was done, but it was the strangest texture ever...more spongy than teacake crumb-like.

I am so disappointed because I really wanted to love this book. I gave it two stars because of the beautiful photography, but the two recipes that I've tried only deserve one star. I will try one more recipe, probably the cupcakes, just to give it one last shot, but I don't have high expectations at this point. Gluten isn't an issue for me, so going forward, I will probably just use a traditional recipe using regular flour, and then will swap out the non-vegan ingredients for vegan substitutes...things like Earth Balance sticks instead of butter, VeganEgg instead of eggs, etc, and I bet I'll get a much better end result!",8 people found this helpful,0

171,"BabyCakes: Vegan, (Mostly) Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free Recipes from New York's Most Talked-About Bakery: A Baking Book",1,i don't have time to read more than what is in the actual book!,Format: Hardcover,"the GOOD:

* the book looks nice. i like the girls and their uniforms. pretty. i have been to the store in NY, and, well, it's a really small store next to chinatown. the book makes the store look much bigger and nicer, but i guess it makes the book look nicer so i marked that as good

* i like the celebrity quotes. although, yes, this is a form of marketing and the fact that i like that thin natalie portman and pamela anderson love the place makes me one big sucker (yes, i feel ashamed that i fall for this marketing stuff!)

* i like the page where erin tells you how to naturally color frosting. neato! have not tried this yet though because...

the BAD:

* like everyone else who has tried to make their fabulous frosting (sooo good in the store), mine flopped big time! i'm not a full-time vegan (guilty! i know!) because i do not have really big food allergies, so i do bake regular food as well and i was VERY excited to see that erin's frosting does not require me to heat egg whites, or use my kitchen aid standing mixer (hated washing the thing twice, once for cupcakes, once for frosting usage). unfortunately, after buying tons of ingredients, my frosting was not thick the next morning. i had to junk the whole thing. it also was not sweet enough.

the UGLY:

* i don't like extra work. i do not like extra clean-up. i do not like extra reading from other sources when it should all be in the same book. after my frosting disaster, i had to go to Babycakes website and read their entire FAQ section on the cookbook on how to fix the dang frosting. then i had to go to martha stewart's website to find the right recipe. then i also read the blog on Babycakes site to see what this one woman did to fix it (added coconut milk, changed the measurement of ingredients). THEN i had to skim read the beginning of the babycakes book to find out that erin does not even use soy milk at all even though her recipe states soy milk (she uses rice milk). sorry, i do not read cookbooks cover to cover, i read recipes and read what i want when i have time. THEN i find out in the FAQ Babycakes section that she uses a special proprietary blend of rice milk powder and it's not on the freakin market!!! it's like a milk powder monopoly only available for the elite with a patent on it that won't allow us common folk to purchase it. what the heck?!

* so bottom line is when i went to Babycakes NYC, i remember the cupcake tasting OK because well, it is a healthier vegan cupcake but the frosting was amazing. when i made the cupcakes, i ended up with a tasty healthy cupcake better than the ones in the store, but a really screwed up frosting. btw, i used, for the first time, king arthur black cocoa powder to give the color a darker hue and king arthur dutch processed cocoa to give it that great chocolate taste. my first time being a pretentious cocoa baker but i had to try and i think it did make a difference. but, the black cocoa does not specify how much to put in. i used 1/4 c black cocoa and 3/4 c dutch processed in the healthy hostess recipe and it turned out fine.

(NEW!!! Updated Sept 2010)
TIPS:

1. Frosting: Have not tried this yet, but I found this information on Martha Stewart and on Erin's Babycakes site although it seems to have been deleted now)
Use 3/4 cup rice milk INSTEAD of soy milk
If you can find it, use rice milk powder INSTEAD of soy milk powder (which I cannot find)
maybe use 1 cup of coconut oil instead of 1.5 cups. If you turn to the chocolate frosting recipe, it's 1 cup over there so I'm not sure which one is right. I still need to try it myself). Either way, if you do the exact recipe as printed you will end up with a liquid slop that will not thicken enough to sit on a cupcake.

2. Just made the apple-cinnamon toastie:
Do NOT POUR the entire batter in the loaf pan. She made a vimeo video stating not to do this. This recipe can be either for TWO loaf pans or use the leftovers to make muffins or whatever. The batter rises A LOT so don't fill it more than half-way before adding the darker sugar added batter that makes the dark swirl.
Notice it calls for 1 cup of roasted apples. When you roast 2 lbs of apples, you get like 4 cups! I made the mistake of not reading and added all 4 cups to my loaf batter. Makes it more watery. So, yea, also notice on the actual apple cinnamon muffin recipe, that she still only says to add 1 cup of apples. So WHY BOTHER making 4 cups? I HAVE NO IDEA!!! Also when you make the sugar dark brown swirl mixture, don't fold the apples in before doing it like she says to. I have no idea why she said to fold them in beforehand, but it just screws up the mixture and the apples kind of get in the way. Anyways, my family still loved it and ate it. I loved it and ate 6 slices in one day. But, I want to make a better loaf next time so that is my advice.

Let's just say, I'm determined to make her stuff even though the book is an illogical mess. I keep a sharpie next to the book and write all over it so I remember what to actually do next time to make it right.

Also, evaporated cane juice is a screwed up marketing word for fine cane sugar or Florida Crystals. Don't get lost asking everyone that works at the grocery store for evaporated cane juice because you will think you can't get it when it's actually there and NOT CALLED evaporated cane juice. Found info on this when I looked online. GOOD LUCK!

FROSTING UPDATE 4/2011:

After three tries (including the Martha Stewart version which wasn't perfect)... I have perfected the vanilla frosting. Enjoy! Changes are denoted with a (*). Obviously, she has denied the recipe being wrong...but it is. If you look at the choco frosting recipe, you have to balance the ratio of dry ingredients to wet and have them match the vanilla frosting...duh. and they don't match. her dry match, but her liquids don't...obviously something is wrong. For perfect consistency try my version:

1 1/2 c rice milk
1 1/4 c dry soy milk powder (*)
2 Tbs coconut flour (*)
1/2 c agave nectar (*)
1 Tbs vanilla
1 1/2 c coconut oil
2 Tbs Lemon Juice

Note: still can taste soy too much, so if you have rice milk powder it's best to use that. i still can't find it on the shelves over here and hate S&H charges so i haven't tried... but again consistency with my version is great. ergo, my ratio of dry to wet is awesome.",88 people found this helpful,0

But I bought this book because of the substitutions for sugar and the hope that in using less white flour and sugar and butter, that I would be able to create tasty treats that are more healthy than what you find at the store.
I was very disappointed. I baked the blueberry muffins, the red velvet cupcakes and the pumpkin muffins, and only the pumpkin muffins were edible (in my opinion). I swaped out the bob's all purpose for the spelt flour in the blueberry muffins and they were better right from the oven, but the next day they LOOKED moist (probably because of all the oil in them because the book does not include the all-too-necessary fact of MELTING the coconut oil before measuring!!) but they tasted SO dry I could barely choke down two bites.
And the vanilla frosting was a disaster!! I didn't understand how 6 hours in the fridge could turn ""vanilla sauce"" into ""vanilla frosting"" and I was right. 2 days later...it's still sauce. And it doesn't taste anywhere near as good as they describe on the website. I certainly wouldn't be eating this stuff straight. It's okay, but not great. Now I'm trying to figure out what to do with this big bowl of expensive vanilla sauce!
If you need to try these recipes, buy the book used and read ALL the FAQs on the website before starting. It might save you a little money.
Tip on the pumpkin muffins....bake them in a ""muffin tops"" pan so they spread out a bit....in the regular cups, they never cook all the way through. Tasty, but mushy.",33 people found this helpful,0

185,"BabyCakes: Vegan, (Mostly) Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free Recipes from New York's Most Talked-About Bakery: A Baking Book",1,"So promising, so disappointing",Format: Hardcover,"I was diagnosed gluten intolerant in 2003, and--as there were very few gluten free (GF) products available in supermarkets at that time--began my foray gluten-free baking immediately. I was very excited when I learned about this cookbook given Babycakes reputation as a top-notch gluten-free bakery.

All of the specialty flours, xanthan gum, and other ingredients required for gluten-free baking make it a tricky and expensive endeavor. As a graduate student, I don't have the time or money to ""experiment"" with gluten-free recipes--hence my excitement when I discovered this cookbook. I assumed that the author(s) of the cookbook would have done my experimenting for me (which is presumably what I am paying them for when I buy the cookbook); hence, if I follow the instructions, the products should turn out as expected. Sadly, this is not the case.

I have tried about half a dozen recipes from this cookbook, and only one of them has come out properly (the double chocolate chip cookies)--and even that was with my own substantial modification of the flour/liquid ratio in the recipe. The banana bread was a mushy disaster, the lemon poppy cake was okay but didn't hold its shape, and the apple bread required nearly 3x the required baking time to set properly (but then tasted like it had been baked far beyond the ideal baking time).

Like I said in the first paragraph, I have six years of experience in gluten free baking. It's a bit tricky, sure, but when tried-and-true recipes are followed, homemade GF products (particularly quick breads, which are far simpler than yeast breads) turn out deliciously. I get the feeling that these recipes were not truly tried and tested by the author(s), and it shows.

187,"BabyCakes: Vegan, (Mostly) Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free Recipes from New York's Most Talked-About Bakery: A Baking Book",2,If only the recipes lived up to the design...,Format: Hardcover,"As has already been pointed out, this is a beautiful book, and it gets readers excited to cook despite the hefty price tag on every ingredient required. If the recipes themselves lived up to the writing and the design of the book, it would be completely worth all the celebrity praise that has been heaped upon it (although, looking at it now, I realize the praise is for treats made AT Babycakes, by Babycakes, not really for the cookbook). I've heard so many rave reviews of the bakery that I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this book. I immediately went out and spent $80 on ingredients (I had none of them on hand, which I would imagine is true for most bakers) and tackled the recipe I was most excited about: gingerbread with vanilla frosting. It was a disaster, but it didn't stop me from trying another recipe. And another.

Here are my three biggest issues with the cookbook:

The first and most major disappointment for me in working my way through this cookbook is that it seems pretty clear it was never properly tested by regular people in regular kitchens. Perhaps in the commercial ovens of the Babycakes bakery, in commercial pans, the cooking times and temperatures listed in the book are right on. But the sad fact is that in a regular kitchen with a regular oven, they are completely off (most of that $80 ended up in giant globs on the bottom of my oven, smoking up the joint). That first recipe I made was not just ""moist"" in the center, it was completely raw and inedible. As for other reviewers, the frosting was a huge (and again, expensive) disappointment for me: not only was it nothing like real frosting, it had that distinct, gluten-free texture I've come to refer to as ""Metamucil-mouth.""

Which leads me to the next big issue I have with the cookbook...and really with all ""alternative"" cookbooks of late. Please JUST STOP saying ""no one will be able to tell the difference"" and referring to your recipes as ""great substitutes"" for the traditional versions. A) It isn't true that they taste identical to. At best, they are reminiscent of. And B) if it really is a great dish, or treat, then just say it's great. Don't compare it to its non-alternative counterpoint, because you're going to turn off the very people who would benefit most from changing their diet to include more wholesome, nutritious foods.

Third issue: Coconut oil. I made the frosting three times, each time in a food processor. The third time, I thought ""Hey, why don't I melt the coconut oil so it's smoother to begin with?"" Nowhere in the cookbook does it say to do this. But when I did, the results were shockingly improved. The flavor still had Metamucil mouth, but the consistency was actually something akin to ""fluffy.""

Interestingly enough, I bought the Babycakes cookbook right on the heels of another cookbook purchase: Falling Cloudberries: a World of Family Recipes by Tessa Kiros. It is in no way vegan, gluten-free, or sugar free...but neither am I, actually. I've just found that I feel and look much better when I don't have too much wheat, meat, or sugar in my diet. Like the Babycakes cookbook, Falling Cloudberries features stunning photography (though it's a completely different aesthetic), fantastic writing, and a spirit of enthusiasm that makes you want to get in the kitchen and tear it up. And I wondered, maybe the lack of really foodie-worthy gluten free cookbooks stems from the lack of real chefs--people who already know so much about food--writing them. Every bit of hype for Falling Cloudberries was more than warranted by the recipes. Babycakes, not so much.

Maybe it just wasn't the right time for a Babycakes cookbook. By all accounts, the shop is constantly hopping with happy, satisfied customers returning for more. Maybe Erin McKenna and company didn't want to give out their actual recipes for fear of being copied in other establishments. Who knows. In the end, I wound up finding some great recipes on my own that feature the ingredients I bought and customizing them to my taste..and I make them all the time. One such recipe, for savory chickpea pancakes, has resulted in weekly dinner parties because I've had so many people ask for more. It's simply a delicious recipe--not a ""substitute"" for something else. So take heart and stay curious; there really are good things out there to use that fava/garbanzo flour for. :)Falling Cloudberries: A World of Family Recipes",6 people found this helpful,0

I would agree with all the reviewers when it comes to the cost of ingredients and the added steps. There is one recipe that asks you to bake the vanilla cupcakes to make the ""crumb"" base.

What really detracts from the book, however, is that these recipes--in my experience, at least--make too much volume for the stipulated baking pan. I find this really curious. Right now I'm cleaning up a big mess in my oven from the banana nut bread recipe that overflowed and burned on the floor of the oven (and I only put 4/5 of the batter into the pan!). The other thing I'd note is that the end product is just barely sweet. My guess is most people will think it doesn't taste sweet enough.

When it arrived, I sat down and excitedly read it cover to cover with a pen and paper in hand to make my baking grocery list. It was then that I came across upon several issues:

1) As mentioned by many others, the book is only about 2/3 gluten-free. I know that Babycakes bakery bakes spelt items, so this was not a surprise to me. However, the book sub-title calling it Gluten-Free is misleading.

2) A large amount of the recipes call for Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free All Purpose Baking Flour. There are two problems with this. First and most important to me, this flour is N A S T Y. It has garbanzo and fava bean flour in it, and those have a very strong and bitter taste. Many bakers, including myself, hate this stuff. Second, I was dissapointed to see that the book even suggests using a mix at all. On the Martha Stewart show when Erin and Martha make the Allergen-Free Cinnamon Toasties, Martha asks as she is stirring the flours together, 'Do you use mixes at your bakery?' Erin answers no. If this is the case, then why on earth is the cookbook directing me to do so? If the recipes had the true list of flours and starches used at the bakery, I would have an easier time making substitutions, like swapping garfava flour for, say, a combo of sorghum or rice flour, or subbing potato starch for arrowroot or cornstarch.

3) Coconut oil and agave nectar. These fabulous, spendy, and sometimes elusive ingredients are frequently used in hefty quantities in the book, and unfortunately we are left a somewhat in the dark about the details. Yes, the resources give us brand recommendations (aside: Did you look into the coconut oil source? small jar and big $$), but does not specify if it matters if we use virgin coconut or regular coco oil or light or dark agave. Since I don't want to go broke buying coconut oil, I googled and found an extra-virgin organic coconut oil by Nutiva that comes in 54 oz. containers and is reasonably priced. The same goes for the agave nectar. Madhava has a raw organic agave nectar that you can find right here on Amazon in bulk for a decent price. Hopefully these will so the trick.

4) Frosting. I do not believe these are the frostings used at the bakery. For example, a red flag to me is that the cookbook recipe for vanilla frosting is called 'Vanilla Frosting/Vanilla Sauce"" but the Babycakes bakery frosting is called ""Creamy Vanilla Frosting"". While on Martha Stewart (the episode where they made the Allergen-Free Cinnamon Toastie loaf), Erin casually mentions some of the ingredients of her famous frosting. Among the ingredients is coconut milk. Unfortunately, there is zero coco milk in the book recipe, but there is liquid and dry soy milk. Babycakes NYC is a soy-free bakery. This is so disappointing to me, as I was really looking forward to making the real deal.

At first I thought it was just me, and the way I was making up the recipes (even though I've been baking for years). However, at a friend's birthday party, the hostess ordered cupcakes from Babycakes specially for my daughter, who refused to eat them. The chocolate cupcake was, quite frankly, inedible; and she turned the other two (vanilla and one other kind) down flat - and this is not a child to turn her back on sweet treats! So much for Babycakes.

I was also stunned to see an entire chapter of spelt recipes, in a book that boasts of being ""gluten free."" If you go to the trouble of adding the qualifier ""mostly sugar free,"" why can't you put ""mostly gluten free"" on the cover? Ever hear of truth in advertising? Apparently not. We can get gluten-full recipes anywhere, any time. What a sham!

This book has everything, or so it would seem: glossy photos worthy of a fashion magazine; celebrity endorsements and beautiful photography. What it doesn't have is honest-to-goodness recipes that can stand alone and speak for themselves.

I have to agree with the other reviewers here, this book is misleading (it is wheat free not gluten free) and the recipes are terrible and inaccurate. Bob's Red Mill GF all purpose flour is pretty gross unless you like sandy bitter cupcakes and cookies. In the book, Ms. McKenna talks about how Bob's flour is ""... so superior to other mixes that we would collapse in a tear-drenched tantrum if they ever stopped making it"", I wonder if she uses premixed flour in her bakery. Additionally, please don't use dry measuring cups for liquid ingredients as advised in this book. The reason liquid measuring cups are used for liquids is a little thing called accuracy.
However, the biggest problem with the book is Ms. McKenna's apparently enormous ego. Take the title 'New York's Most Talked About Bakery'. She is constantly saying things that let the reader know she is apparently the greatest baker of all times and this would be fine if her recipes delivered the results she promises. They do not.
New York City is a place where celebrities live, sometimes they eat baked goods. why do I care what such and such actor thinks about your cupcake? This does not make the cupcakes baked with your recipes taste better. Ms. McKenna could have easily included more useful information about gluten free baking on these celebrity pages (5 more pages to be exact).
One of the pitfalls of glamour is thinking you are more important than you actually are and letting your Art suffer as a result. Not only has the potential craftsmanship of this book suffered, it inspires failure in people with the desire to bake healthier treats. It is sloppy, inconsiderate, misleading and arrogant.

If you make any of the gf recipes, I highly recommend substituting in sorghum or another (less disgusting) high protein flour for the garbanzo-fava flour. Unless you like your chocolate cupcakes w/ an overpowering beany flavor.

I'm also thinking I may swap something else in for the agave nectar, which is crazy expensive. And while I'm not an expert, there is some controversy surrounding agave nectar... it's my understanding that there not all agave is harvested responsibly, and that some brands market ""organic & all natural"" agave nectar which is, in fact, chemical refined & converted into a product that is just about as healthy as HFCS - do your research, people!

As other reviewers have stated.... many of the ingredients in this book are very, very hard to find (even at Whole Foods & my crazy -but well stocked- little local health food store). And while I've grown accustomed to paying a premium for many of my gf products, some of the most expensive baking ingredients in this book are used frequently, and in quantity.

I'm giving this book two stars for the beautiful photos, and the usefulness of these recipes as jumping off points for health conscious & allergic bakers. But don't be afraid to tinker.",3 people found this helpful,0

Don't be fooled by the title nor by the lovely picture on the cover. Looks can be deceiving! after purchasing the book, I bought all the necessary items needed to prepare what should have been great desserts/treats. BIG mistake there! As another reviewer wrote, the items needed are not found in your average grocery store, which means one has to either order them online, or be lucky enough (like myself) to live in an area where the items are available. Once getting beyond that, I was ready to get started. I made the chocolate cupcakes (found on page 87), and let me say, they were such a HUGE disappointment, I threw them out! The recipe calls for garbanzo-fava flour (which I used, 1 cup of coconut oil, and 1 1/3 cups of agave nectar. this was a recipe for disaster! It all ended up tasting like beans! YUCK!! I am vegan, but if I were to serve any of these desserts to my non-vegan friends and family, they definitely would have a bad impression on vegan treats! I bought this book not only because it was vegan, but because it was gluten free and sugar free, and because of the shop itself. The book is not the best and I gave it 2 stars simply out of sympathy! The cookbook itself though will not discourage me from visiting the shop in NYC.

It says, ""Vegan, Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free Recipes..."" That would lead one to believe that all of the recipes are gluten-free, which is not the case. (They are all vegan, though.) About half of the muffins, ALL of the biscuits and scones, and half of the pies & cobblers contain spelt flour, along with the occasional item from the chapters in between. (Be careful to watch for recipes that include other sub-recipes, like the Red Velvet Crumb Base.) the introduction to the book makes it clear that they aren't all gluten-free, but this is not apparent from the cover.

The recipes also rely heavily on agave nectar (just about the only sweetener in the book), which is controversial, health-wise. Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Gluten-Free Baking Flour, coconut flour, and coconut oil will also be definite must-have's if you are to make much from this book. Overall, though, the author seems to have done an amazing job creating recipes free of eggs, dairy, and often wheat, while still maintaining ""normal"" textures and flavors. Soy is rarely used (amazing, for a vegan cookbook!) and, where it is, there is usually an alternative offered in the notes.

I gleaned a few things from this book, but I probably wouldn't use it on a weekly basis. If you're considering it, you might want to get it from your library before investing in your own copy.",,0

I had terrific success with the chocolate cupcakes (super good, i highly recommend), but the vanilla were just okay (kind of grainy in texture and not very vanilla-y, but I'd try it again). The main problem was the frosting. The vanilla frosting just turned out runny and never really set up, the chocolate turned out fine (although due to the coconut oil I used, it tasted a lot like coconut with some chocolate favoring, but that was my fault).

I emailed Babycakes NYC asking about a possible misprint with the vanilla frosting recipe and any other errata, but never got a reply. I did discover from their blog and other cooking blogs on the internets, that a LOT of people had problems with the vanilla frosting, plus other issues that i can't testify to, so beware. I think its a good book and let's face it, vegan/gluten-free/sugar-free recipes can't be easy to develop, but definitely read the WHOLE recipe first and then do a google search - just in case other people had problems with that particular recipe. After doing this, the vanilla frosting turned out just fine - it was reminiscent of a traditional cream cheese frosting, but one that didn't make my teeth hurt :)",One person found this helpful,0

Well, I guess agave isn't white sugar, but anything with over a cup of agave in it (which is often highly processed) is probably not considered sugar free in the conventional sense. By sugar-free, I think of dates, applesauce, and other sweet whole foods.

Yes, there are gluten free recipes. However, many of them have spelt--many of the really important ones, that is. Sure, a pie filling may be gluten free, but if the crust isn't, the book isn't much good to me. I can find a filling recipe anywhere--the crust is what is tricky. The pie chapter, for example, is 12 pages long, and only has 5 recipes, only 1 of which is gluten free, and it requires buying store made ice cream as the filling.

Some nice points: photos of everything, and a lack of shortening/margarine. The icing is a little heavy on the soy taste, but the cocoa helps mask that. I could do without the lengthy recipe introductions on each page, celebrity plugs, lots of white space, and anecdotes--I'd rather see the pages filled with more recipes.

This cookbook is good for those new to wheat- and animal-free baking, who have access to expensive, difficult-to-find ingredients, and want to make a decent dessert.",,0

I am a vegan and a trained chef. I have been making vegan desserts for a few years and was excited to try the recipes in this book. As much as I hate to say this, the cupcakes AND frosting were barely palatable. I used one of the wheat free sugar free recipes and overall it was a bomb. My kids would not eat anything past a first taste, and I struggled to like what I was eating. We are all used to vegan cakes because as I said I cook/bake that way all the time. I use agave regularly as well, but it didn't make the cut here at all. There are notes in the book that say one has to try these recipes a few times to be successful and I am wondering if that is because the tastes are so far away from classic dessert tastes they are ""acquired"" tastes.

Perhaps the cupcakes at the shop are infinitely better than the ones you make at home from the recipes provided.

Did you notice that she does a bait and switch? A page entitled Happy Hour is devoted to gushing about her ""fabled frosting shots"" sold at the bakery but then she executes a bait and switch - hey, the frosting recipe in this book is NOTHING LIKE the frosting in those ""fabled frosting shots"" at the bakery so while she encourages us to also serve up frosting shots too, our frostings shots will be terrible in comparison. Hmmmm, she obviously did not give us the bakery recipes which is WHY I BOUGHT THE BOOK for heaven's sakes! If she was not going to give us the babycake bakery recipes she should NOT have produced this book. Honestly - where is the integrity?

All in all - great photos, fun font, but the silly writing, poorly tested recipes, and lack of integrity has cemented my decision to not bother visiting her bakery. Some of the writing actually made me gag ""towering ode to the magical pairing of mint and chocolate"" Was the editor out to lunch? I felt the author was trying to pull a fast one but we are not taken in that easily - the food is just not that great no matter how many laudatory adjectives she uses.

Perhaps it's me, and I'm not overly experienced, but nothing I've tried so far has come out well.

First reaction was the general disappointment that a cookbook labeled ""Gluten Free"" was not gluten free. Then I was worried that someone would make something for my husband thinking spelt flour was ok for him to eat and he would become very ill. It is very dangerous to throw around words like ""gluten free"" when someone's health is on the line.

Second reaction? ""Holy Crap! This is going to cost me a fortune!!!"" Every single recipe calls for coconut oil, and after making just 3 recipes from the book I have used an entire $10 jar. Agave is the primary sweetener which is also extremely pricey. I have been using maple syrup instead, but I've used almost an entire $18 jug in those same 3 recipes. Add to that the flours, ricemilk and various other gourmet/specialty ingredients and you've spent a small fortune.

The recipes are pretty yummy, though, I must say. If you've got the money to spend and aren't totally offended by her misuse of ""Gluten free"" then I suggest trying a couple recipes out. Though they aren't without their problems as well... If you are used to cooking gluten free you know that it isn't ever without it's hiccups, and adding ""Vegan"" makes it all the more challenging. I would say this cookbook is not for the beginner cook at all.

Here are the recipes I made and my reviews:

Lemon Poppyseed Teacake
Very yummy, but a little dense. Not fooling any non-celiacs with this one. It was still moist even 2 days later which is hard to find with GF things.

Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies
The batter was super runny and greasy. I had to add an additional 1/2 cup of rice flour just to keep them from running all over the pan. They were very tasty, but my husband thought maybe they could be sweeter. They seemed somehow bland. I think adding chopped dried cherries or mint flavoring or something else would have helped. These also stayed moist.

Chocolate Chip Banana Bread
This one is my favorite. The recipe calls for 6 bananas (SIX!?!?) and I only used 2. I put it in the pan and I thought there is no way this is going to bake all the way through, so I split it into 2 pans, and thank goodness. I think it would have overflowed.

So the down sides:
#1. not entirely gluten free
#2. really expensive
#3. recipes may take some tweaking

And the good things:
#1. the book is beautiful
#2. pictures for almost every recipe
#3. recipes stay moist and are very tasty",17 people found this helpful,0

I made the basic vanilla cupcake recipe, which supposedly the owner of Babycakes used as the base recipe for all other flavors. I sure hope not because these cupcakes are disgusting. There is no way anyone is making a living off of these awful cupcakes. They are gummy and flavorless and started to burn before the 22 minutes they were supposed to bake. The frosting actually made me gag. It was super liquid-y and tasted like pure coconut oil combined with the horrible flavor of unsweetened soy. Let me just say that soy milk powder should never be used to make anything that is going to be consumed by a human. I tried to save it by adding coconut sugar and more vanilla extract, but it was still horrible.

I would not have bought it myself. I wanted to give it one star out of spite, but that would be unfair - if you follow the recipes, you will end up with good stuff, which is the most important metric for measuring the success of a cookbook. The plot thickens, however, and the short review is that I was disappointed. Here's the long review:

In buying this book, you will get exactly what you pay for, which is the style manual for the most chic, upscale hipster bakery New York has to offer. I've decided that this book is not so much a bakery cookbook as a lifestyle statement from hers truly, Erin McKenna. She must feel she has been the object of much fawning over, from the authoritative and at times pretentious tone she takes throughout the book.

I found myself shaking my head at her ingredient selection, which includes

-Bob's Red Mill flour: inexplicable and unforgivable! Are you serious? This is equivalent to asking for Bisquick in your baking cookbook. The biggest challenge of gluten-free baking revolves around your flour blend; relying on a premade (and might I add gross-tasting) flour blend is a high-magnitude cop-out.

-Agave nectar: a pretty passÃ© ingredient that blew through the collective health-consciousness as quickly as it appeared. This comes off as more of a lifestyle marketing stunt than any real effort to be health-conscious, and to some degree it dates this book embarrassingly.

-Coconut oil: fair enough, McKenna, but as any home baker comes to realize, this stuff is expensive and not always indicated. Olive oil or butter (if, like many, you are GF but not vegan) will often suffice.

I'm no expert, and I certainly don't own the IP to New York's most successful allergy-friendly bakery, but as a fairly experienced gluten-free baker, I've found many of these recipes to be lackluster. She doesn't seem to have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, leading to reliance on ingredients like Bob's Red Mill. And spelt!

You read that right: spelt. It's not gluten-free. It's not gluten-free! Why is it in this book? It alienates a significant percentage of this book's target audience (because, let's face it, it's not any kind of vegan bible). Spelt is the number one cop-out of the gluten-free world - it says, ""I want to cater to your needs, but it's too hard so I'm meeting you halfway, which only works for a small percentage of you.""

I've walked away from this book with only bad things to say. This book is, first and foremost, a lesson in successful marketing. It's full of artsy pictures of hipster girls looking oh-so-cute in their baking getups. There are some helpful ideas in here, and any gluten-free baker could stand to learn something from this book. But it's a poor substitute for a comprehensive bake book, and lord knows gluten-free folks are sick of poor substitutes.",,0

The truth is though, a cookbook isn't primarily about being a visual feast, though it can at least be said that this book is gorgeously laid out. The recipes are the main attraction and if they fall short than the cookbook is a flop. And boy do they fall short. First of all, I spent 76dollars on ingredients to make the famous vanilla cupcakes. Followed the recipe to the best of my abilities and they came out, well, disappointingly. The frosting was a complete failure. I was more than a little chagrined to later read on the baby cakes website that I was supposed to melt down the coconut oil. Really!? That would have been helpful information to have in your cookbook dear. You know, like, in the instructions? Not only that, but she comes right out and says, in her website, that the frosting she makes in her bakery contains an ingredient that isn't available on the market, after passing the frosting in her cookbook off as the same one that she sells in her bakery. Above all, the frequently asked questions in her website, about the cookbook, comes off as being unbelievably smug and talks down to the reader big time. Why did my cookies fall flat? Is one of the questions. Not sure is the answer. Ok, thanks, that was super helpful. The recipes in the book are paired with pictures of her baked goods from her bakery which it appears are not the same recipes used in the book. Where I come from, that's called fraud.

Ms McKenna promises much and under-delivers in equal measure. On reading the book I quickly realized that a great number of the recipes use spelt flour, which I avoid, and so are useless to me. Still more are based on ""crumbs"" - leftovers that may be readily available in a specialty bakery, but not in the average kitchen. Baking something with expensive ingredients only to turn it into crumbs for another recipe is counter-intuitive. To try the recipes requires a significant initial investment in expensive and often hard-to-find ingredients: coconut oil, agave nectar, xanthan gum, and a specific brand of gluten-free flour. Having slavishly followed Ms McKenna's recipe for banana bread to the letter only to have the finished product disintegrate on my chopping board (it was brown on the outside and entirely raw in the centre), I was irate. I could understand (although not forgive, in view of the price of the book) a few errors in scaling down recipes normally used in a professional kitchen to a size suitable for the home cook, however, of the recipes I have tried, none has accurate measurements, cooking times, or cooking temperatures. If these recipes were truly crafted in Ms McKenna's home kitchen, before she opened her bakery, the business would never have seen the light of day.

Vegan frosted treats that can stand a bake-sale on a sunny day? GOOD LUCK!!

I find the cupcakes at BabyCakes in LA to be super subpar, but their icing is delicious and stands the test of time. I got the book for the icing alone - I can make much better cakes myself.

This icing is NOT what they serve in the bakery. The warning signs flashed when I saw that it called for only 1/4 cup agave. REALLY, now? All other icing recipes call for a couple cups of sugar, yet this one only needs 1/4 cup sweetener, but cups and cups of expensive soy products and coconut oil? Just from reading, I knew it had to be off, but I tried it anyway - some recipes surprise you, but not this one!

The result? A beautiful and perfectly textured LOOKING icing that tastes like a mouthful of soy flour and oil (basically what the recipe is). NOT SWEET, definitely NOT something to share with guests or kids who want that icing corner of the cake!

I understand that I can attempt the other variation to make this with rice milk and powder, but WHY spend that much money to try again, when the original soy recipe in the book is so horrible, as well as all the other reviews here? UGH!!

I have a disgusting batch here now that I'm trying to doctor to salvage all these expensive ingredients. This must have been a $7.00 batch of icing. I could have just gone and bought a tub of Pillsbury icing. That's vegan too!

Apparently there are some people who have a really strong aversion to the bean flours used in the mix, and I am very much one of them. I mixed up my own gf flour blend without the bean flours and I was really excited to trying the banana bread recipe without the bad aftertaste. I have tried and tried several of these recipes (chocolate chip cookies, frostings, and cupcakes--mostly because some of these are gluten free, unlike several other recipes) with really bad results. Besides the bad aftertaste and oily consistency, there was the problem of the baking times being off. That is what happened with my last attempt, the banana bread. I was so happy at the look of the bread loaf when it came out of the oven (after baking it 15 minutes longer than the said 35 minutes the recipe claims) and broke off a little piece to see if there was that awful bitter taste, and there wasn't! After it cooled, however, the center was completely raw. After looking on the website and seeing that the author says to fill the bread tins half-way, I am seriously frustrated at the fact that she did not think to include that tip IN THE RECIPE. It would have saved my bread and the costly ingredients I just wasted. Again. I gave the author, this cookbook, and these recipes the benefit of the doubt for several months, even after reading the negative reviews, but now my patience is worn out.

First of all this is food porn at it's prettiest. No doubt about it, the pictures alone inspire cravings and the hope that your confections will turn out as heavenly as they are hyped up to be...but none of my cookies or cupcakes look anything like the pictures in the book.

The vanilla cupcakes were very ""vanilla"" if you will. There was nothing special about them...in fact they were bland and dry all the times that I made them...however they are useful seeing as how they can be transformed into the ""crumb base"" that you can easily turn into macaroons...so if you have the time to bake an entire batch of cupcakes just to get some macaroons then go for it! (The macaroons are actually VERY tasty and moist). The vanilla frosting was also bland and not as thick as you'd like a frosting to be (my friend politely and creatively described the taste as something like ""flavored water""). I've never tried making the chocolate cupcakes for whatever reason, but I have made the chocolate frosting. It had more flavor than the vanilla frosting, but again not thick enough for my liking.

I made the pumpkin muffins once with high hopes...but the muffins turned our VERY BLAND and way too moist...almost soggy.

Of course I tried to make the banana bread, and like EVERYONE has discovered it spills out of the pan and takes forever to bake (I read on their website that you are only supposed to fill the loaf pan half way...maybe they should put that in the book). The first time I made it it was overdone on the outside while still being goopey on the inside...so I decided to try putting the batter in muffin tins instead and it was perfect! I'd suggest making banana muffins our of your banana loaf batter...it's much better :)

I've made both the sugar sweetened brownies and the agave ones. They are both moist and tasty, but the sugar sweetened ones (of course, the ONLY recipe in the book with white sugar) were my favorite of the two.

I've made the gingersnaps, chocolate chip cookies and double chocolate chip cookies. One thing they all have in common is that they usually come out pretty flat (which I don't mind because I like a crispy cookie). The gingersnaps are ALWAYS good, the plain chocolate chip are OK but usually end up too well done around the edges...but the double chocolate chip cookies are AMAZING every single time I make them!!! They are so moist and chocolaty and perfect, definitely worth the effort every time!

I've never made any of the spelt recipes because they are NOT gluten-free, and they don't sound too good anyway.

Overall I guess it was worth the money for me considering how many times I've baked the double chocolate cookies...but their are definitely pros AND cons to this book.",One person found this helpful,0

UPDATED REVIEW -
The photography in this book is really nice. The celebrity reviews/endorsements are strange and seem to make the book try too hard. The allergen-free reference isn't quite exact, if you're gluten intolerant then a lot of recipes aren't for you.

However, I did click around the BabycakesNYC website and came across an email address they created specifically for cookbook questions. I got a prompt response about subbing out the Spelt flour along with suggestions for other kinds of oils I can use instead of Coconut, which is expensive.

I was little disappointed at first when I thought I couldn't bake all the recipes in Chapter Two and some of the cupcakes I wanted to try, but knowing now that I can sub out the flour and add Xanthan Gum I'm not as unhappy.

I received the Babycakes cookbook as a gift, and was excited to try some new twists on vegan recipes for desserts. I opted to make the red velvet cupcakes with vanilla frosting. After blowing probably $25 on ingredients I wouldn't normally use (coconut flour, soymilk powder, coconut oil), and after following the very detailed (maybe a little preachy?) instructions both in the recipes and in the beginning of the book, I ended up with bland, dry cupcakes and a container full of oily sludge flecked with coconut. I composted the whole batch and will not be trying any other recipes in this book! Specific criticisms include: 1) The recipes are not gluten free. I am not gluten intolerant, but if you're going to scroll 'gluten free' on the cover of your cookbook, that's a pretty serious statement for people who ARE gluten intolerant! Not something to mess around with... 2) Coconut oil comes in various varities, such as virgin, extra virgin, etc. No where in the cookbook is the question of which type to use addressed. 3) Coconut oil is solid in the jar. When a recipe calls for, say, 1/3 of a cup of coconut oil, how should one measure it out? Melt it first and measure it as a liquid? Or fight to chip it out of the jar and then pack it down into the measuring cup? This is another issue that wasn't addressed anywhere. 4) Coconut oil tastes like, well, coconut. The vanilla frosting was way too coconut-flavored for my tastes, thanks to the coconut oil and coconut flour. 5) After poking around online, I've seen lots of comments claiming that the vanilla frosting recipe used at the bakery is not the same as what's in the book. I can only really think of 1 reason why the original recipe isn't shared here. If you don't want to give away your trade secrets that's fine, but then why go on to pretend like you are?

Given all the people who seem to love the bakery, I was really disappointed that none of the recipes worked out for me.",2 people found this helpful,0

I had enjoyed a ""gluten-free"" (or at least I was told it was gluten-free) red velvet cupcake at the BabyCakes bakery in Orlando, FL, and anxiously came home and got the cookbook when I saw red velvet listed in the table of contents. But this is one of the recipes that uses spelt flour :(",,0

I thought it was me, but then a friend who is an experienced pastry chef gave it a go and also got poor results. The directions are very brief and leave out critical steps. e.g. the frosting (which, as the previous reviewer mentioned is not the one used in the bakery) comes out weirdly gritty every time. I just learned -- because I went online and read Erin's blog -- that in any recipe that calls for coconut oil you are supposed to melt it before using. I went back and read every reference to coconut oil and nowhere in the book does it say to melt it first. EPIC FAIL. This book is a cheap PR stunt.",8 people found this helpful,0

I have been baking gluten-free for several years, made the cinnamon-apple toastie cake. The recipe must be incorrect. The batter is very watery and did not even bake all the way through. So, was a disaster. Proceed with caution.",15 people found this helpful,0

I've tried a few of the recipes and they're ok...if you can afford agave nectar and coconut oil in copious amounts. For me, even buying in bulk is too spendy-I bake every day or other day at least! So for now, unfortunately, it's back to substituting spelt in all my vegan baking recipes. I had higher hopes.
A word on the Gluten Free all-purpose flour: I don't like sweet things-I halve the sugar in almost all my recipes-but in the recipes that call for this stuff, you really need it. It's nasty. I don't like loading more sugar into a recipe to hide the taste of the flour, even if it's agave nectar and supposedly better for you.",One person found this helpful,0

I was looking for sugar-free recipes, and found that only one of the recipes in this book was actually low on sugar - all other recipes call for heaps of agave. A more appropriate title description would have been ""refined-sugar free"". A good book for vegans though, and those who look for inspiring pictures and cute desserts when baking.",,0

Everything I made was inedible and I have baked for years!,Format: Hardcover,This book is horribly misleading and the author has admitted to not putting the recipes she uses in her bakery. I spent a small fortune on ingredients only to have everything baked come out disgusting. I also made the frostings which were a sweet mess and did turn in to anything resembling creamy. This isn't the 1990's when you were vegan and everything tasted like crap! Now days there are so many options and much better books such as Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World.

More than that though, it's just not very good. I've now made 7 of the recipes. Before I learned my lesson, I tried a couple of them more than once. I wouldn't make a single one of them again as printed. Three produced something that looked edible. None of them produced anything that humans should consume.

I'm a good baker. I've made some very good gluten free and/or vegan baked goods. None of them came from this cookbook.

Seriously, I don't believe these recipes were tested before the book was printed.",2 people found this helpful,0

There are numerous comments from 'famous' people in adoration of Erin and her baked goods. They all say 'follow the recipes exactly as she tells you'. Well I did and I think her method of only using agave nectar and coconut oil does not end up in a good product.

Not to mention $$$$ if you think you're going to make these things on a weekly basis.

You may have success with her recipes, but I found them to be flops from someone who is so highly acclaimed.
