Shockey and Christopher Shockey,Format: Paperback,"Vegetables are a mainstay in the majority of all recipes and many items at restaurants and cafes. There are many vegetarians and vegans who incorporate vegetables into their daily eating and diets for nutritional value and mainly because vegetables taste good and are good for you.

Fermented Vegetables teaches you the basics in preparing vegetables for brining, pickling, storage and the reason for fermenting. Part 1: Dipping into the Brine explains the fundamentals of fermentation for preservation of vegetables. Some of the perks of fermenting are enhancing the nutrients of Vitamins B and C aiding digestion and supporting the immune system. Chapter 2: The Inner Life of Pickling includes a section on lactose fermentation and using slat, no salt, and butter. Chapter 3: Crokcs and Rocks covers tools of the trade such as coverings, jars, onggi pots, and food processors.

Part 2: Mastering the Basics lists a safety checklist, and also include Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 : Mastering Sauerkraut, Mastering Condiments, Mastering Brine Pickling, Mastering Kimchi Basics, and Practical Matters respectively. Part 3: In the Crock, Fermenting Vegetables A-Z lists vegetables with instructions for pickling, brining, how to create your own recipes with sharing suggestions for serving. Part 4: On the Plate offers recipes for breakfast, snacks, lunch, happy hour, dinner and dessert. There is an Appendix: Scum, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly and a Resource Guide for any further research you deem necessary.

Fermenting Vegetables is a good addiction to any kitchen cookbook shelf filled with very useful information and great recipes for all amateur chefs and everyday cooks. I plan to try pickling and brining my favorite vegetables adding to my cooking skills.

I love fermented foods, could live on them, and eat a lot when I have it, but this amount is toxic in even one serving, in my opinion. I followed the recipes. It made my food so salty and acidic, I had to throw it all out, all ten jars.

I started fermenting before I bought this book. I have a few conditions that probiotics foods and probiotic capsules and loose starter help - actually, to literally survive. When I started fermenting, I started by using the probiotic capsules I had, as a fermentation ""starter"" from Mercola Brand's ""Complete Probiotics."" I opened the capsules about one to a quart jar of fermented food. Mercola also has a loose probiotic starter of the same bacteria, called Kinetic culture (intended for fermenting vegetables) which is basically the same product. You can use any probiotic brand of your choice, provided it doesn't have any additives, like sweeteners, emulsifiers, etc.

Before getting this book, I had used a fraction of salt that these recipes in the book called for (that's the most salt I could tolerate) but I also added about a capsule or less of the Mercola's probiotic capsule, which is a 10 bacteria, 35 Billion count capsule. For two years I got nothing but great fermentation that was good tasting, not salty tasting, and very beneficial. During that time, my wife made natural fermentation of organic string beans, Kimchi, Carrots, Cabbage, (all except Kimchi was not mixed with other vegetables) with ""brine"" (salt solution) of about 1 teaspoon per quart of water. This solution is then poured into jars with vegetables cut and packed for fermenting. I would sometimes add the probiotic. It always came out great and beneficial, with or without the probiotics. In the beginning, I used no salt at all, just probiotic starter, and it came out good and beneficial.

My wife and I thought the amount of salt here in thes recipes and brines was really strange according to our experiences, but I decided to give it a go, ""by the book"" and ended up throwing away everything after everything was all too salty, too acidic, and frankly unpalatable. So much salt that would kill even the friendly bacteria, which was always my concern when I used the probiotics. The addition of a little salt makes friendly plant bacteria and the probiotics work a little better, but too much salt kills ALL the bacteria, friendly or not.

Maybe that's why the author put so much salt in the recipes, to thwart liability claims if an unfriendly bacteria kills somebody. Who knows? There is a section in the book where the author insinuates that you have to find your own salt level. People who use fermented foods in small amounts as a condiment once or twice a day, may like it that salty, but it doesn't make sense to my wife and me how anyone can make a useful beneficial fermentation with so much salt.",54 people found this helpful,0
