1,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,"Prepare to laugh, cry, love, and ponder...",Format: Hardcover,"I preordered this in January and it arrived today, the day the book was released. I've followed Esther on FB for so long, that Steve and Derek feel like friends that I wave to everyday as I leave the house. Even tossed a few dollars into the fund to help buy the sanctuary, holding my breath, watching the fund grow higher each day. It's been a wild ride, and certainly a unique story that no one else can tell. Others may own a pig, but that pig isn't going to become a worldwide sensation, get people to donate huge funds for a sanctuary, and turn people into vegans. There's magic at work here. Enter Esther, the girl who made Steve, Derek, and herself a household name. The book is funny, endearing, thought provoking, and reminds us that there are many other animals that are just as loving and intelligent as our current domesticated pets, and that they don't deserve the treatment or fate they receive in this world. You may not go completely vegan after reading the book, but most everything about Esther's story will at least give you pause, a reason to consider things that you didn't think about before. Oddly enough, it was yet another person trying to take advantage of an animal that brought Esther into Steve and Derek's life: a person trying to make a quick buck by selling baby commercial pigs, passing them off as ""mini pigs"". Fate stepped in, Esther was spared a horrific and short life before becoming a package of bacon, and instead became a social media personality that has followers around the globe. No one saw that coming! It helps that her dads have so much personality, and can capture Esther's thoughts and expressions in photos and then write hilarious captions from Esther's point of view. This book is a quick read, very entertaining, and will hopefully make each person ask themselves, ""What can I do to make this world one notch better while I'm here? Even if my actions cannot fix the whole problem, what is my personal decision about partaking in this issue? Am I humane, as well as human?"" Steve, Derek, and Esther have unknowingly immortalized their legacy; their names, this story, and the current animal sanctuary they run will be remembered and loved forever. Do two things different today: donate five dollars to an animal sanctuary, and set a goal to give up eating animal meat three days a week. Your heart, soul, and health will thank you. And, you may find yourself becoming a member of Esther's Army. It feels good to partake in something so positive. Esther's followers are now a massive, global family. Take the first step and come join us. No pressure to change; however, Esther might make you see the world differently, without using any words. Yes, you can indeed be both humane and human. Esther and the boys are blazing the trail to prove that very fact. Great work, guys! You have indeed changed the world for the better.",125 people found this helpful,1
2,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,I give this one FIVE CUPCAKES!,Format: Hardcover,"The only way I could be happier with this book is if it had more pages with more wonderful tales of our favorite porcine princess…I’ve been following Esther, her dads and HEEFS for a while now on social media and, I love everything about them and their story. At the heart of it all is a beautiful girl that we’ve all gotten to know through daily pics, videos and stories that make us feel like part of the family – we’ve been granted the unique privilege of daily access to the Wonder Pig and all her mint-sucking, bed-hogging, pool-crushing, tulip-bulb-digging, stick-carrying, wind-passing glory. And, just when we thought we knew everything, and that we couldn’t possibly love her or her dads more…along comes the book. It’s hysterical, heartwarming, thought-provoking and quietly powerful…it will make you think…make you cry…make you smile and laugh out loud (many times). It’s the story of Esther the way it should be told…with love and humor in every page.",59 people found this helpful,1
3,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,BEST book I have EVER read!!! Esther is Enchanting!!!!,Format: Hardcover,"Thank you doesn't begin to describe my gratitude for sharing your (and Esther's) story. I absolutely LOVE this book!!! I laughed, I cried, I laughed some more and I nodded like a crazy woman when I've found myself in such similar situations I had to read it to my husband and then to my son who found the similarities uncanny and laughed with me!
Esther has been a big part of my life over the last year. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety and Esther ALWAYS brings me out of the darkness with her kindness and humor! My diet has also changed thanks to her and I am so happy to be a part of The Esther Movement! Thank you a million times over to sharing her with the world and writing this amazing book that continues to give me, and so many other humans and animals alike, hope for tomorrow!",62 people found this helpful,1
4,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,A rare treat,Format: Hardcover,I have been following Esther the Wonder Pig since the beginning of their fb page. I loved the quirky posts and her adorable face. I was so emotional when their farm was purchased and I saw pics of Esther walking around open spaces. This book gave me a deeper understanding of the sacrifices and the deeply difficult choices her two dads had to make to keep her in their lives. I learned that you can commit to something and work every second to make it a reality. I loved reading every word and felt absolutely more in love with this family. The book was well written and so funny. Like laugh out loud funny. And so interesting. I got it at 1 pm today and started reading. I just finished it. Page turner. Thank you for sharing your story with us. Its added value to my life. My perspective.,41 people found this helpful,1

6,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,"Enjoyable and easy read, for those of us who love Miss Esther and her dads!",Format: Kindle Edition,"I have been following Esther the Wonder Pig on Facebook for about 7-8 months now. Her personality as portrayed by the dads, who know her well, is both funny and educational. I welcomed the opportunity to find out how it all started and to follow her current adventures! And you cannot exclude Miss Esther's siblings from different mothers! Makes the family complete! This book is an easy read, I bought the e-book and read it this afternoon. I appreciate Steve and Derek sharing freely the emotional roller coaster that came from making a 'mini pig' part of the family and how they held on fast refusing to let go of their 650 pound little girl! I highly recommend this book and recommend you follow Esther the Wonder Pig on Facebook!",40 people found this helpful,1

Thank you for such a great book.

9,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,A Modern Day Fairy Tale Come True,Format: Hardcover,"This is a book I've been waiting for since long before Esther's dads decided to write it. I've been following their story from the start of the Facebook page creation, and I've got to say I'm completely smitten with the two handsome and noble knights and the beautiful princess, who once out of danger of the fate of so many of her kind, is no damsel in distress. She is in charge! How many of us can say we have changed the lives of the people who love us as completely as these two men have changed theirs for their sweet Esther? This book allows all Esther's fans to get an even deeper insight into her life and story. It moved me to tears and made me laugh out loud at the gym while on the bike so that I was able to tell all of the startled people around me to buy this book! I can't wait for the sequel. I live an Esther approved life, and I work hard at advocating for all of our fellow earthlings, but nobody does it better than this trio. Long live Princess Esther and her smiling knights in crocs! P.S. The book is pink. How perfect is that?!",13 people found this helpful,1

I’ve followed Esther and her dads for quite some time now. I’ve always enjoyed their Facebook page. My sister (who lives with a 270-pound ‘mini’ pig herself) talk at least a couple times each week about Esther and her dads. We are in awe. This book offered a behind-the-scenes account of the past couple years and the amazing journey they have embarked upon. It is truly a wonderful story with many moments that will make you tear up or laugh out loud. It’s a great book that should make each reader pause and at least ponder how we can do better.

I am bias because I already love Esther, her Dads, the dogs and all of the farm but reading this book was a true delight. I already knew most of Esther's story but the added insights never shared before on social media were a fun read. The book brings both out loud laughs as well as worries and also happy tears. If you know Esther or just want to read a heartwarming story of two men and their pig then I highly recommend this book. It is a must for any Esther fan.",28 people found this helpful,1
14,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,The Esther effect and the glory,Format: Hardcover,"Amazing story of Esther, family, and following your heart. I started following Esther when she was still living in an apartment. I remember when they raised funds to move out to the country where they could have more space, and rescue more animals. I remember contributing and watching people all around the world contribute. In no time, they had reached their goal. Esther's story pulls on the heart strings and reaches people far and wide. She has been responsible for many people changing the paradigm of how they view animals. As a vegan, this makes me so happy the effect she has had on the world - the Esther effect. Our society treats pigs -- one of the most intelligent animals, who also have empathy, and behave in many ways just like dogs -- in a horrific manner. It is heartening to see how wonderfully Esther and all pigs at sanctuaries are treated. It is the only ethical way to treat a pig. They deserve love, respect, and most importantly, to not be the victim of violence.",8 people found this helpful,1

If you don't feel the love they have for Esther coming through the page, then you need to go back and re-read. I finished the book within hours of getting it!",12 people found this helpful,1
16,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,A Beautiful Book About a Beautiful Family!,Format: Hardcover,"I have followed Esther and her family on Facebook since just before they raised money to purchase their farm. They now have thousands and thousands of followers, but I will always be so proud to know that I was one of the first few hundred or so. I remember that I just didn't see HOW we were ever going to raise the money at first! In the last week of the fundraiser, I was checking the donation amounts each HOUR!!! I have sent homemade ""Pig Bones"" and Mint Girl Scout cookies to them and this is my favorite non-profit group! I wish they could get on Amazon Smile as a charity in the US. This book is FUNNY and exhilarating and TRUE! It is so funny to read all the inner emotions that Steve was going through and how Derek had a few doubts at first. The work that has gone into the farm has been amazing, but it is is true testimony as to what can actually be accomplished in this world when we all work together!!",9 people found this helpful,1
17,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,OMP! Fantastic!,Format: Hardcover,"I fell in love with Esther and her Dads rather quickly when I started following Esther on Facebook about a year ago. Esther’s super witty and light-hearted posts make me laugh every day! I knew I had to read the book. As an animal-loving vegetarian (almost-there vegan), I really connect with Steve and Derek's message and way of living. Plus, they are really fun guys! I thoroughly enjoyed their story. The details in the book and the style in which it was written make for such an enjoyable read. The pages kept turning and I found that I finished this book faster than any book I’ve ever read. It really is the story of Esther and how she came to be their pig, and not a preachy “You must become a vegan!” book. However, if you are open to it, it will make you think about your choices. Their story is a great example of not giving up on your dreams, no matter how impossible they may seem, and living your life with love, compassion and humor.",5 people found this helpful,1

Steve and Derek are wonderful people with big hearts and it shows. I love Esther and get story. This book puts you right there in their living room as if you are family. I wish we could hear more stories from this loving family. I have to say I couldn't put it down and read it cover to cover in one sitting and I was late to work the next morning all because of Esther.,9 people found this helpful,1
19,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,Esther Is The Princess of Pigs.,Format: Hardcover,"Edited 6/10/17:

The paperback edition arrived last week. I got 4 of them to give as gifts and also because there are recipes in it, an epilogue, and a Q&A with the dads. Esther and her dads are, with the simple act of adopting a ""mini pig,"" changing the world into a kinder more compassionate Esther-approved place where all lives matter.
-------------------------------------------------
I knew of Esther and Steve and Derek and Shelby and everyone before I read the book. I thought I pretty much knew everything that would be in it, because I've followed them on Facebook for a long time. I was so wrong!

The intimate -- sometimes sad; sometimes halarious; sometimes embarassing -- details that Steve and Derek, and helped wonderfully by Caprice Crane since neither of them are authors, were heartwarmingly authentic.

I cried. I laughed. I cried again and laughed again. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment. I was sad when I finished, but only because I wanted more.

The only complaint I have -- and it has nothing to do with the subject, the authors, the style -- is that the edition I got had been Americanized. I think that's a real shame. Steve, Derek, and Esther are Canadian, yet all the little Canadian touches had been removed. This was very disappointing, and it made me feel as though the editor thought that Americans would be put off by an extra ""u"" here or there or the mention of a Canadian athlete's name. I feel this is ""dumbing down"" a book that has universal appeal. (Note to publisher: Stop doing that!)

I would recommend this book to anyone of any age group and to anyone who says they love animals but really mean they love *some* animals. When you finish the book, you may find you love more animals than you thought.",4 people found this helpful,1

Well, inside the pages of Steve Jenkins and Derek Walter's new book, written with Caprice Crane, you'll find the story of Esther, the mini pig that was, well, a big pig.

Steve and his partner Derek are animal lovers. They were living with a pair of dogs and cats in their home in a large urban area in Ontario when an old high school friend of Steve's contacted him. (After 15 years of no contact...)

"" Hey Steve. I know you've always been a huge animal lover. I have a mini pig that is not getting along with my dogs. I've just had a baby and I can't keep the pig.""

Uh huh. So combined with that 15 years and the words 'mini pig', alarms should be going off right? Nope - Steve ends up meeting the woman and bringing home the cute little animal. It's the word 'huge' in that email that is quite prophetic. 'Esther' isn't a mini (surprise!) - instead, she ends up being a full blown commercial size pig. Yes, a 650 pound pig in a 1000 sq.ft. home!

I really enjoyed Steve's voice - I suspect he would be a hoot to meet in person. He's passionate, impetuous and downright funny. I found myself laughing out loud many times. Derek seems to be a bit calmer and more practical. But their love for Esther is the same.

Loving a full sized pig does bring some inevitable changes - physically, mentally and lifestyle. How those changes occurred and how they literally affected and inspired hundreds of thousands of people is a wonderful, heartwarming tale. Esther's story will bring a smile to your day, have you taking a second look at where your food comes from, perhaps inspire you to investigate a vegan lifestyle, support rescue operations and more.

Oh, and my book has a nice little blurb from Ricky Gervais: ""Funny, moving, and heartwarming. The greatest love story ever told between two men and their pig."" Yup, that about sums it up. A fun read that will leave you smiling.",25 people found this helpful,1
973,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,"Sweet, warm and funny",Format: Hardcover,"I received this book as an ARC from Netgalley.

Esther is a 600+ pound pig who is internet famous. She has more followers than most people. If you google “Esther the pig” you’ll find her everywhere. This is the story of how it all happened.

Steve is a sweet young guy, living with his partner Derek, two dogs and two kitties in a 1,000 sf apartment. Pretty normal, right? He loves all creatures, always has, so when an old friend he hasn’t heard a peep from in 10 years gives him a ring, begging him to provide a home for her “micro-pig”, he agrees to meet her. He, of course, ends up going home with the cute little piggie - without consulting his partner. And my husband thought he had it bad when a kitten suddenly appeared in our bathroom one night. Being sneaky NEVER pays off because that evil cat loves him and only him and I guess it serves me right.

As Derek and Steve are adjusting to life with a pig in an apartment where livestock is not allowed, they both come to the realization that Steve’s long-lost “friend” is a big, lousy liar. The cute little piggie they name Esther grows and grows and grows.

But she has a name and a personality and she has become a part of the family.

Uh oh! Now, what are they going to do?!

The book documents the quirks and events that happen when one lives with a full grown pig. Things are broken, food is snatched and rivers of pee are unleashed but somehow they stay strong and make it work. Derek and Steve’s eyes are opened to the horrors of factory farming and realize they can no longer eat bacon without seeing Esther’s face.

It’s sweet and warm and funny and never gets preachy. There are even a few vegan recipes at the end for anyone interested in trying it out. If you want a feel good, true story with a happy ending this is a good one.",6 people found this helpful,1
974,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,Esther and the Huge Heart,Format: Hardcover,"ESTHER! I read the book in one day, I started Saturday morning, and I could not set it down. The book brings to life three accomplices and their big as life love story, all with humor and heart. Esther, the micro pig that had nothing mini about her, and her adoptive fathers, Derek and Steve tell us a story of heartwarming growing love. Their adventure after letting Esther into their lives begins a kindly transformation that gives profound meaning and change of direction to their lives. The 600lb commercial pig begins to blur the line on our love for animals and their painful journey to our table. Steve speaks in a funny and sincere voice about Esther's hilarious escapades. I found tears in my eyes. And above all else the gentle reminder from Esther that comes through about the love and empathy we have for animals and how could we kill them for food. Oh, and please remember that there are some truly Esther Friendly recipes at the end, such a cute bonus because they are really good. So get this book, curl up in a corner, send everyone away, get a glass of wine and read a wonderful compassionate book that will caress your heart. Anne Val",3 people found this helpful,1

Rule: Never trust someone who tells you it is a Mini Pig.
It was not a bad thing that Esther turned out to be a full size 600 pound pig. She was just about 550 pounds more than expected. She was a handful and they learned the hard way/hilarious many times. Their laughter, tears and frustrations during their growth and learning of how to be adopted pig parents was a beautiful and sometimes heartbreaking thing to watch. Derek and Steve are two amazing men, with huge open hearts, and they give it their all to make the world a little better.

979,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,"QUEEN ESTHER,",Format: Hardcover,"I am an Esther fan, so I am biased. This is a story about two guys who looked into the eyes of a forlorn baby ""mini pig"" , felt an instant need to protect and love her . ( Well Dad Steve was instant! Dad Derek took a little while .) Their tale of adapting to a pig in the house , learning she was smarter than , yet just as loving as their pampered pups, Shelby and Rueben , is funny, heart warming, and eye opening. How this love changed their way of looking at all animals is a testament to what we fans and Esther's dads refer to as ""The Esther Effect"". That Esther turned out to be a BIG girl, 650#, caused many problems, the same ones faced by most who adopt a pig. Sadly most are given up. (The dads continually tell people to not be conned into getting a ""mini pig"".)Their absolute determination to give Esther the life she deserves led them to jump with both feet into buying an idyllic, but tired farm , partially funded by 1000s of Esther 's Facebook fans in a 2 month on line fund raiser . The frustrations, joy, laughter, confusion, worry, and shear terror they felt are openly shared. I found my self laughing, crying, chuckling, and cheering them on even though I already knew the outcome. These wonderful men have changed their lives becoming vegan, moving to the country, one even basically leaving a career for the love of ""Queen Esther "" .They have started Happily Ever Esther Farm Sanctuary, where volunteers love to help out, FBook fans donate, and also buy many Esther Approved goodies. All help with the care and feeding of lucky, previously abandoned, unwanted , or old farm animals who call HEEFS their forever home. They continue to share their story daily though humor, love, and gentleness with Esther's World Wide FB fans, which now number in 100s of thousands. You can just hear Dad Steve telling this charming story of love for all animals . This is not a children's book, it is an adult tale told by Dad Steve with adult language . There has to be a sequel to tell about the antics of the 30 some residents as well as the experiences these ""City Boys"" have had becoming old farm house owners and large farm animal caretakers over night.

980,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,"A funny, beautiful love story that reminds us that all lives matter.",Format: Paperback,"This is a very enjoyable read. I’ve been following Esther on Facebook for awhile but I didn’t know how she came to be adopted by Steve and Derek and I’d never have imagined what it would be like to try to keep such a large animal in a small home. Remember the episode of the old Dick Van Dyke show where Laura hides in a closet to open a package that turns out to be a six man, self-inflating raft? It’s a bit like that, just as funny, way, WAY messier.
I’d like to commend Steve and Derick for keeping both this book and Esther’s Facebook page light and unpreachy. They wisely step back and let Esther’s charm work it’s magic on others the way it did on them. Never under estimate the influence humor and love. There was a moment or two in this book that I dreaded we were headed towards a horrifying description of meat and dairy industrial practices. They never went there, thank God. There are plenty of resources for anyone who wants to know. I already know. I appreciated their letting this be a fun story with a happy ending that let me sleep at night.

983,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,A funny and sweet tale,Format: Paperback,"I won this book as part of a Goodreads First Reads giveaway.

The mini pig that wasn’t. This is the true story of Steve Jenkins and his partner Derek Walter and how they acquired, and had their life changed, by Esther, a 650 lb. commercial pig.

I don’t hand out 5 stars very often, but this book was just too entertaining for me to give it less than that. If you don’t know who Esther is, do yourself a favor and look her up. I’ve been following her for quite some time now so when I saw this book listed in a giveaway, I didn’t hesitate to enter. Luckily I won. There are some people I noticed that state they feel this book is very vegan preachy. I honestly didn’t get that. I am not a vegan nor do I have any intention of becoming one and I didn’t feel a push from the book to do that. Did they mention it? Of course they did. Did they discuss why they chose that path? Naturally. Did it fill pages upon pages and come off as militant? Not even close. What I read was a book about how life can take a completely different turn than you expected. It was about acquiring a dream you didn’t even know you had. It was about family and unconditional love. It was about two guys and a pig. A very large pig. I laughed, I cried, I cringed, and I applauded. It was well writing and brimming with emotion and humor. It was one of the better memoirs I have ever read. Definitely a must read for all animals lovers.",,1
984,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,I Fell In Love With Esther,Format: Paperback,"I could not resist reading a book about a wonder pig. So I was delighted to win this book from GoodReads. At first I thought that Esther was a micro pig and so did the author Steve Jenkins when he adopted her. But apparently the truth was that she is a commerical pig. I had plenty of them at the Indiana State Fair's that I have attended. They are in no way small. This story of how Steve and his partner feel in love with Esther is so sweet. I have heard that pigs are very smart and his stories bear that out.

The problem of how to take care of Esther grew as she grew, she kept needing bigger and bigger beds and then there was the problem of taking care of her messes. Also the two later realized that they mat be in trouble with the law as far a keeping her. Loving Esther made them think about the bacon that they occasionally ate. It would be like eating Esther! I am a vegetarian and am so glad that they made the change in diet for the same reason that I did.

I loved this book, It was refreshing to read about someone who came to the same conclusion that I did and I am also sad that I reached the end of the book. But now I can check in on Esther's website and renew my love for her.

I received this finished copy from the publisher as a win from FirstReads but that in no way influenced my thoughts or feelings in this review.",,1
985,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,Animal lovers will be tickled pink with this book.,Format: Kindle Edition,"I am familiar with Esther. I have seen pictures of her on her Facebook page. Yet, I have not been a follower of her's since the beginning. So, it was a treat to get to see how it all began. I have raised chickens and turkeys; yet I can't imagine raising a full commercial size pig.

I had to laugh when Steve accepted Esther and was thinking of ways to ease Derek into the idea. When I was younger, my mom, sister, and I were at a craft fair. As we left, there in the parking lot was a guy selling black Labrador puppies. The biggest one came wobbling over to us and of course we had to take the puppy home. When we got home, my mom told my sister and I to wait in the car with our new puppy while my mom went to tell my dad. My dad was not keen on the idea but in the end, he end we kept the puppy and he even named her. Pepper. They had a bit of a love/hate (more like battle of the minds) relationship but they were really close to each other.

Instantly, I fell in love with Esther. She is a queen. Yet, Esther may be the star of this book but it would not have been if not for Steve and Derek. Additionally, I fell in love with them as well. They are like ying and yang. So happy that Esther has found her ""forever"" home. Animal lovers will be tickled pink with this book.",,1

A lot of writers would have sugar coated things to make themselves seem more perfect, but this one didn't, and owned all of his ""bad behavior"", and as a result, I was much more able to connect with him and feel like I wasn't just an outsider to the story.
I also really liked all the details of Ms. Esther's bad behavior. I could see how it would be tempting as the writer (and piggy dad) to make her seem just wonderful all the time, because people falling in love with this piggy is what he's after, but he didn't do that, and it was appreciated.

Through social media (where I ""met"" Esther) she has touched the hearts of hundreds of thousands of people.

989,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,Esther is Purely Delightful,Format: Hardcover,"https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1455560782/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0

This is truly a fun packed book. Its a true story packed with laughter, love and great stories about how a sweet little bitty 'mini' pig grew and grew and grew a bit more to became a 'huge' center of the lives of a family: Steve and Derek, and became
an inspiration to them and many others.

In addition to inspiring people through her first book, Esther is inspiring others through her Facebook page here: Esther on Facebook

When I saw the title of this book on Net Gallery I immediately requested it for review. I love animals and felt I would enjoy it.

I was right. I laughed, chucked, giggled and even cried at times while reading Esther's tales.

Esther will flat out walk away with your heart: she will fill you up with so much love that you'll be looking for something to share that love with. Luckily I have a daughter at home and 3 birds who are okay with random hugs and declarations of love.

We most not forget Steve and Derek, they are a great part of this and if they were not such wonderful, loving, open hearted people Esther would be, well its not worth thinking about what could have happened.

I like that no agenda is shoved down your throat, you're not lectured to and you're still an okay person even if you're not a vegan. I am not, I tried for 2 years but its just not my thing.

I'd like to say one thing over and above my review. Taking care of Esther, is a huge financial burden on Steve and Derek. Its mentioned in the book in subtle ways as it should be.

I bought a copy of the book after receiving the ARC with the option of leaving a review. I did this in support of what Steve and Derek are doing for Esther, and the other animals. I believe their heart is in the right place and I wanted to help
support them. Whether you do or not, is up for you to decide.

In any case, the book is a delight to read, and I highly recommend it.

In case its not clear: I received a free copy of this book from Net Gallery in exchange for the option of posting my honest review. I choose to post my honest review without any further contact from anyone at Net Gallery or from the publisher.

990,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,"A genuine, lovely tale that will make you grin!",Format: Hardcover,"What a great read this is! It's sweet, funny, honest and heartfelt. Steve and Derek are wonderful dads and they hold nothing back when telling Esther's story... THEIR story. It's just such a genuine feel. I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who is curious to learn more about what it's like to live with a 700 lb pig or even if you're just looking for a fun, insightful read! The trials... the tribulations... the love.

I wish all piggies had a happy ending. It's incredible how smart they are. Reading this book really opened my eyes and it breaks my heart knowing how many of these wonderful creatures are locked up in horrid conditions, living a life of pure pain and misery. Like so many others, Esther has made a profound impact on me. Love you, Esther!",2 people found this helpful,1
991,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,Absolutely loved this book!,Format: Hardcover,"I loved it! I read it in one afternoon, I could not put it down. I laughed and cried right along with Steve and Derek in the book. I have followed Esther's facebook page and all of her antics for a year and a half along with people all over the world and I was so excited to hear they had written a book, I could not wait to get it. And it did not disappoint. I fell in love with this most unusual family all over again. Steve and Derek have truly shown what love is and that family does really come in all shapes, sizes and species! And when you love someone you do whatever it takes in order to stay with them. Even if that someone is a 650 pound commercial pig living in your house who was supposed to be a ""mini-pig"" when you brought her into your home as a tiny baby. Esther has shown the world how smart pigs are and how every animal can have it's own very unique personality and share their love if only given the chance to do so. I hope they write another book sharing their continued stories of life with Esther and all of the other rescued residents at Happily Ever Esther Farm Sanctuary. I will be eagerly awaiting a sequel!",3 people found this helpful,1
992,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,5,Funny and emotive and well written,Format: Hardcover,"A really lovely book with a great message. Written with honesty and humour, it describes the turning upside down of two human lives when they meet a piglet, get to know her and fall in love with her, even as she grows and grows into a full size 'commercial' pig. And over weeks and months, they realise she is smart and loving and filled with personality, just like (or more than) their dogs and cats. So the connection is (somewhat reluctantly) made between the bacon in the pan and the animal they live with and love, and they can no longer eat any of her kind, or her farm friends. Through many (often hilarious) trials and tribulations, they eventually move to the Happily Ever Esther Farm, where Esther and other rescued animals can live in peace, and Steve and Derek can spread the idea that all their lives matter and that all of their new found menagerie respond positively to kindness. I - and my husband - finished the book too quickly.",3 people found this helpful,1

But...social media fame and its inherent automatic sense of importance is an exasperating and now normalized reflection of society today. Everyone has a right to be famous (and funded) and say things that will now be taken as 'inspiring."" What a heavy burden is attention. As usual, this fame is monetized and fans encourage it. It’s not that I’m against their basic intention. It’s just the shallow and vain nature of fame and celebrity. They're doing a nice thing for the pig so I wish it was more about the pig. Too much talk about followers and thousands of strangers and how they were called to make a change. The whole story about ""asking Facebook"" for advice about whether they should go for their dream which became a call for money...lots and lots and lots of money. It's gross, sorry. The audio version probably made it worse to bear. Overly dramatic.

There were portions of the book that literally caused me to laugh out loud. However, the section of the book about creating a Facebook page for Esther and crowdsourcing to raise money to create the rescue was not so interesting. I guess it was a necessary part of the story, but I lost interest as they went into the details of page views and the process of fundraising online. Additionally, I found the language used in the book somewhat offensive --appropriate for social media, but not what I expect from a written book.

1104,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,3,Little pig,Format: Hardcover,"Esther the Wonder Pig is about a small baby pig that two men adopt as their pet. Steve gets a call from an old friend asking him to adopt the pig and that the pig is a miniature pig that won't grow any bigger. Steve is smitten and brings the little pig home to his partner, Derek, and their one thousand square foot home. Needless to say Esther grows and grows some more until she is six hundred pounds and Steve and Derek have to move to a farm.

The book deals with Steve and Derek more than the pig. I wanted more of Esther's antics than the story about Steve and Derek. There are pictures in the book and I wanted to know more about the pictures. For instance, how did all the other animals in the house take to Esther. Do they give Esther daily baths? Esther is in a bathtub in a picture and I wanted to know about how they kept her clean.

Steve and Derek have now turned their farm into a charitable organization for animals that are abused or abandoned. I liked this book and I loved Esther but I wanted more about her and not so much about the two men.

Frankly, I felt sorry for Esther and the inadequate environment she was forced to inhabit. Not only was the home grossly unsanitary but the ""training"" by author & his partner were absolutely unsatisfactory and bordered on cruel. Toward the end of the tale, I got the strong impression that Esther's humans manipulated situation by showcasing Esther and her antics online in order to purchase new property.

1109,Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time,1,Disgusting,Format: Kindle Edition,"It appears that I am the only one who is totally disgusted with this story. Oh well.

I cannot believe that two austensibly responsible educated adults would let a pig urinate all over their home. Leave vegetable oil out where she can smear it over the floors and walls and then dry off in their bed. Damage their kitchen appliances looking for food.

A couple of cats and a dog or two isn't my choice but isn't that bad if you want pets. But to allow your lives to be taken over by any pet is ridiculous. I would never let one of my children rule my house like that pig rules theirs.

Then to take advantage of Facebook followers to pay for your new farm? I'm sorry I cannot wrap my head around this kind of behavior.

Don't misunderstand. My niece owned a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig. It was quite entertaining, but potty trained, well-behaved, and lived in a dog house outdoors. It did not rule the roost. We've had cows, sheep, goats, rabbits, chickens, cats, and dogs. With the exception of one dog and a couple of the cats, they were all out door animals. Well protected against the weather, but still they lived out of doors.

I'd best stop because this has made me quite angry. I am so glad this was a library book and I didn't spend money on it.
