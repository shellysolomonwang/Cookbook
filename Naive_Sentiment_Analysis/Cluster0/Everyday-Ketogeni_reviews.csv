1,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",5,A Kitchen Masterpiece,Format: Paperback,"I just had a chance to sit down for an hour of sheer pleasure, perusing my new cookbook. I've been a devotée of Carolyn's blog for a long time, and this book is a worthy amplification of her daily posts.

The first thing that strikes the reader is the beauty of the photography. Each recipe, on the left page as you open the book, is pictured gorgeously on the opposite page. This is especially important to many who want to know ahead of time what they can expect. Many cooks are visual. Presentations are styled elegantly, most photographed with a minimalist, stylish white background. This book is a feast for the eyes, equal to the feast that the recipes represent.

Carolyn thoughtfully included just what you'd expect of a cookbook that includes the word ""everyday"" in the title. She starts with a primer on ingredients with which the reader will want to stock a low carb pantry, frequently used equipment to make your ketogenic journey easier, and sample menus. From here, she transitions into the recipes. Basics such as broths, marinades, rubs, syrups and sauces start off the culinary love fest. From there, many creative breakfast options are explored, including items many think are verboten on a keto diet, such as waffles, pancakes, fruit syrups, and coffee cake. Carolyn demonstrates that eating keto doesn't mean that common cliché of having to start your day with a dreary parade of eggs, eggs, and more eggs.

Bread substitutes follow, with such delights as skillet ""cornbread,"" Apple Cider Donut Bites, flatbread, scones, and crackers.

The appetizer chapter gets very uptown, with such selections as Grilled Zucchini Rolls With Goat Cheese and Pesto, Bacon and Sundried Tomato Truffles, and Smoked Salmon Pinwheels. Yet more prosaic snacks are well represented, with must-haves, such as graham crackers and nacho chips.

The soup/salad chapter beckons the reader to make such delights as Italian Wedding Soup, Spinach Artichoke Soup, and Fried Goat Cheese Salad.

Meats are the subject of the next chapter, with beef, pork, and lamb selections. Some are gussied up, like Pork Medallions With Browned Butter and Crispy Sage, and reliable faves such as dry rub ribs, pulled pork, and slow cooker kielbasa and cabbage.

Chicken and egg entrées are grouped together with recipes like Cordon Bleu roll-ups, quiche and frittata. There's even a goat cheese soufflé for the stylish!

Seafood is well represented, with many out-of-the-ordinary offerings, like Broccoli Drunken Noodles With Shrimp and Fish Saltimbocca. But those looking for crab cakes or crispy fish nuggets won't be disappointed. The following chapter addressing side dishes is extensive, including directions for making the popular zucchini ""noodles,"" and how to make cauliflower rice. Vegetables get roasted, baked, and deep fried.

Although Carolyn knows her stuff on every one the preceding subjects, her real forte is in amazing her readers with a never-ending parade of delicious desserts. So many think that keeping low carb means bidding adios to yummy desserts. Carolyn is adept at dismissing such ill-conceived notions, and this book underscores her talents. I have tried so many desserts on her blog, all with excellent results. Here, she thrills the reader with mousses, cheesecakes, sauces, ice creams, cookies, and brownies. And, did I mention CHOCOLATE?? No one does it better. Her white chocolate raspberry fat bombs are truly to die for!

The directions are unfailingly clear and accessible, for those who aren't confident of their culinary skills. As a classically trained chef, I find her recipes organized and always methodically presented. This cookbook is more of what I've come to expect of her. Her style is fun and familiar, like you're learning from a friend.

This tome would be a superb gift for the low carb wanna-be to get him/her excited about the possibilities of maintaining a keto lifestyle. They will find themselves up and off the couch, into the kitchen. Moreover, it's a valuable, comprehensive resource for those of us who are old hands. It's even supremely useful for those who want to start on a healthier way of life, and aren't sure where or how to begin. In other words, there is no one who enjoys time in the kitchen who won't welcome this book. It would make a splendid Christmas, wedding, housewarming, or birthday gift. Carolyn isn't preachy. She never tries to proselytize. With recipes such as those contained in this book, she doesn't need to. She has presented a thoughtful, convincing solution. She leads us to the discovery of how to achieve boundless good health. Herein, she demonstrates how easy it can be and IS to keep low carb, simply and deliciously.

Congratulations, Carolyn! You have created a true modern kitchen masterpiece.",175 people found this helpful,1
2,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",5,The Best Keto Coobook EVAH!,Format: Paperback,"This cookbook is the BEST Keto cookbook, Ever! I have already made several recipes and followed Carolyn and her site before. She knows her stuff and makes food fun and delicious again for the whole family! I bought extra copies for friends and will continue to share. I made the butter pecan cookies and the brownies for our Neighbors at Christmas. They loved them. A little tip: if you forget the baking powder in the coconut oil brownie recipe, it turns out to be yummy fudge! A pleasant result. Still have not made with baking powder yet. I really should. I made the cinnamon rolls for a church breakfast and they were a huge hit. I always go to Carolyn’s site when looking for new recipes. It has been wonderful having the cookbook right in front of me. Beautiful pictures. Very easy to understand recipes. Her tips at the bottom of each recipe are extremely helpful. (I did add extra swerve to the brownie/fudge recipe) I have been eating the Keto way for almost 2 years. I have lost 40 pounds. My triglycerides were almost 400, they are down to 138. My blood pressure is normal again. It took one year and four months for my blood pressure to go back to normal, but it is there!!!! All the while, I eat bacon, butter, mayo on pretty much everything. I am not sure what my blood sugar was prior to changing the way I eat, but I am sure it was not good. Being told that I had to go on a statin woke me up to make the necessary changes. I did not take statins, ever. My health changed completely all because of my diet. Thank you, Carolyn for helping me all along the way. ❤️",64 people found this helpful,1

You will not be disappointed. I bought the PC for Kindle version because I could not wait, did not want to wait for delivery. It is packed with recipes that I will use all the time from everyday meals to elegant dinner parties-- appetizers, sides, soups, main dishes, desserts, and more. Unlike some of the other keto or low carb cookbooks written by other authors, the majority of ingredients for the recipes can be bought locally, which is a deciding factor when you live in a small, rural, country town. The cookbook is family friendly, filled with recipes even children will enjoy. Included are perfectly stepped and conveyed instructions with beautiful pictures. Carolyn also adds her personal touches by sharing her life stories, tips, and tricks that she has learned throughout her journey in this WOE.

5,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",5,This Cookbook Brought Me Back To Low-Carb Eating.,Format: Paperback,"I have been following Carolyn on ""All Day I Dream About Food"" for quite some time now. I had great results using her recipes, but left keto low-carb eating a few years ago, with, as you might have guessed, disastrous results; I gained about 30 lbs. So when I decided I'd had enough and was ready to return to ketogenic eating, I was thrilled that Carolyn has come out with a new cookbook. I have to say, I'm very picky about who I embrace as a food blogger. First the recipes have to make sense, and be intelligently written. A big pet peeve is when the ingredients are not listed in order of use. That's a big no-no for me, it's very frustrating to make something and then discover a key ingredient was left out, because it wasn't mentioned until the bottom of the list. Carolyn has never disappointed in that regard. Also I appreciate that she researches her topics and really knows what she's talking about. I have tried so many recipes in this cookbook, it's already got grease stains and water spots on the pages. I had wanted to keep it nice and clean, but if you use a favorite cookbook frequently it will get messy.
My only complaint, and this is just me. Where are some of my favorites from the website? Like, Stromboli, Reubens, Low-carb Nutella, Pavlovas, Almond Crusted Butter Cake, Hungarian Goulash, etc., etc?? Only one thing left to do, Carolyn.....come out with Volume Two! Thanks to the recipes in this wonderful book, and Carolyn's humor and guidance, I've dropped 8 pounds in the past week. It's a good start, with more to come, I'm sure.",30 people found this helpful,1

7,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",5,I LOVE this cookbook,Format: Paperback,"I LOVE this cookbook. I purchased another very popular Ketogenic Cookbook and immediately returned it. I couldn't see myself making more than a few of the recipes - they were way too complicated. This cookbook allowed me to order some ingredients that I saw were regularly used, as well as a few utensils that I knew would be helpful, and I am ready to roll. There's info at the beginning that was a great help in assisting me in reorganizing my pantry. Also many of the recipes I find on line or in the other cookbooks are way too high in protein. This cookbook as a lot of moderate protein recipes included AND it has suggestions for making substitutions for those who may want to prepare a dish without dairy etc. It is really organized well! The recipes look delicious and also seem simple to follow. Thanks Carolyn for this great resource and making it easy for busy professionals like myself. I recommend the Everday Ketogenic Kitchen for anyone looking for great low carb, moderate protein, and high fat recipes!

I actually feel relief that this is the method I have been migrating to after going back & forth between GF & Paleo, but Carolyn did all the work for me & is making the journey attainable-thank you. Please write more books like this that have common ingredients, easy instructions & satisfying taste too.

I was so thrilled that Carolyn Ketchum finally made a keto recipe book! For years I printed-off her awesome recipes from my computer, and longed for an easy to use cookbook. Why? Because her recipes are simply the best tasting low-carb keto friendly recipes out there! Tonight I made the Chocolate Chip Cookies and they are great! I used Lily's Chocolate Chips. (You can get them off Amazon if your health food store doesn't carry them.) She explains that you can use duck fat to make them dairy-free, or if dairy is not an issue you can use butter, and I used butter. I love that she has tips and swaps you can use on many of the recipes. Lots of amazing photos for every recipe. I've bought so many low-carb and keto books over the years, but her recipes are the ones I've made the most because they all taste great! This is my favorite cookbook that I own. All her recipes are tried and true and taste wonderful. Some low carb recipe books have terrible tasting recipes but not this one. Also, she uses Swerve sweetener for a lot of recipes and the swerve tastes better than other Erythritol products I've tried.

I’ve followed Carolyn’s blog for years and have filled notebooks and my iPad with her recipes—recipes I turn to all the time. I feared her cookbook might contain primarily recipes from her site—I should have known better. Nearly every recipe is brand new. The photos are mouthwatering, and so are the finished products. My favorite section is the photo index. Arranged by category, it features a thumbnail pic of every recipe..

There’s only 1 thing missing, a dessert recipe that features pumpkin. But my iPad is stuffed with tried and true pumpkin cakes, pumpkin bars, pumpkin cupcakes, pumpkin everything else from her blog, so it’s easy to get my pumpkin fix.

If you are new to this way of eating, Carolyn gives very clear guidelines on how to stock your pantry and kitchen in the first part of the book.

16,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",5,An honest review,Format: Paperback,"I've been following All Day I Dream About Food author and blogger Carolyn Ketchum, for over a year now. I subscribe to many other low carb and keto bloggers that are also great. My main reason for following her was the low carb desserts she made and the consistently good recipe results I always achieved from her blog. Her blog is well written, consistent in style, content and layout, it's easy to follow and her directions are thorough without unnecessary verbiage. I personally don't like cooking videos unless it's crucial to show unusual steps to achieve an end result. Most are an annoying waste of time and I still need to rely on the written recipe. I appreciate that she keeps hers to a minimum. The book is beautiful, well written, informative about the keto diet, nutrition in general and includes an accurate description of why the modern American diet is so horrendous. You cannot go wrong with this book, it deserves more than the maximum 5 stars.

As I said though, I followed her originally for the baked goods and dessert recipes, because honestly, there are already a ton of fantastic, non dessert recipes on the interwebs. But Carolyn has a unique ability to create solidly consistent desserts that are excellent, not just pretty good, and she does this better (sorry) than all the other low carb bloggers that are very popular. This isn't meant to offend, its just a fact. So, that all said, I was kind of disappointed in the dessert catagory. I expected to see a fair number of some of her most popular desserts like her Apple Coffee Cake with Caramel sauce, etc. But instead there are 3 fatbomb recipes, 1 gummy recipe, chocolate chips recipe, chocolate ganache, chocolate sauce, the latter 3 which are not desserts but dessert condiments. Those could easily have been included as side bars instead of devoting 2 pages for each of them. She did however include a lovely NY Cheesecake, Chocolate Lava cakes for 2 and the Gingerbread cake roll, along with a few others. I know many of her desserts can be printed but it's not at all the same as having them in a beautiful book format. It still deserves high praise, but she also said she wants honest reviews, this is mine.

She has just announced a new book coming out in March 2018 for Easy Keto dinners, which is very exciting. As someone that must eat keto because I am diabetic, new and easy ways to prepare and enjoy food that doesn't harm you, this is welcome news. But not everyone loves Cauliflower, some of us actually loathe the vile plant. Please bear in mind that you have already included no less than 3 Cauliflower recipes in this book. There's also a vast, overabundance of Cauliflower recipes infecting the internet. Thought for Food.",8 people found this helpful,1

But NO. This cookbook is handsdown WONDERFUL. To start with, Ketchum gives an easily-understandable mini-course in the Keto diet in a very readable yet science-based manner. (Since I happen to totally appreciate evidence-based and science-based information, ahem, this portion of the book I love.) Also, the organization is fabulous and easy to use, and the photographs are extremely accurate. I am cooking my way through this cookbook with sheer joy. Many thanks to this wonderful lady for sharing her love of food, her understanding of a busy life, and her obviously vast amount of research with those of us who want optimum health and who love the world of taste and cooking.

The few recipes that require two pages are written on two facing pages - no page turning required while you're cooking. She includes nutritional information for each recipe.

The Easy Taco Pie is fantastic! The recipe serves 8 and there are just 2 of us so I cut it in half and baked it in a 6-inch pie plate. It worked great and we had enough for dinner and delicious leftovers to heat up for lunch the next day.

I've got so many sticky notes on recipes that I'm eager to try, including Creamy Spinach and Mushroom Gratin, Easy Peanut Butter Cups, Apple Cider Donuts, Hamburger Buns, and Sheet Pan Chicken and Veggies. (A friend of mine made the Sheet Pan Chicken and Veggies and said it is outstanding!)

If you have your heart set on cinnamon rolls, don’t use this recipe, it’s so incredibly disappointing; as is the “corn bread” and chocolate crepes. Gross.

That's one of the things I love about Carolyn's recipes, they are adaptable. If you don't have an item, but something similar, the recipe turns out great with the substitution. I have tried out many of her recipes from the book and I have loved them all. Think I'll make her Duck Fat Chocolate Chip Cookies, pages 324 and 325, again. LOVE these.

Pictures are great. Love the picture index in back. I've made the brie mushroom quiche countless times, it is so fricking easy and delicious. I even modified by adding some ham and using zucchini instead of mushrooms and it came out just as good. The lemon poppy seed bread/cake is a replacement for an old high sugar/high carb toxic family treat (I almost cried the first time I made it and realized it was my HFLC replacement). Her recipes are a lot like her blog - simple, real food, low carb, so easy to understand and designed for those of us that don't have hours to spend in the kitchen. This is one of the only cookbooks I've ever purchased that I am still super happy I purchased months later. Disclainer: heavy dairy and I have not tried to sub dairy in recipes for alternatives so can't comment from that POV. I was hesitant to purchase because her blog is so easy to use and save recipes from but I love having the hard copy on my kitchen counter for reference. This purchase is seriously a no-brainer IMO.",2 people found this helpful,1

I've been following Carolyn's blog for years and have loved everything I've made from her recipes, so I was really looking forward to the publication of her cookbook. It does not disappoint!

The recipes are well-written and easy to follow, and I love that the nutrition information is included for each one. Her explanations of ingredients and their roles in low carb cooking and baking are an invaluable reference. And there is a little treat in the back of the book—thumbnails of the photographs for each of the recipes, all organized by chapter and page. It makes it really easy to find the recipes that are in the book without having to page through to remind yourself of what's there.

Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen has quickly become the one I reach for the most. It is well laid out with beautiful photos of each recipe, nutritional and possible substitutions info, and so far everything I've made has been really really good. But where I think this cookbook stands out for me is the collection of baking recipes. Both savory and sweet, scones, breads crusts, desserts, you name it. There is even a recipe here for ""Cornbread"" for crying out loud! No doubt about it, Carolyn can bake like nobody's business! I personally am not a good baker, and low-carb only complicates things for me even more, but I've managed to recreate some recipes and even get my 13 year old to compliment them. Instructions are simple and ingredients are ones you probably already have in your pantry if you've been low-carbing before.

If you are brand new to Ketogenic way of eating, there isn't a whole lot of info here on the science behind it, or an in depth overview of ingredients, good vs bad, only the basic concepts. But if you're starting out and are overwhelmed by the choices of cookbooks out there, I would definitely recommend this one for the recipes alone.",3 people found this helpful,1

There are so many free recipes out there why do I need one!

WELL, LADIES AND GENTS, HOW WRONG WE ARE! YOU NEED THIS COOKBOOK! I took advantage of prime day and snagged this baby with a $5 off coupon (WHOOT WHOOT)

This book has a bit of everything! I'm sold and can't wait to get more of her books! I've been keto for almost a year now and I pretty much have EVERYTHING ALREADY! No need to run out for 10 ingredients for one recipe. They are easy to follow, many are items you would already have on hand, and ALL OF THEM ARE SUPER YUMMY! I can't believe I didn't get this sooner. I could have been eating SO GOOD for even longer! (let's be honest, some of those keto chefs don't know what they are doing.)

The stuffed peppers were okay, nothing amazing (peppers are always runny when you cook them), but the eggplant parmesan is INSANELY good. So far, the dinner recipes have not let us down. I really wasn't interested in the desserts, because I'm trying to curb my sweet tooth, but I think I may try a few of them (hopefully they won't trigger more of my sweet tooth - we shall see). Most of the reviews seemed to be about desserts, so I was very skeptical. I do wish the sample week of keto meals would have been more helpful (not just putting down dinner recipe left-overs for breakfast, shared a detailed coffee recipe, etc.), but I figured it out. FYI, a great coffee/mocha recipe (aka my breakfast): 1 shot of espresso, 1T MCT oil, 2T collagen powder, 2T heavy whipping cream, 1T unsweetened cocoa powder, and 1T swerve sweetener (thank you for the Swerve recommendation!). It's amazing, and I'm not hungry until nearly 1pm!!! (Nearly 5 hours later!). Anyway, I highly recommend the book.

Beautiful photographs, sensible suggestions for substitutions, useful tips to ensure success, together with all the nutritional information so often missed in other books.

I am an avid follower of Carolyn Ketchum's blog and had high hopes for her first cookbook. It did not disappoint. I have been eating keto for just over a year. I started in order to lose 15 pounds that had creeped up. I continue because I feel so much better eating low-carb, low-sugar, and gluten-free. The cookbook has wonderful sections on a ketogenic diet, ketogenic ingredients, and tips for successful ketogenic baking. Then it dives into some seriously delicious recipes. Don't be fooled by the simplicity. Every thing I've made so far has been easy and delicious. My family's favorites so far are Easy Taco Pie, Roasted Cabbage Wedges with Blue Cheese and Bacon, Spicy Shrimp and Cucumber Noodles, Cheesy Cauliflower Grits, and No-Bake Haystack Cookies. And there are many more recipes I can't wait to try. I have no hesitation recommending this cookbook whether you are new to the ketogenic way of eating or an old-hand at it. Carolyn Ketchum is a magician in the keto kitchen and even her most simple recipes result in a satisfying tasty meal that the whole family will enjoy - including those who don't adhere to a low-carb way of eating.",9 people found this helpful,1

So I decided to get this book to help me figure it out. I am so glad I did! I own too many cookbooks to count, but this is one of the best. I read it cover to cover, and was totally impressed with the quality of the editing (I didn't see one typo!); how great the recipes are (There is literally not one I don't think I'd like); and the quality and beauty of the book. Although it is a paperback (no I didn't get the Kindle edition that the review shows), it uses the highest quality paper (It actually weighs over 2.5 lbs!), and every recipe has a beautiful color photo. It is laid out for easy cooking (no recipes spanning to a different page -- I hate that). There is even an index section that has color photos of each item (I've never seen that before). I also appreciated the introductory part that explains differences in various products and recommends some brand named ones, and even what kitchen equipment would be helpful (but not necessary). I was a little apprehensive to start this way of living, but now I think it will be totally doable and tasty. It even lists various keto resources that will be helpful.

Not only does it contain loads of recipes, but there is also a section discussing keto ingredients, one discussing equipment to make keto cooking easier, and even a seven day sample diet. If you're new to eating keto or low-carb, or can only buy one cookbook, this is the one for you!

The book contains loads of recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, beverages, and snacks. There is a large section with breads, muffins, and scones, which are foods that are frequently missed by those on a keto diet. Carolyn has us covered!

Carolyn has made her cookbook a work of art. She uses the same white on white style of photography that she uses in her blog. I enjoy paging through it just to look at the pictures.

In short, I love this book and highly recommend it to those eating low-carb or ketogenic diets.",4 people found this helpful,1
795,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",5,The Best Cookbook I Have Ever Bought,Format: Kindle Edition,"WOW...where do I begin. I was looking for a diabetic cookbook or something that was semi sugar free and low carbs. I was disappointed in the Diabetic cookbook reviews whereas a lot of reviewers complained of high carbs and issues with the recipes. I would think if it was an excellent diabetic cookbook it would adhere closely to true recipes in controlling blood sugars but too many reviews didn't indicate that. Confused again!
In one review tho, Carolyn Ketchums name was mentioned and the review was intriguing. I found the cookbook on Amazon and was impressed by the 5 stars with 500+ reviews and thought it must be really good or Carolyn has a lot of friends. This is where the WOW comes in. I purchased it realizing it was Ketogenic which I had sort of tried before but finding good recipes and understanding actually how to go forward and not knowing what products should I buy turned me off. The information really wasn't there.
In comes Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen. Unbelievably informative. I have never, ever seen a cookbook that literally answers all your questions as you are reading the recipes. She tells you what brand you can buy, and where to buy it. Explains the difference in one oil or the other and why not to substitute Almond flour for Coconut flour. It is better to buy Cacao Butter chips and not a block. The information on sweeteners and which to choose from was a great help. There is so much good information that I have already cleaned out my pantry and have ordered new ingredients. I have never heard of a mozzarella crust for pizza or bread sticks. Recipes for crackers & chips that I will actually be able to make & eat without feeling guilty. The food recipes appear to be very easy to make and look delicious and definitely looking forward to trying them all. This seriously feels like a food bible to me. It has not gone unnoticed that an incredible amount of research and work went into putting this cookbook together. She obviously gave a considerable amount of time thinking what a newbie or seasoned reader would need to use the recipes in her book.
Thank you Carolyn for having the insight to put together a cookbook that is truly fantastic. I also found her blog and I am now a follower. The next best thing will be the Dessert Cookbook coming out in July which I will certainly pre-order! FIVE STARS all the way..",2 people found this helpful,1

I'm getting weary of keto authors going through the basics of ingredients and needed cookware. Wasted space in a cookbook, in my opinion. We know what gadgets to use. Just give us the recipes. There are also not as many recipes in this book as other popular keto cookbooks. Some of the recipes included are extremely basic, Google-type recipes, and are not really not cookbook-worthy. (Pico De Gallo?) The recipes she has on her website and blog posts are better than what were included in this book. This author is capable of so much more, so I was surprised that this book was so basic.",19 people found this helpful,1
797,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",5,Best diabetic/keto friendly recipes available,Format: Paperback,"My daughter has Type one diabetes. I have been cooking Carolyn Ketchum's recipes off of her blog ( All day long I dream about food) for almost 4 years now. The book is great because my daughter loves looking through the colorful book and choosing anything she wants which is huge!!!! The recipe's are not only healthy but to hear my daughter squeek ""Yummy"" makes my mommy heart happy.

I learned a long time ago just because a recipe is on the Internet doesn't mean it's a good one. I have learned to trust Carolyn's recipe's. They are easy to follow, healthy, and always make me look like a great cook.

Some of the things that really stand out in the book are the big bright pages. I love the font size so I don't have to worry about leaning in while I'm cooking. Also she has included a wealth of information on keto-friendly ingredients, low carb sweeteners, swaps and substitutions, huge resource section, and a ton of stuff that took me years or trial and error to learn. There was even some things I didn't know!!!!

Definitely a keeper!!! I'm super happy with my purchase and I can't thank this lady enough. I cried when I read the bit about her not changing a thing. Music to this moma's ears.",2 people found this helpful,1

They're clearly written, the tips for substitutions or meal pairings are great, and there aren't 500 weird ingredients needed for every single recipe. I've bought other low carb or keto cookbooks and while I have enjoyed them, they were full of grammatical errors, layout mistakes, and poor editing. Not the case here. Carolyn knows her stuff regarding keto cooking and concise, accurate communication!

Definitely check out her internet and social media accounts too, you'll find amazing recipes and wonderful support from her and her fans.

800,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",5,Skeptic turned believer - so much low-carb baking goodness and family-pleasing recipes!,Format: Kindle Edition,"This is the best cookbook I have ever had in two ways: 1) the great majority of its recipes are things I'm interested in making and not too complicated for my level of skill and patience, and 2) everything I've made from it so far (and that's a good two dozen recipes) has been great, with just one exception (but my husband did that one, and he's not always the best follower of directions, and it still tasted great, just off on the texture).

I was skeptical about many of the recipes -- light focaccia? Sunflower bread that would really work for toast and sandwiches? New York style cheesecake? I started with the ones that seemed the most credible, and as success mounted on success, I bought some of the more exotic ingredients for the ones I couldn't believe would work. I truly haven't been disappointed yet. Last night I made the pork chops smothered with green chile, and to my surprise even my super-picky-eater son ate as much as he could hold (he cut the spice a bit with sour cream). I'm a believer now.

I will say, read the author's recommendations on ingredients. Zucchini scones made with frozen squash and coarse almond meal instead of fresh/fine ground? Not so special, though still quite tasty! But focaccia made with the recommended super-fine almond meal and unflavored whey protein powder? Really, really nice.",,1

Highly recommend, especially for newbie Keto folks like us!",Format: Paperback,"My family really enjoys all the recipes we've tried so far from this book--and we've tried 23 of them thus far. Recipes are simple & easy--some are pretty basic, as other reviewers have said--but it makes for easy execution! We are v e r y new to this Keto way, & these recipes make it easy to adopt this new way of shopping/cooking, and that makes a difference when you're trying to change the way you eat & think about food. The eating is fun, too, because things are so tasty! (And, I think that has helped a lot because it's been rather easy for the family to embrace this way of eating.) All the dishes we've brought to gatherings, which, so far, have been main dish/appetizer-types, have gotten rave reviews, too.

The many ""bread"" recipes make this cookbook different from other Keto cookbooks we have, & we like that. The Hamburger Buns fluff up nicely, are sturdy, and have nice flavor. The Apple Cider Donut Bites definitely taste better the next day as the flavors seem to meld better (but we didn't have any trouble sampling quite a few the same day they were made!). We also really like the Magic Mozzarella Dough. Oh, and the Coconut Oil Brownies--we're so glad we didn't have to wait for them to come to room temperature after refrigerating them :)",,1

975,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",1,"Recipes are gross, boring & uninspiring",Format: Paperback,"The Keto diet is NOT the answer to the growing problem of obesity, diabetes and other illnesses. Many people have lived long, healthy lives and remained within a ""normal"" weight range their whole lives by eating a wide variety of healthy food (including carbs), in moderation. The problem is people overeat or eat garbage and then turn to diets like Keto as a Band-Aid ""fix"" for their problems.

I'm an experienced cook (40+ yrs) with a wide range of tastes and foods. I'm interested in learning about various ""diets"" and lately I've been interested in the Keto diet but every cookbook I look at, it's the same old - same old. Carolyn Ketchum's book is no different. The recipes are bland, boring, repetitive, uninspiring and reminiscent of recipes in the 50's and 60's where you created ""instant food"" with ingredients you threw together. Just gross. Why not cook everything from scratch using only fresh, wholesome ingredients? (Cream cheese is processed food - sorry to disappoint... and so is shredded Mozzarella with a plethora of additives!) To be fair, the Keto diet is EXTREMELY restrictive in terms of what kinds of fruits & vegetables you can eat (never mind having to omit ALL grains) so that leaves very little in terms of choices for recipe creations. That being said, exactly how much cauliflower, zucchini and broccoli can one eat before one wants to gag? Better yet, before your body gets sick of it (and may even start rejecting it by developing a sensitivity or allergy to it? This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world. Each one provides something our bodies need. Balance is the key, not restrictive diets (with recipes that make you want to gag). To each his own...

1002,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",1,"Recipes are gross, boring & uninspiring",Format: Paperback,"The Keto diet is NOT the answer to the growing problem of obesity, diabetes and other illnesses. Many people have lived long, healthy lives and remained within a ""normal"" weight range their whole lives by eating a wide variety of healthy food (including carbs), in moderation. The problem is people overeat or eat garbage and then turn to diets like Keto as a Band-Aid ""fix"" for their problems.

I'm an experienced cook (40+ yrs) with a wide range of tastes and foods. I'm interested in learning about various ""diets"" and lately I've been interested in the Keto diet but every cookbook I look at, it's the same old - same old. Carolyn Ketchum's book is no different. The recipes are bland, boring, repetitive, uninspiring and reminiscent of recipes in the 50's and 60's where you created ""instant food"" with ingredients you threw together. Just gross. Why not cook everything from scratch using only fresh, wholesome ingredients? (Cream cheese is processed food - sorry to disappoint... and so is shredded Mozzarella with a plethora of additives!) To be fair, the Keto diet is EXTREMELY restrictive in terms of what kinds of fruits & vegetables you can eat (never mind having to omit ALL grains) so that leaves very little in terms of choices for recipe creations. That being said, exactly how much cauliflower, zucchini and broccoli can one eat before one wants to gag? Better yet, before your body gets sick of it (and may even start rejecting it by developing a sensitivity or allergy to it? This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world. Each one provides something our bodies need. Balance is the key, not restrictive diets (with recipes that make you want to gag). To each his own...

1047,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",1,"Recipes are gross, boring & uninspiring",Format: Paperback,"The Keto diet is NOT the answer to the growing problem of obesity, diabetes and other illnesses. Many people have lived long, healthy lives and remained within a ""normal"" weight range their whole lives by eating a wide variety of healthy food (including carbs), in moderation. The problem is people overeat or eat garbage and then turn to diets like Keto as a Band-Aid ""fix"" for their problems.

I'm an experienced cook (40+ yrs) with a wide range of tastes and foods. I'm interested in learning about various ""diets"" and lately I've been interested in the Keto diet but every cookbook I look at, it's the same old - same old. Carolyn Ketchum's book is no different. The recipes are bland, boring, repetitive, uninspiring and reminiscent of recipes in the 50's and 60's where you created ""instant food"" with ingredients you threw together. Just gross. Why not cook everything from scratch using only fresh, wholesome ingredients? (Cream cheese is processed food - sorry to disappoint... and so is shredded Mozzarella with a plethora of additives!) To be fair, the Keto diet is EXTREMELY restrictive in terms of what kinds of fruits & vegetables you can eat (never mind having to omit ALL grains) so that leaves very little in terms of choices for recipe creations. That being said, exactly how much cauliflower, zucchini and broccoli can one eat before one wants to gag? Better yet, before your body gets sick of it (and may even start rejecting it by developing a sensitivity or allergy to it? This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world. Each one provides something our bodies need. Balance is the key, not restrictive diets (with recipes that make you want to gag). To each his own...

If you're into Keto dieting, find regular recipes that you can ""adapt"" to meet your low-carb needs and learn how to cook. You'll be better off than following the recipes in this book (or any Keto cookbook for that matter)",5 people found this helpful,0

That being said, exactly how much cauliflower, zucchini and broccoli can one eat before one wants to gag? Better yet, before your body gets sick of it (and may even start rejecting it by developing a sensitivity or allergy to it? This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world. Each one provides something our bodies need. Balance is the key, not restrictive diets (with recipes that make you want to gag). To each his own...

If you're into Keto dieting, find regular recipes that you can ""adapt"" to meet your low-carb needs and learn how to cook. You'll be better off than following the recipes in this book (or any Keto cookbook for that matter)",5 people found this helpful,0

1146,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",1,"Recipes are gross, boring & uninspiring",Format: Paperback,"The Keto diet is NOT the answer to the growing problem of obesity, diabetes and other illnesses. Many people have lived long, healthy lives and remained within a ""normal"" weight range their whole lives by eating a wide variety of healthy food (including carbs), in moderation. The problem is people overeat or eat garbage and then turn to diets like Keto as a Band-Aid ""fix"" for their problems.

I'm an experienced cook (40+ yrs) with a wide range of tastes and foods. I'm interested in learning about various ""diets"" and lately I've been interested in the Keto diet but every cookbook I look at, it's the same old - same old. Carolyn Ketchum's book is no different. The recipes are bland, boring, repetitive, uninspiring and reminiscent of recipes in the 50's and 60's where you created ""instant food"" with ingredients you threw together. Just gross. Why not cook everything from scratch using only fresh, wholesome ingredients? (Cream cheese is processed food - sorry to disappoint... and so is shredded Mozzarella with a plethora of additives!) To be fair, the Keto diet is EXTREMELY restrictive in terms of what kinds of fruits & vegetables you can eat (never mind having to omit ALL grains) so that leaves very little in terms of choices for recipe creations. That being said, exactly how much cauliflower, zucchini and broccoli can one eat before one wants to gag? Better yet, before your body gets sick of it (and may even start rejecting it by developing a sensitivity or allergy to it? This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late.

1191,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",1,"Recipes are gross, boring & uninspiring",Format: Paperback,"The Keto diet is NOT the answer to the growing problem of obesity, diabetes and other illnesses. Many people have lived long, healthy lives and remained within a ""normal"" weight range their whole lives by eating a wide variety of healthy food (including carbs), in moderation. The problem is people overeat or eat garbage and then turn to diets like Keto as a Band-Aid ""fix"" for their problems.

I'm an experienced cook (40+ yrs) with a wide range of tastes and foods. I'm interested in learning about various ""diets"" and lately I've been interested in the Keto diet but every cookbook I look at, it's the same old - same old. Carolyn Ketchum's book is no different. The recipes are bland, boring, repetitive, uninspiring and reminiscent of recipes in the 50's and 60's where you created ""instant food"" with ingredients you threw together. Just gross. Why not cook everything from scratch using only fresh, wholesome ingredients? (Cream cheese is processed food - sorry to disappoint... and so is shredded Mozzarella with a plethora of additives!) To be fair, the Keto diet is EXTREMELY restrictive in terms of what kinds of fruits & vegetables you can eat (never mind having to omit ALL grains) so that leaves very little in terms of choices for recipe creations. That being said, exactly how much cauliflower, zucchini and broccoli can one eat before one wants to gag? Better yet, before your body gets sick of it (and may even start rejecting it by developing a sensitivity or allergy to it? This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world. Each one provides something our bodies need. Balance is the key, not restrictive diets (with recipes that make you want to gag). To each his own...

Many people have lived long, healthy lives and remained within a ""normal"" weight range their whole lives by eating a wide variety of healthy food (including carbs), in moderation. The problem is people overeat or eat garbage and then turn to diets like Keto as a Band-Aid ""fix"" for their problems.

I'm an experienced cook (40+ yrs) with a wide range of tastes and foods. I'm interested in learning about various ""diets"" and lately I've been interested in the Keto diet but every cookbook I look at, it's the same old - same old. Carolyn Ketchum's book is no different. The recipes are bland, boring, repetitive, uninspiring and reminiscent of recipes in the 50's and 60's where you created ""instant food"" with ingredients you threw together. Just gross. Why not cook everything from scratch using only fresh, wholesome ingredients? (Cream cheese is processed food - sorry to disappoint... and so is shredded Mozzarella with a plethora of additives!) To be fair, the Keto diet is EXTREMELY restrictive in terms of what kinds of fruits & vegetables you can eat (never mind having to omit ALL grains) so that leaves very little in terms of choices for recipe creations. That being said, exactly how much cauliflower, zucchini and broccoli can one eat before one wants to gag? Better yet, before your body gets sick of it (and may even start rejecting it by developing a sensitivity or allergy to it? This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world. Each one provides something our bodies need. Balance is the key, not restrictive diets (with recipes that make you want to gag). To each his own...

If you're into Keto dieting, find regular recipes that you can ""adapt"" to meet your low-carb needs and learn how to cook. You'll be better off than following the recipes in this book (or any Keto cookbook for that matter)",5 people found this helpful,0

This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world. Each one provides something our bodies need. Balance is the key, not restrictive diets (with recipes that make you want to gag). To each his own...

If you're into Keto dieting, find regular recipes that you can ""adapt"" to meet your low-carb needs and learn how to cook. You'll be better off than following the recipes in this book (or any Keto cookbook for that matter)",5 people found this helpful,0

1335,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",1,"Recipes are gross, boring & uninspiring",Format: Paperback,"The Keto diet is NOT the answer to the growing problem of obesity, diabetes and other illnesses. Many people have lived long, healthy lives and remained within a ""normal"" weight range their whole lives by eating a wide variety of healthy food (including carbs), in moderation. The problem is people overeat or eat garbage and then turn to diets like Keto as a Band-Aid ""fix"" for their problems.

I'm an experienced cook (40+ yrs) with a wide range of tastes and foods. I'm interested in learning about various ""diets"" and lately I've been interested in the Keto diet but every cookbook I look at, it's the same old - same old. Carolyn Ketchum's book is no different. The recipes are bland, boring, repetitive, uninspiring and reminiscent of recipes in the 50's and 60's where you created ""instant food"" with ingredients you threw together. Just gross. Why not cook everything from scratch using only fresh, wholesome ingredients? (Cream cheese is processed food - sorry to disappoint... and so is shredded Mozzarella with a plethora of additives!) To be fair, the Keto diet is EXTREMELY restrictive in terms of what kinds of fruits & vegetables you can eat (never mind having to omit ALL grains) so that leaves very little in terms of choices for recipe creations. That being said, exactly how much cauliflower, zucchini and broccoli can one eat before one wants to gag? Better yet, before your body gets sick of it (and may even start rejecting it by developing a sensitivity or allergy to it? This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world.

1380,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",1,"Recipes are gross, boring & uninspiring",Format: Paperback,"The Keto diet is NOT the answer to the growing problem of obesity, diabetes and other illnesses. Many people have lived long, healthy lives and remained within a ""normal"" weight range their whole lives by eating a wide variety of healthy food (including carbs), in moderation. The problem is people overeat or eat garbage and then turn to diets like Keto as a Band-Aid ""fix"" for their problems.

I'm an experienced cook (40+ yrs) with a wide range of tastes and foods. I'm interested in learning about various ""diets"" and lately I've been interested in the Keto diet but every cookbook I look at, it's the same old - same old. Carolyn Ketchum's book is no different. The recipes are bland, boring, repetitive, uninspiring and reminiscent of recipes in the 50's and 60's where you created ""instant food"" with ingredients you threw together. Just gross. Why not cook everything from scratch using only fresh, wholesome ingredients? (Cream cheese is processed food - sorry to disappoint... and so is shredded Mozzarella with a plethora of additives!) To be fair, the Keto diet is EXTREMELY restrictive in terms of what kinds of fruits & vegetables you can eat (never mind having to omit ALL grains) so that leaves very little in terms of choices for recipe creations. That being said, exactly how much cauliflower, zucchini and broccoli can one eat before one wants to gag? Better yet, before your body gets sick of it (and may even start rejecting it by developing a sensitivity or allergy to it? This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world. Each one provides something our bodies need. Balance is the key, not restrictive diets (with recipes that make you want to gag). To each his own...

Many people have lived long, healthy lives and remained within a ""normal"" weight range their whole lives by eating a wide variety of healthy food (including carbs), in moderation. The problem is people overeat or eat garbage and then turn to diets like Keto as a Band-Aid ""fix"" for their problems.

I'm an experienced cook (40+ yrs) with a wide range of tastes and foods. I'm interested in learning about various ""diets"" and lately I've been interested in the Keto diet but every cookbook I look at, it's the same old - same old. Carolyn Ketchum's book is no different. The recipes are bland, boring, repetitive, uninspiring and reminiscent of recipes in the 50's and 60's where you created ""instant food"" with ingredients you threw together. Just gross. Why not cook everything from scratch using only fresh, wholesome ingredients? (Cream cheese is processed food - sorry to disappoint... and so is shredded Mozzarella with a plethora of additives!) To be fair, the Keto diet is EXTREMELY restrictive in terms of what kinds of fruits & vegetables you can eat (never mind having to omit ALL grains) so that leaves very little in terms of choices for recipe creations. That being said, exactly how much cauliflower, zucchini and broccoli can one eat before one wants to gag? Better yet, before your body gets sick of it (and may even start rejecting it by developing a sensitivity or allergy to it? This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world. Each one provides something our bodies need. Balance is the key, not restrictive diets (with recipes that make you want to gag). To each his own...

If you're into Keto dieting, find regular recipes that you can ""adapt"" to meet your low-carb needs and learn how to cook. You'll be better off than following the recipes in this book (or any Keto cookbook for that matter)",5 people found this helpful,0

This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world. Each one provides something our bodies need. Balance is the key, not restrictive diets (with recipes that make you want to gag). To each his own...

If you're into Keto dieting, find regular recipes that you can ""adapt"" to meet your low-carb needs and learn how to cook. You'll be better off than following the recipes in this book (or any Keto cookbook for that matter)",5 people found this helpful,0

1524,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",1,"Recipes are gross, boring & uninspiring",Format: Paperback,"The Keto diet is NOT the answer to the growing problem of obesity, diabetes and other illnesses. Many people have lived long, healthy lives and remained within a ""normal"" weight range their whole lives by eating a wide variety of healthy food (including carbs), in moderation. The problem is people overeat or eat garbage and then turn to diets like Keto as a Band-Aid ""fix"" for their problems.

I'm an experienced cook (40+ yrs) with a wide range of tastes and foods. I'm interested in learning about various ""diets"" and lately I've been interested in the Keto diet but every cookbook I look at, it's the same old - same old. Carolyn Ketchum's book is no different. The recipes are bland, boring, repetitive, uninspiring and reminiscent of recipes in the 50's and 60's where you created ""instant food"" with ingredients you threw together. Just gross. Why not cook everything from scratch using only fresh, wholesome ingredients? (Cream cheese is processed food - sorry to disappoint... and so is shredded Mozzarella with a plethora of additives!) To be fair, the Keto diet is EXTREMELY restrictive in terms of what kinds of fruits & vegetables you can eat (never mind having to omit ALL grains) so that leaves very little in terms of choices for recipe creations. That being said, exactly how much cauliflower, zucchini and broccoli can one eat before one wants to gag? Better yet, before your body gets sick of it (and may even start rejecting it by developing a sensitivity or allergy to it? This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world.

1569,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",1,"Recipes are gross, boring & uninspiring",Format: Paperback,"The Keto diet is NOT the answer to the growing problem of obesity, diabetes and other illnesses. Many people have lived long, healthy lives and remained within a ""normal"" weight range their whole lives by eating a wide variety of healthy food (including carbs), in moderation. The problem is people overeat or eat garbage and then turn to diets like Keto as a Band-Aid ""fix"" for their problems.

I'm an experienced cook (40+ yrs) with a wide range of tastes and foods. I'm interested in learning about various ""diets"" and lately I've been interested in the Keto diet but every cookbook I look at, it's the same old - same old. Carolyn Ketchum's book is no different. The recipes are bland, boring, repetitive, uninspiring and reminiscent of recipes in the 50's and 60's where you created ""instant food"" with ingredients you threw together. Just gross. Why not cook everything from scratch using only fresh, wholesome ingredients? (Cream cheese is processed food - sorry to disappoint... and so is shredded Mozzarella with a plethora of additives!) To be fair, the Keto diet is EXTREMELY restrictive in terms of what kinds of fruits & vegetables you can eat (never mind having to omit ALL grains) so that leaves very little in terms of choices for recipe creations. That being said, exactly how much cauliflower, zucchini and broccoli can one eat before one wants to gag? Better yet, before your body gets sick of it (and may even start rejecting it by developing a sensitivity or allergy to it? This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world. Each one provides something our bodies need. Balance is the key, not restrictive diets (with recipes that make you want to gag). To each his own...

Many people have lived long, healthy lives and remained within a ""normal"" weight range their whole lives by eating a wide variety of healthy food (including carbs), in moderation. The problem is people overeat or eat garbage and then turn to diets like Keto as a Band-Aid ""fix"" for their problems.

I'm an experienced cook (40+ yrs) with a wide range of tastes and foods. I'm interested in learning about various ""diets"" and lately I've been interested in the Keto diet but every cookbook I look at, it's the same old - same old. Carolyn Ketchum's book is no different. The recipes are bland, boring, repetitive, uninspiring and reminiscent of recipes in the 50's and 60's where you created ""instant food"" with ingredients you threw together. Just gross. Why not cook everything from scratch using only fresh, wholesome ingredients? (Cream cheese is processed food - sorry to disappoint... and so is shredded Mozzarella with a plethora of additives!) To be fair, the Keto diet is EXTREMELY restrictive in terms of what kinds of fruits & vegetables you can eat (never mind having to omit ALL grains) so that leaves very little in terms of choices for recipe creations. That being said, exactly how much cauliflower, zucchini and broccoli can one eat before one wants to gag? Better yet, before your body gets sick of it (and may even start rejecting it by developing a sensitivity or allergy to it? This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world. Each one provides something our bodies need. Balance is the key, not restrictive diets (with recipes that make you want to gag). To each his own...

If you're into Keto dieting, find regular recipes that you can ""adapt"" to meet your low-carb needs and learn how to cook. You'll be better off than following the recipes in this book (or any Keto cookbook for that matter)",5 people found this helpful,0

This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world. Each one provides something our bodies need. Balance is the key, not restrictive diets (with recipes that make you want to gag). To each his own...

1713,"The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen: With More than 150 Inspirational Low-Carb, High-Fat Recipes to Maximize Your Health (1)",1,"Recipes are gross, boring & uninspiring",Format: Paperback,"The Keto diet is NOT the answer to the growing problem of obesity, diabetes and other illnesses. Many people have lived long, healthy lives and remained within a ""normal"" weight range their whole lives by eating a wide variety of healthy food (including carbs), in moderation. The problem is people overeat or eat garbage and then turn to diets like Keto as a Band-Aid ""fix"" for their problems.

I'm an experienced cook (40+ yrs) with a wide range of tastes and foods. I'm interested in learning about various ""diets"" and lately I've been interested in the Keto diet but every cookbook I look at, it's the same old - same old. Carolyn Ketchum's book is no different. The recipes are bland, boring, repetitive, uninspiring and reminiscent of recipes in the 50's and 60's where you created ""instant food"" with ingredients you threw together. Just gross. Why not cook everything from scratch using only fresh, wholesome ingredients? (Cream cheese is processed food - sorry to disappoint... and so is shredded Mozzarella with a plethora of additives!) To be fair, the Keto diet is EXTREMELY restrictive in terms of what kinds of fruits & vegetables you can eat (never mind having to omit ALL grains) so that leaves very little in terms of choices for recipe creations. That being said, exactly how much cauliflower, zucchini and broccoli can one eat before one wants to gag? Better yet, before your body gets sick of it (and may even start rejecting it by developing a sensitivity or allergy to it? This is a well-known fact, anything you eat TOO much of becomes a target) The body needs a variety of nutrients (minerals, vitamins, etc..) that cannot be obtained by eating a small subset of foods. Hence why each and every fruit and vegetable provides a little of everything you need if you eat small amounts and rotate them seasonally.

I understand and respect the fact that this diet and lifestyle may work for some people but I find that the recipes have been ""Keto-i-fied"" to the point where they become gross. It would make more sense to find regular recipes and simply modify them slightly to remove (or lower) the high-carb elements instead of ""Frankensteining"" recipes to the point where they are unrecognizable. Cauliflower rice does NOT taste like real rice and Zucchini noodles do NOT taste like pasta no matter how much sauce I put on them. Swerve in any dessert tastes gross and I've tried every ""sugar-free"" sweetener on the market in my baking, all of which have failed miserably (much to the chagrin of my taste buds and wallet!)

It would make more sense if people simply learned how to cook real food using fresh ingredients and ate in moderation. Who knows what the long-term cumulative effects of eating a high fat/low carb diet will have on people's bodies. You won't know until it's too late. I shudder at the thought of what all that fat is doing to my arteries & heart. There's a reason why there's an abundance of natural fruits and vegetables in the world.
