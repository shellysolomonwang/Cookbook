0,Vegan on the Cheap,4,"So far, so yummy!",Format: Paperback,"I really like this cookbook so far. I'm not vegan (though I am working on eating mostly vegan meals) and the couple that we've tried so far have been enjoyed by even my picky 9 year old (though, I will say, I did leave out the extra toppings on his burritos because I didn't feel like a battle!). I really enjoy the extra information in the book that encourages you to be frugal and not to obsess over organics if you can't afford them - just to do YOUR best. Whatever is possible for YOUR budget (I WISH I could afford organics, but on one income we can't. I'm learning how to garden, but it's a slow process!)

There are NO PICTURES in this book, which might be a downer for some, but I think it makes the book more affordable, which is a plus for those of us who just want some easy, cheap, healthy vegan recipes.

Most of the recipes in here use simple, whole foods - which are the healthiest AND cheapest. There are recipes on how to make your own vegan ""meats"" (the wheatballs were surprisingly good - and no, you can't see or taste the mushrooms which is great, because my kids hates vegetables - and I'm not a fan of 'shrooms either) that call for gluten flour. But all in all, it seems gluten flour and nutritional yeast are about as fancy as this book gets. It's very do-able.

I think a lot of the recipes probably take more time if you cook it all from scratch. Something easy, like spaghetti a ""wheat""balls becomes somewhat of a process when making the wheatballs from scratch and the sauce from scratch, but you can of course always batch cook and freeze, or use store bought sauce instead of DIY.

I say buy it. Robin is a great chef, and it will save you money even if you just use 1 or 2 of the ""cheap"" recipes each week.",7 people found this helpful,1
11,Vegan on the Cheap,4,Staples & Basics,Format: Paperback,"This is an excellent source for a ""from scratch"" vegan. It really is cheaper to make a lot of those vegan products you'd find at place like Whole Foods and Sprouts. I've been making seitan but the recipes in this book really simplifies the process. Because of this book I am saving a lot of money on fake meats, vegan mayo, and produce that often goes bad before I use it. So far the recipes are all tasty and pretty simple to make. They are time consuming but if you do a lot of the prep work ahead of time it goes a bit quicker. I try to cut up veggies and freeze them for the day. I make a bunch of seitan on Sunday for my boyfriend to slice and make sandwiches with. It also has some slow cooker recipes that are awesome. I set up my crock pot with a timer so it cooks while we're at work. We both get to come home to a hearty hot supper with minimal clean up. Best of all, our grocery bill went from $300/week to $65 - $75/week.
I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't have access to the fancy ""health food"" stores or anyone that doesn't want to spend like mad just to have a hearty sandwich. It's also great for new vegans learning to cook.",16 people found this helpful,1
12,Vegan on the Cheap,5,Yummy recipes,Format: Paperback,"I cooked my way through this cook ok while living abroad for a year in a country with sketchy meat standards. The recipes are easy, cheap, and taste great. I did have to substitute some things but it was never too hard to do so. I like how the author breaks down the pricing and gives you alternatives if you want to splurge on a recipe.",7 people found this helpful,1
13,Vegan on the Cheap,5,Even just the basics are enough to justify buying this book!,Format: Kindle Edition,"I haven't tried a great deal of the recipes. The ones I have made, I've liked a great deal. But, the ones that are the staple recipes--- wow-- those are worth the 10 dollar purchase price alone. I've probably saved at least that much with the Faux Parm recipe and the Peanut Sauce. And, believe it or not, I've probably saved at least twice that since I learned in here how simple it is to make veggie broth. I was spending about $15 a week on that and thinking I had no time to do it at home. This book convinced me to try it at home.

I make a batch on Sunday night while I am watching tv, freeze it and use it throughout the week. Amazing how much better my food is and how much lower my grocery bill. And it takes hardly any time!

I also bought the same author's 1,000 Vegan Recipes and it's excellent, too! (It might be 1,001-- I forget!)

Update--10/28/2016

I go back and forth eating plant based. but this book remains one of my favorite of all time cookbooks because it is so very money saving and the food is so good. I love the Peanutty Pumpkin Stew, the Cincinnati Suburb Chili, and the White Beans and Lemon Potatoes with Olives and Potatoes are yummy too (think I will make the latter for dinner tonight!).",7 people found this helpful,1
14,Vegan on the Cheap,5,Comforting vegan food...,Format: Paperback,"I love this book. The recipes are wonderful for anyone transitioning to a vegan diet or even for anyone vegan or not vegan! I've made so many recipes from this book for my whole family, including meat eaters-- and they *loved* them. Any time I make something from here there are no leftovers. People eat it all until it's gone. There are plenty of comfort food recipes in here that leave people feeling satisfied. The desserts are amazing and simple! My favorite dishes to make for people are the Vegetable Cobbler (which I sub the seasonings with just one-- savory seasoning!), Tortilla Strata, Sunday Supper Frittata (which I have also modified to make a fabulous vegan quiche!), Samosa Pie, and the quickest one ever-- Barbecued Black Bean and Tofu Burritos.. all so full of flavor. My family's favorite desserts are the Chocolate Blueberry Crumble (yum!) and the no bake Chocolate Peanut Butter Oatmeal Cookies.. very addicting!
You will find lots of staple recipes that are easy to make again and again. There is also a recipe for making your own seitan, since it can get expensive. Usually any seitan recipe I sub with tofu anyway, but it is good to know how to make your own seitan if you prefer something ""meatier"".
This book can make becoming vegan seem effortless-- and it does save you money! The recipes are broken down into cost per serving, there are money saving tips as well as menu planning. I love the ""Splurge a little"" notes with each recipe to add a little extra flair to each dish if you feel like splurging a little:).
*A little side note.. there is a make your own mayo recipe in here, however the best vegan mayo recipe ever can be found in Vegan Fusion (A more advanced vegan recipe book.. but also amazing)!",7 people found this helpful,1
15,Vegan on the Cheap,5,staple in my kitchen,Format: Paperback,"We use this book several times a week. It is simple, and good food. Really enjoyed some things I didn't think I would even try making- the Mayo recipe for sandwich spreads is great. The Tofu-feta is a favorite around here (we top the Lemon Garlic Patties with it- my husbands most requested meal). So many good meals from the recipes, and it has inspired many others through the techniques learned. Our ""Top Pick"" recipe from the book was the Spinach and Orange with Walnut Crusted Tofu... we actually made it for Thanksgiving and our non-veg guests were quite impressed with it!",7 people found this helpful,1
16,Vegan on the Cheap,5,"Save money, make your own fake meat!",Format: Paperback,"The first time I made Baked Seitan Loaf, I got my money's worth. My kids love to eat those meatless luncheon meat slices, such as Tofurkey brand Hickory Smoked Deli Slices. An 11 oz package usually costs around $4. The baked Seitan Loaf makes 2 pounds and the kids love it as much as the store bought slices.

Everything I made from this cookbook has turned out delicious: Black and White Bean Chili, Pasta e Fagioli, Slow Cooker Seitan Pot Roast, Chocolate cupcakes with Peanut Butter Frosting, Spaghetti Marinara with Wheatballs, Better-than-Takeout Tofu Stir-Fry, Tofu Fried Rice, Comfort Loaf. It is nice to have a cookbook that allows me to follow a recipe with the confidence that my family will enjoy the results of my labor.",11 people found this helpful,1
17,Vegan on the Cheap,5,My go to vegan cookbook!!,Format: Paperback,"This by far is one of my favorite go to vegan cookbooks. The recipes are very simple and easy to understand. They all take about 30 minutes or less to put together (which I love), and thus far, everything I've made as been absolutely delicious! The vegan pizza was a HUGE hit in my home and who knew that the ""cheezee sauce"" (on page 36) would be so yummy!! Most of these recipes you make already have the ingredients you have in your home right now, so there's no need to go to the store searching for a bunch of ""fancy"" items you'll only use once; no these recipes are for the novice (and hungry) at heart who just want to eat some good vegan food! Great book for anyone thinking of going vegan or great for the new vegan.",23 people found this helpful,1
18,Vegan on the Cheap,5,Most Used Cookbook on Our Shelves,Format: Paperback,"My boyfriend and I purchased this book last fall based on the many positive reviews and beautiful user photos on Amazon. It was a couple of weeks before we started using it, but it wasn't long after that that it became our all-time favorite cookbook. The recipes really are inexpensive, but more importantly than that they're delicious enough that you'll want to make them over and over again, regardless of the low cost.

One thing that really sets this book apart from other vegan and vegetarian cookbooks on my shelf is the lack of inconvenient ingredients. The fact that I can open my tiny pantry and find most of the ingredients needed for many of the recipes is a definite factor in the cheap equation, but is also what has me using this book more than any other. I can't tell you how many times I've flipped through some of my other popular cookbooks, landed on recipes that sounded absolutely fabulous, but then decided not to make them because the list of things I'd need to buy was too long.

Another great thing about this book is the inclusion of many one pot/dish meals. I love that so many of the recipes can be served up on their own or with a simple salad as a complete meal.

Despite the relative simplicity of the ingredient lists and the ability to often throw everything together into a single pan, with very little exception (see below for details), every single thing we've made from this book has been very good. These recipes really are formulated to get the best out of everyday, inexpensive ingredients. Furthermore, the fact that there are very few ""convenience foods"" used makes both cooking and eating these recipes very satisfying.

On the topic of convenience foods, another wonderful thing about this book is that it teaches you to make many of your own. There are recipes for everything from salsa, to seitan, to beans from scratch (which are way cheaper than canned, and if done right, can be just as convenient) -- and everything in between -- often times with instructions for freezing them so you can have them on hand for later. Anyone who's ever scoffed at the price of some of these things in the store will certainly appreciate this section of the book.

So far, our favorite recipes from this book (though it's honestly hard to narrow it down) have been Three-Bean Loaf (which we make every time we accumulate three containers of different beans in our freezer), Penny Pinching Picadillo, Skillet Hash (made with leftover slow cooker Seitan Pot Roast), and Barbecued Black Bean and Tofu Burritos (which we always double or triple for great leftovers). The only recipes we've made that weren't absolutely wonderful were the Corned Seitan and the Smoky Red Bean Chili with Chipotle-Cornbread Dumplings. The corned seitan calls for a topping of pickling spices, and based on a photo of this dish taken by the author I have a feeling that our brand of pickling spices was not the same as her's. It lent some odd flavorings to the dish. As for the chili -- our dumplings came out as more of a topping which became mushy and wasn't very flavorful. The chili itself was very good though and we would be likely to make it again some day without the dumplings.

This book is truly amazing, and I can't recommend it enough. The recipes are both cheap and delicious, and most of them can be made with very basic ingredients.",26 people found this helpful,1
19,Vegan on the Cheap,5,First ever vegan cookbook!,Format: Paperback,"This was my first ever vegan cookbook and I fell in love with Robin Robertson's style of cooking here. I've since bought several of her other books but I don't like them as much and therefore do not use them as much. Many of her recipes are extremely similar from book to book with the exception of one or two ingredients but anyhow, this book itself is a winner for me. We aren't full time vegans so any recipe that calls for fake cheese makes me queezy and I use the real thing instead. There is a minor editing error in the chocolate surprise brownies (awesome, btw) in that it doesn't say when to add the cocoa powder in the instructions but it is listed as an ingredient. Most everything I have made from here is top notch and this book is worth the buy.",2 people found this helpful,1
20,Vegan on the Cheap,5,Delicious and Nutritious!,Format: Kindle Edition,"This is a wonderful cookbook. I am not strictly vegan, but I like to cook vegan a lot of the time, for health and budgetary reasons. This cookbook is just what I've been looking for to help me expand my vegan vocabulary in the kitchen (and better stick to my grocery budget)!

I love that these recipes are based on whole foods ingredients and are not overly-reliant on soy products; I really dislike vegan cookbooks that just try to recreate meat-based recipes with soy - not my thing. So far, I have made a number of the soups in the cookbook and they have turned out wonderfully - extremely flavorful, but also low-fat and chock full o' veggies. I'm looking forward to making more.

My one complaint about the book would be that I would like to see nutritional information alongside the recipes; just think that would be healthy.

For Kindle users: the layout of this cookbook in the Kindle is great. I have some other cookbooks on my Kindle that have awkward design flaws, but this reads really nicely in e-book format.",10 people found this helpful,1

172,Vegan on the Cheap,4,"Great cookbook, with one caveat",Format: Paperback,"The recipes in this book really are inexpensive to make. The book starts with about 28 pages of advice on ways to save money on food, and the rest of the book is devoted to recipes. I have tried the following so far, and thought they were great:

Cheezee sauce (excellent!)
Comfort loaf (Best vegan 'meatloaf' I've ever had)
Baked ziti (Delicious; I was amazed at how well the tofu worked in this dish)
Mexican rice and bean bake (Today's dinner - also outstanding)

The one caveat I have about the book is that some of the directions appear to be incomplete. This is okay for experienced cooks that can just figure out how to make it work. But someone with less experience and know-how could possibly end up wasting money by trying recipes that won't work.

For example, the Cheezee sauce recipe tells you to combine some ingredients in a saucepan. Then it says, ""Turn the heat on medium and whisk in the soy milk. Cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens, about 1 minute."" This makes it sound like you are supposed to just turn on the heat and have the pot on the stove for 1 minute. What you have to do is bring the mixture to boiling and then cook it for about 1 minute longer. So, the author forgot to mention the part about bringing the mixture to boiling. If you've never made a sauce this way before, you might throw it out if you follow the directions, because it's not useful in that watery state.

In the Mexican rice and bean bake, the recipe involves partially cooking some rice on the stovetop, and then putting it in the oven to cook the rest of the way. I think that there is something missing from the directions there as well, because I cooked and baked as directed, and had to double my baking time to cook the rice completely. (And, no, there is nothing wrong with my oven.) I presume that it was supposed to be cooked a little longer on the stovetop first, but again, the directions just indicated that you were to return the stovetop mixture to boiling, and then dump it in the pan to go into the oven. I suspect you were supposed to boil it for a little while on the stovetop first.

The food tastes great. She really does a lot with inexpensive ingredients. (One of the things I liked about this cookbook was that she only asks you to have a few non-standard ingredients on hand, unlike most vegan cookbooks, which expect that you are secretly running an international grocery store in your kitchen.) But considering I tried 4 recipes so far, and 2 of them had inaccurate directions, I'm a little concerned about the rest of the book. I'll just have to remember to be more vigilant when making these recipes.

I think this is particularly important for this book, because I am sure that this book was geared, in part, to the 'starving students' and other new vegans who want to eat vegan on a budget. In general, younger people have less cooking experience and therefore will be less likely to know how to 'fix' these recipes. Also, I have a few of Robertson's other cookbooks, and haven't ever come across this problem so far. So, I'm disappointed for that reason, too.

But, man, that Mexican rice and bean bake is REALLY good.",452 people found this helpful,1

Not only are the recipes interesting and delicious (ex: Easy Peanut Sauce, how could I have presented Thai curry without this before?), but the book also has unique elements that I've never seen before. For example, each recipe comes with an estimated cost per serving. Wow.

There is a ""Cheap Trick"" section that explains how to have vegan versions of staples like Parmesan and bread crumbs, which can be pricey if you buy them prepackaged. The vegan Parmesan ""cheese"" recipe uses nuts and nutritional yeast that makes a rich topping that helps me turn my old vegan standards into restaurant-style dishes. The book also has a helpful section on where to find high quality ingredients at low cost. It also gives a suggested shopping list! this is really exciting to me as I'm hopeless with figuring out what I need to buy and end up just buying whatever catches my eye at the store. I also like the suggested menu for a week.

I highly recommend this excellent cookbook for people who are vegan or for omnivores who just want to eat more healthy, vegan food. It has a nice cover and the inside style is clean and sleek, so I'd also recommend giving it as a gift either to someone who is vegan or just trying have a healthier diet without sacrificing taste, time or money.",104 people found this helpful,1
193,Vegan on the Cheap,5,The most used and appreciated cookbook I own,Format: Paperback,"Robin Robertson has done it again! This cookbook introduced me to Cutlets on the Cheap and they are the most versatile and loved-by-all main dish in my household. I do not miss meat nor do I feel the need to mimic it, but I think the best way to describe the cutlets for the purpose of this review, would be to compare them to chicken. I bread and fry or bake like some people would chicken breasts. They are delicious with mashed cauliflower/potatoes and gravy, as a sandwich, cut into strips, made like chicken parm, etc. They're amazing. In fact, most of the recipes in this book make delicious meals. Practical, inexpensive, easy to prepare, readily available ingredients, and family favorites.

194,Vegan on the Cheap,5,Wonderful first vegan book!,Format: Paperback,"I only decided to go vegan about a month ago, and at first I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to find a bunch of recipes that I liked AND that were inexpensive to prepare. On a whim, I did an Amazon search for ""vegan"" and ""cheap,"" and I came across this book. I bought it instantly. There are so many great recipes in here, and the most expensive one costs $2/serving. That's amazing, and the only ingredient that I had issue finding at first was nutritional yeast, which I've since found is a vegan staple.

So far, these are the recipes I've tried:
BLACK AND WHITE BEAN CHILI - Hands down my favorite recipe in this book. I'll never need another chili recipe again.

BAKED ZITI - Delicious! The tofu worked wonderfully.

FAUX PARMESAN - My savior. I put parmesan cheese on everything, and I couldn't imagine going vegan without having this wonderful alternative!

RADIATORE ESCAROLE WITH WHITE BEANS - I haven't tried escarole yet, but I tried this dish with kale, and it was great. Very easy to make, and it only requires a handful of ingredients.

PIZZA DOUGH - Who knew you could make a great dough with only three ingredients? I haven't tried the pizzas listed yet, but I used the dough recipe to make my own, and it was great!

BETTER BEAN BURGERS - So easy to make, and yet so delicious! I am definitely turning to these the next time I feel a craving for burgers!

ASIAN PEANUT PASTA SALAD - The first recipe I tried, and an absolute winner.

These were just the ones I could think of off the top of my head. I look forward to trying them all. I highly recommend this book to anyone who's looking to cook delicious, cheap vegan food!",10 people found this helpful,1
195,Vegan on the Cheap,5,Great cookbook for the wallet and the tastebuds :),Format: Paperback,"I love this cookbook. I typically go on cookbook binges (one or two cookbooks for most of my needs for several months at a time) and this one hasn't disappointed a bit. The recipes are fantastic and fit many different needs (one of my friends is allergic to soy and another is trying paleo for awhile--practically the opposite of vegan, but that doesn't mean impossible, and the vegetable crisp totally fit both of our bills). The recipes are fantastic and have gotten me to start to make a lot of basic things at home that I never had really considered before such as marinara sauce, bread, and vegetable broth. Some of my favorite recipes have been: Caldo Verde, Better-Than-Takeout Tofu Stir-fry, Sunday Supper Frittata,Smoky SW Sweet Potato Shepard's Pie, Tempeh Bobotee and the aforementioned Vegetable Crisp. ...Basically I've loved everything I've made :P Did I mention it definitely has saved me money?

Only caveat I had was that there are no pictures (I'm a sucker for pictures). But I have a theory that the lack of pictures kept production costs down, thus making the book itself cheap(ish) :)

196,Vegan on the Cheap,5,I've made six recipes from the book just today...,Format: Paperback,"I received this book as a gift and decided to try the week of menus listed at the beginning just to get a good feel for what it's like. For dinner, I made Pasta Slaw and Better Bean Burgers. With the slaw, I ended up mixing a little bit of vegan mayo into the dressing, and with the bean burgers, I added a touch of curry (the recipe mentions adding various spices to change the flavor). Both were delicious. The bean burgers were some of the best, easiest burgers I've ever made, and the slaw was crunch and sweet - and I usually hate slaw! I decided to get a jump on the next day's menu, so I made the House Dressing recipe and Pasta E Fagioli. I made the soup exactly as directed, save for adding 1/2 a medium onion, 2 large carrots, and a celery stalk. For the dressing, I used only 1/4 cup olive oil, and substituted vegan mayo for the rest. Also, I added oregano instead of basil. What I ended up with was something that tastes similar to a Greek dressing, but better than any Greek dressing I've ever encountered! I also made the pie crust dough for the Samosa Pie and, because I couldn't resist, I made Cheapamole. I liked the flavor a lot, but I ended up adding an avocado, and stirring in diced tomatoes. Best guac I've ever had. Everything I've made so far has come out wonderfully. I've changed them only to suit my personal taste, not to fix anything that is wrong - they are great as-is. I highly recommend.",4 people found this helpful,1
