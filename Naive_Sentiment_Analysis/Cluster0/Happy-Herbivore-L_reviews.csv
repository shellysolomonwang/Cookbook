1,Happy Herbivore Light & Lean: Over 150 Low-Calorie Recipes with Workout Plans for Looking and Feeling Great,5,Loving Light and Lean!!,Format: Paperback,"I have all of Happy Herbivore's cookbooks, but this may be my favorite! Like all of Lindsay's cookbooks, this is a plant based, no oil, low fat, quick-meals cookbook. The twist with this one is that it's geared to folks who might want to lose weight or achieve certain calorie targets, although the food is healthy and delicious even if you aren't. All of the meals are ginormous and filling and low calorie, even more so than her other books, which still had a lot of lean in them!

Things I love in general about this book:
* Lindsay has a very positive, relatable writing style. It's like talking to a friend.
* The look of the book is very bright and clean, with great graphics and color and tons of high quality photos. It is a very pretty cookbook.
* All the recipes have calorie counts, nutritional details, and WW points if you need them.
* I LOVE LOVE LOVE the part at the beginning where she lists which recipes are in certain calorie ranges. You can see this on the Amazon preview. It is nice because you can do your own meal planning! If you know you want a certain calorie target, you can pick things from each category to make your meal plans.
* I love the recipe categories: breakfasts, baked goods, bowls and wraps (great section!), soups/stews, pastas, burgers, sandwiches/tacos, snacks, and desserts.
* New snack category is awesome! I can't wait to tuck into these recipes. For appetizers, this is perfect.
* I love the drink section. Some warm drinks, some cool, some cocktails. It's a nice touch from HHA and I hope it continues.
* The Lean section is a great touch. The exercises are well thought out and photographed, and provide inspiration and several great ideas for how to incorporate exercise into your daily life. I'm glad the Lean section is there, but am also glad it's not as big as the recipe section! 
* Lindsay has recipes to use up ingredients you may have had to purchase for other recipes. For example, she has at least four (maybe more) recipes with canned pumpkin, so you won't be left with a cup of random pumpkin and no idea what to do with it. And she often calls out where you could use the leftovers, like with the Skinny Puttanesca and Skinny Cheater Pad Thai which both use spaghetti squash.
* I love the pictures of Lindsay hiking and snowboarding at the beginning and end of the book. It's inspiring. I felt like, ""I want to go there, too! It's an adventure.""

My only not-serious complaint is that Lindsay is so prolific with her writing that I can't keep up. I'm still trying new things from ""Happy Herbivore Abroad""!

The first recipe I made after the cookbook arrived was a cocktail. The ""Dublin"" was awesome! Very fast and easy, with a super delicious chocolate/coffee flavor. Yummy. I know there are some comments on the alcohol drinks, but there are FOUR alcohol drinks in the cookbook and one is a super light spritzer with only a ¼ cup of wine in the whole thing. I know some people don't imbibe, but it's easy enough to just skip those four recipes if that's you. It's not like the book is a booze-fest. I appreciate the practical aspect of being provided with some low calorie, delicious cocktails because many people drink, and most doctors, including our whole foods, plant based doctors, support moderate alcohol intake.

Something else that I know is important to many people is that there are no faux meats or cheeses in the book. Several recipes for DIY cheeses are included (Nacho Cheese, Cheese Ball!!, Cheese Spread, Parmesan), but nothing pre-made. I personally don't mind using the occasional amount of faux meat/cheese but it takes a lot more skill to craft recipes that don't rely on ready made things like that. Lindsay is also mindful of dietary needs. There are many soy-free and gluten-free recipes, and she always offers suggestions for modifications to make other recipes soy or gluten free. She uses beans and lentils much more than tofu, tempeh, and seitan/gluten; while I love all the veggie foods, I know beans are the best for filling me up! So I like that fiber punch.

Other recipes I have made (besides the awesome Dublin):
* Spinach Love Wrap: Refreshing and unusual - super filling and so low in calories you can eat two huge wraps!
* Pumpkin Pancakes: Amazing and easy. Very fluffy and delicious.
* Oatmeal 300: I LOVE this section. Lindsay gives a bunch of options for jazzing up oatmeal and they are all delicious combos and many rely on a banana or applesauce as a sweetener.
* Breakfast Tacos: Incredible idea, and SO FILLING! I was full until 1pm after having two of these for breakfast. Perfect morning meal.
* Pumpkin Chili: Super hearty and filling. Definitely try this one! It's unusual and delicious.
* Deviled ""Eggs"": Game changer!! So simple and tasty and CUTE. Everyone will love these. They aren't weird, even my omni family loved these!
* Everyday Mushroom Gravy: Awesome sauce! Literally. This is a perfect mushroom gravy for potatoes and anything else.
* Caribbean Bowl: Delicious and fresh combo. Comes together so quickly, but great flavors! I've had it as a wrap and a bowl. Great both ways.
* Lentil and Pear Salad: Another simple but awesome combo! I like it with raspberry vinaigrette. Beautiful and filling.
* Lentil Joes: Who doesn't love a Joe?? Fiber filled, low calorie, fast, delicious. The whole family loved these and the sauce is delicious.

Other recipes that are in my queue to try are: Pineapple Pancakes, Ruby Chocolate Muffins, Skinny Mac and Cheese (on tonight's menu!), Nacho Bowl, Irish Stew, Spinach Artichoke Dip, Tofu Jerky!!, Sangria Spritzer, Molasses Cake, Dark Chocolate Truffles, Pizza Burgers, Lentil-Oat Burgers, Taco Burgers, Thai Tacos, Lemon Zucchini Muffins, Pink Lemonade, Olive Gravy, Smoky Apple Baked Beans, Microwave Peach Cobbler, Ginger Cabbage Stir Fry, Autumn Salad with Maple Dressing, Barbeque Wrap, Sonoma Chicken Salad....basically the whole book. 

My favorite thing about Lindsay's recipes is that they are all things you can imagine yourself coming up with, if you had the time. I've read comments in reviews of her other cookbooks that the recipes are so simple you could have thought of them yourself and I always want to say, ""Yeah, but you didn't. That's the point."" I COULD think of six different burgers and test the wet to dry ratios and try a bunch of flavors and think of toppings and calculate the nutrition and take a cute photo of my creation but thing with Happy Herbivore recipes, is - I DON'T HAVE TO. Lindsay comes up with recipes using things that you have in your pantry, combines them in yummy and unusual (but not crazy!) ways, and figures out the nutritional info for you. Since most of us have to work and can't spend as much time as we'd like in the kitchen, let Lindsay help you. Lindsay's Happy Herbivore recipes are my go-to weekday meals and it's not because I CAN'T cook without help. It's because I LIKE HELP on weeknights. I can create and make seitan roasts, home-made ravioli and triple layer cakes on the weekends. Lindsay is always there for me when I need a fast, delicious, healthy meal, and I'm very grateful for that.

2,Happy Herbivore Light & Lean: Over 150 Low-Calorie Recipes with Workout Plans for Looking and Feeling Great,5,WFPB - food as medicine,Format: Paperback,"Half these recipes don't need recipes. Written by a lawyer not a chef. I would say I could have written it since I'm a foodie lawyer with personal chef experience - but I didn't write the book. I will say that the Happy Herbivore meal plans are AMAZING!!!!! Sure, buy the books because they're cheap & your dollars support veganism & thus non exploitation of animals & personal longevity. And it's nice sometimes to have a physical recipe book. But, more importantly ... subscribe to the annual meal plans put out by the author. They will help you lose weight, get fit, save tons of time & money & are good for the earth & her precious critters. I do enjoy flipping through this & occasionally make something but the meal plan recipes are better. Also my meat eating husband won't even try any of these recipes. If you partake in the Standard American Diet & enjoy grease, animal products & processed foods, you'll probably freak out a little because this is whole foods plant based & just about as healthy as you can get, food as medicine. Very not what Americans are accustomed to. My husband refuses to eat vegetables, and when I showed him the book he basically asked why I hate him so much. Once he commented that something from the meal plans smelled good but when he saw it was oil free & vegan, he shriveled into a pile of grey mass on the kitchen floor. If you're sick & tired of being sick & tired & you're looking for a new way of eating that will make you trim, happy & glowing, look no further. Bite the bullet & do what's right. It's not easy but neither is being fat & sick. If you're not ready, progress not perfection!!! Also - no exotic ingredients here.",16 people found this helpful,1
3,Happy Herbivore Light & Lean: Over 150 Low-Calorie Recipes with Workout Plans for Looking and Feeling Great,5,Just what I was looking for,Format: Paperback,"I love this cookbook! I have been vegetarian for 24+ years and have recently been cooking more vegan at home. I have a number of vegan cookbooks (including Happy Herbivore Abroad) but I also wanted low calorie recipes as I'm trying to lose a few pounds. This cookbook has been great so far. My favorite recipes have been the pumpkin chili (pg 118), the lentil marinara sauce (pg 155), and the meatloaf bites (pg 79). I didn't love the skinny mac 'n' cheese but I think I just need to add more hot sauce because the pumpkin made it a little sweet for me. I'll definitely try it again though. I have made some of her do-it-yourself items as well and they are easy and it is nice to have homemade sauces and staples.

So if you are vegan or exploring more vegan cooking AND looking for low calorie options, I highly recommend this book. Enjoy!",4 people found this helpful,1
4,Happy Herbivore Light & Lean: Over 150 Low-Calorie Recipes with Workout Plans for Looking and Feeling Great,5,Little to add but a big thanks to LIndsay Nixon (and John McDougall for introducing me to her),Format: Paperback,"I get the free monthly newsletter from Dr. John and Mary McDougall (www_drmcdougall_com). This month featured recipes from this cookbook. This was the first I'd heard of Lindsay Nixon (yeah, where have I been?!). The recipes looked good so I tried the homemade mayonnaise and the Thai taco recipes. They were first-rate. I've cooked enough that I usually can tell just from looking at a recipe if it will taste good and if the recipe writer as that ""it"" factor that makes for creative dishes with a twist or extra punch, not just the boring same old stuff. So, I ordered this book from Amazon and got it today. It is beautiful! Loads of nice photos, well-organized layout with color-coded keys for calorie counts and icons for other key nutrition categories. The other recipes are enticing and I can't wait to try them. I will probably plow through this book quickly and then come back for her other 3. This book addresses a welcome niche in the vegan genre--believe it or not, there are obese vegans. This book implements the health principles advocated by John McDougall, Caldwell Esselstyn, T. Colin Campbell and others, but with the creative and tasteful flair that makes that way of eating more generally appealing. Lindsay Nixon has done humanity and the earth a big favor. Do yourself one by buying and using this book.",14 people found this helpful,1
5,Happy Herbivore Light & Lean: Over 150 Low-Calorie Recipes with Workout Plans for Looking and Feeling Great,5,"Quick, simple, and tasty recipes",Format: Paperback,"This is my first HH cookbook, and I waited to read reviews before ordering it since I wasn't sure whether or not I really ""needed"" it. Based on the positive reviews, I purchased it -- and I'm really glad I did!

Unlike other vegan cookbooks (I'm looking at you, Kris Carr!), this one uses everyday ingredients that you can find at your local supermarket. You don't need to order or go on the hunt for any special ingredients.

As other reviewers have noted, many of the recipes are very basic and simple, but I have enjoyed making them since it's encouraged me to put ingredients and flavors together in new ways I wouldn't have thought of myself.

I also like how the recipes are all quick to make, so that they can come together on a weeknight when you get home later and are too tired to cook something fancier. (Or is that just my laziness?! :-) )

Great cookbook, and I know I'll be buying more from Lindsay Nixon!",9 people found this helpful,1
6,Happy Herbivore Light & Lean: Over 150 Low-Calorie Recipes with Workout Plans for Looking and Feeling Great,4,Worth it!,Format: Paperback,"I use the recipes from this book a lot. If I were a single woman or married without children, I would probably use it every day, but feeding a family of four with these recipes isn't practical. I use it mostly when making small meals for myself when my kids are in school or making side dishes for dinner. Some of my favorites are the oven fries (super easy), classic cornbread, loaded baked potato and whole wheat biscuits. There were a few flops, of course, (quick gravy, skinny mac n' cheese, lentil & pear salad -yuck) but everyone's tastes are different. I would say that anyone would find something in this book that would make it worth owning. I'm very glad to have it and I'm looking forward to reading more of the author's books!",5 people found this helpful,1
7,Happy Herbivore Light & Lean: Over 150 Low-Calorie Recipes with Workout Plans for Looking and Feeling Great,5,Delicious and so very easy!,Format: Paperback,"I love the Happy Herbivore cookbooks and Lindsay Nixon's recipes have become family favorites. They are tasty and quick to prepare, and unlike many vegan cookbooks the ingredients are easy to find in most supermarkets.

I've had this cookbook just a few days and the recipes we've tried so far have all been delicious:

Pumpkin Pancakes - a hit even with my 10 year old who doesn't think she likes pumpkin
Tofu Scramble - my husband doesn't really like tofu but he loves this!
Chocolate Chip Muffins - easy and very yummy
Taco Burgers - delicious! If you don't have taco seasoning on hand, use chili powder blend instead
Italian Bowl - easy, tasty and filling
Thai Green Curry - fast, healthy and delicious

I have been following a plant-based, whole foods vegan diet like the one Lindsay advocates for almost two years and in that time I have lost twenty pounds effortlessly and kept it off, reversed some minor health conditions and feel more energetic than ever. I'm not sure if I would have been able to do this without the Happy Herbivore cookbooks. Although I have other similar cookbooks and have found many no-oil vegan recipes online, the recipes have not been as reliable and delicious as Lindsay's. I'm sure this book is going to be very well used in our house!",4 people found this helpful,1
8,Happy Herbivore Light & Lean: Over 150 Low-Calorie Recipes with Workout Plans for Looking and Feeling Great,5,Her best book yet!,Format: Paperback,"This is my favorite Happy Herbivore cookbook so far! I have all four of Lindsay's cookbooks and they are all amazing, but every recipe I've tried in this cookbook has been so flavorful, filling, and just simply amazing! Before I bought the first Happy Herbivore cookbook, I didn't even know how to cook and I was clueless about everything in the kitchen. I've learned how to cook so well just by following her recipes and I love how she includes ""kitchen prep lingo"" and the ""glossary of ingredients"" which explains what the ingredients are and where to find them. The pictures are beautiful and it looks like she put a lot of effort and time into it. I encourage everyone to buy this book and try cooking the recipes, even if you've never cooked before. One thing that stands out with all of Lindsay's books is that the ingredients are easy to find, affordable, and most of the meals are ready in 30 minutes or less. Without her books, I would be lost and would have given up on my plant based lifestyle a long time ago. Oh, and the Caribbean chili is amazing... even my omnivore husband practically licked the bowl clean! Thanks Lindsay for creating such wonderful recipes!

Update 12/13/13: Every recipe I have tried from this book has been impressive and beyond amazing, which includes: Ruby chocolate muffins, eggnog, lentil joes, Caribbean chili, pumpkin pancakes, pumpkin pie oatmeal, apple pie oatmeal, cherry vanilla oatmeal, chipotle harvest chili, Cajun corn chowder, thai crunch, and the burrito bowl!! Seriously... BUY THIS BOOK! :)",4 people found this helpful,1
9,Happy Herbivore Light & Lean: Over 150 Low-Calorie Recipes with Workout Plans for Looking and Feeling Great,5,Another great cook book from Lindsay,Format: Paperback,"Lindsay's recipes have been a part of my family's life almost on a daily basis since the release of her first Happy Herbivore cookbook. I have only had this cookbook for a few days but have tried 3 recipes and they are keepers. The Meatloaf Bites, Asian Crunch and the Thai stir fry. I always figure if I get one really good recipe from a cookbook it was worth its price so I'm ahead of the game already. I'm planning on making the Chocolate Cake with the sweet potato based frosting this week.....yum.........

As with the past books, this is a plant-based book with focus on real, whole food. Not processed faux food. It's easy to eat healthy with these cookbooks and the large array of recipes.

I just made the chocolate cake and chocolate sweet potato frosting. Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",7 people found this helpful,1
10,Happy Herbivore Light & Lean: Over 150 Low-Calorie Recipes with Workout Plans for Looking and Feeling Great,5,Favorite Recipe Book!,Format: Paperback,"I have about 30 vegan recipe books on my shelves now. Most have been great. As a new vegan it was nice to have the books that showed me how to make vegan food that was like what I used to eat before I was vegan. It was also nice to have all those pre-packaged faux meats and cheeses too. But they gave me gas. As I evolved as a vegan I wanted to eat like a vegan should eat and leave out oils and processed food. So I bought this book. The recipes are all low-cal and low fat, easy to make and the ingredients are cheap and easy to find. It has everything you could want to make cheap, easy and healthy food that you can feel good eating. The one thing it's not great for is desserts. If you want a healthy dessert than just eat fruit. Her recipes replace the fat you would put in with sugar. For a good dessert I just go to my raw recipe books or ""Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar.""",4 people found this helpful,1

I'm a healthy vegan with hopes to reduce my body fat percentage as I go to the gym regularly. I got this book in hopes of finding healthier recipies without the hydrogenated replacements and lower carb options. There are awesome recipies in this book but most of them are very high in carbs. Out of 150, I selected 10-15 recipes.
I wish there were photos for each recipe, imagination is not my strongpoint. Furthermore, I wish they had more salad and dressing options. I liked the exercise guide in the back. Great refreshers course for beginners.

If you're looking to lose weight, get healthy, try a vegan diet or incorporate some plant-based fare into your diet, go for Happy Herbivore. This one is good, it's not my favorite book though. The work out portion, while simple and informative, will probably not get any use by me. I'd rank the Happy Herbivore books from best to ""worst"" (though I love them all) this way: Happy Herbivore Everday, Happy Herbivore, Happy Herbivore Light & Lean, and Happy Herbivore Abroad.

Other low- or no-fat cookbooks that I recommend are the ""Prevent and Cure Heart Disease"" and the ""China Study"" cookbooks.

I made the ruby chocolate muffins, which 5 year old Bella pronounced ""Better than Delicious. They're Great-licious!"" The Lentil Joes are also amazing.

I preordered it because I was so excited for it to come out based on our experience with her other cookbooks. We cook out of Lindsay's cookbooks all the time and I never have to worry about my health or weight eating this way. Also, many of her recipes are easy enough that my 10-year-old daughter can make them. (Of course, she loves baking the best! I love that the healthy chocolate chip cookies recipe page is covered with splatters!) This cookbook is as wonderful as the rest, especially if you still have weight to lose. I would also say that they are easy for me to use as is or adapt for my husband's very restricted diet (no egg, dairy, gluten, soy or corn). Some of our favorite recipes from this cookbook are the loaded baked potatoes, caribbean chili (soooo delicious!), chocolate surprise frosting, oven fries, skinny mac and cheese, everyday mushroom gravy, and whole wheat drop biscuits. We still have several recipes we'd like to try, too, because there are so many exciting new ones for us. I also like that she includes a few of her basic/favorite recipes in this cookbook so that you don't have to go opening another cookbook or two during meal prep to get at recipes say for no-chicken broth powder, biscuits, chocolate chip cookies, or gluten-free flour blend. So if you don't own more than one (or the whole series, like I do!) you can still make those foundational recipes.

495,Happy Herbivore Light & Lean: Over 150 Low-Calorie Recipes with Workout Plans for Looking and Feeling Great,1,Representative of a very unhealthy realtionship with food.,Format: Paperback,"There are ""helpful tips"" like putting celery front and center in your fridge, and only eating if you're willing to eat celery. If you ""have"" to eat out, you should start with a salad with plain vinegar or hot sauce for dressing. Almost all of the recipes are for 1 or 2 servings, which is fine if it's a book advertising that but it makes me uncomfortable that it's a bad idea to keep brown rice or lentils cooked in the fridge, I'm supposed to be cooking them 1/4 C at a time. The only soup recipe that actually makes a whole pot was the cabbage soup, which at only 50 calories/cup is okay to stockpile? There are multiple references to healthy fats such as nuts and avocado as ""cheater"" ingredients.
Some of the information is helpful, but I found the overall tone of the book to be very unhealthy. I wouldn't even give it away, I trashed it because I didn't want to spread that kind of self-hate and numbers obsession to my friends.",46 people found this helpful,0

The only soup recipe that actually makes a whole pot was the cabbage soup, which at only 50 calories/cup is okay to stockpile?

I especially liked the icons and nutrition information for each recipe. The reason for only 2 stars is that the recipes don't indicate the amount of time for preparing and cooking the meals. It's especially important to have times when cooking raw beans. Also, the index is not very helpful. I normally select recipes based on an ingredient I have on hand. Much of the index is an alphabetical list of the recipe titles. As an example, try looking up potatoes or rice in the index and you won't find it. Also, who needs a recipe to cook plain oatmeal?

865,Happy Herbivore Light & Lean: Over 150 Low-Calorie Recipes with Workout Plans for Looking and Feeling Great,1,Representative of a very unhealthy realtionship with food.,Format: Paperback,"There are ""helpful tips"" like putting celery front and center in your fridge, and only eating if you're willing to eat celery. If you ""have"" to eat out, you should start with a salad with plain vinegar or hot sauce for dressing. Almost all of the recipes are for 1 or 2 servings, which is fine if it's a book advertising that but it makes me uncomfortable that it's a bad idea to keep brown rice or lentils cooked in the fridge, I'm supposed to be cooking them 1/4 C at a time. The only soup recipe that actually makes a whole pot was the cabbage soup, which at only 50 calories/cup is okay to stockpile? There are multiple references to healthy fats such as nuts and avocado as ""cheater"" ingredients.
Some of the information is helpful, but I found the overall tone of the book to be very unhealthy. I wouldn't even give it away, I trashed it because I didn't want to spread that kind of self-hate and numbers obsession to my friends.",46 people found this helpful,0
