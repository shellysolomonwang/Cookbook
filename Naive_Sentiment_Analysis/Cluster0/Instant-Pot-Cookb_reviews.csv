1,Instant Pot Cookbook: 500 Most Delicious Recipe Collection Anyone Can Cook,5,Buy this cookbook!,Format: Kindle Edition,"I’m a new user of the Instant Pot and after having tried a few online recipes that didn’t turn out well, I though I would opt for a cookbook. This cookbook is great! I’ve made three of the recipes so far and each has been delicious. The choice of recipes is diverse and I’m looking forward to trying more!

The photo is the Chicken and Chickpea Masala which is my favorite from the collection so far!",295 people found this helpful,1
2,Instant Pot Cookbook: 500 Most Delicious Recipe Collection Anyone Can Cook,5,A Great Recipe Book,Format: Kindle Edition,I have found lots of recipes I will enjoy. I don’t have”the” Instant Pot but I have an electric pressure cooker I bought over a year ago and am just now using. This book is perfect for me because I don’t have a “soup” or “rice” button and these recipes list the times and what pressure.,37 people found this helpful,1

These are the six terms the author included with every 500 recipes of this book and the average preparation time of all the recipes included in this book is i think not more than 30 min and the recipes are prepared by a wide range of ingredients. That give me a freedom choose what i want to eat anytime of the day.",214 people found this helpful,1
4,Instant Pot Cookbook: 500 Most Delicious Recipe Collection Anyone Can Cook,4,LOTS OF RECIPES!,,"This cookbook does have a lot of recipes in it but I found many that I would never use, such as goat meat, lamb , octopus etc. I would say I will use about 25% of what it offers—but that’s just me. It wd be great for those who want to try some really different cuisine. It has lots of sauces, Chinese food , breakfast dishes, soups and desserts. It does give directions oninbeach recipe for setting the pot which is very helpful. But there is no extra information about the Instant pot itself or pressure cooking in general. It is strictly a cookbook. The recipes that I have made so far have been good. There is an offer posted on the front of the book for additional 1000 classic recipes u can access online but after several trys I could not bring it up.",12 people found this helpful,1

7,Instant Pot Cookbook: 500 Most Delicious Recipe Collection Anyone Can Cook,5,Simple straightforward reference guide,,"I realize there are a number of facebook groups and webpages out there with Instant Pot recipes. I do use those but sometimes when you want a quick reference guide or you are a beginner looking to just make potatoes this comes in handy. As a beginner getting this cookbook it also opened me to the range of things that you can make in your instant pot. Not something you would immediately realize from the facebook groups as they are posting more complicated or sophisticated recipes.

Very simple book like a cooking manual for the instant pot. But no pictures.",7 people found this helpful,1
8,Instant Pot Cookbook: 500 Most Delicious Recipe Collection Anyone Can Cook,4,"I love the cookbook and almost gave it 5 Stars, ... but!",Format: Kindle Edition,"I love the cookbook and would give it 5 Stars ... but, it is on my Kindle and guess what??? On my first recipe I prepared all the ingredients in advance, but when I was in the middle of an unfamiliar recipe double checking steps, or timing a saute, or making other preparations, my KINDLE suddenly times out and turns off and the recipe disappears? This never happens when I am reading, so I never thought to change the Kindle settings. My fault, but it was disconcerting, especially since I did not have the time during cooking to reset my Kindle's timer.

I do have a question ... why is the printing in the Table of Contents in the Kindle edition so faded and difficult to visually scan rapidly, especially since the rest of the printing in the book is dark and easy to read?",11 people found this helpful,1

Too often cookbooks have odd recipes and odd ingredients many people do not keep on hand such coconut milk, fish oil, etc. There are only a few recipes that have odd ingredients I might have a hard time buying where I live but then I wouldn't make the recipe anyway because it did not appeal to me.

I was expecting more of a traditional cookbook with photos and a traditional format but this is just a simple, text-only, print-on-demand, self-published book. If the content was good then the appearance would not have mattered but I noticed errors right away browsing through the recipes. For example, beef recipes on pages 98 and 99 each call for 10 POUNDS of beef! The cooking time summary at the top of the recipes doesn't always match the time listed in the detailed descriptions. In short, this content has not passed the scrutiny of an editor as a legitimately published cookbook would have. I'm giving this cookbook two stars because it is (just barely) as described on the product page but the errors I noticed through quickly browsing the book make me not trust the content so I will be returning this item.

I could not believe why there were so many 5-star reviews for this cookbook so I ran the reviews through ReviewMeta and FakeSpot and they both failed.

Get to know your pot. Ours takes 10-15 minutes to get pressure, so you have to factor that into every recipe - and some of them have you pressure cooking more than once per meal.

Also - after trying a few, we have needed to tweak times/ingredients/etc to make them work better.

555,Instant Pot Cookbook: 500 Most Delicious Recipe Collection Anyone Can Cook,1,Don’t buy it!,Format: Kindle Edition,"Save your money. I wish I had.

This book offers vague directions and amounts, and the calorie counts are WAY off! For example, a recipe for stuffed chicken breasts that serves 2 calls for:
2 chicken breasts—— It does not say chicken breast halves, but chicken breasts.
1 piece of ham, cut in half and cooked—-How large is this piece of ham?
6 asparagus spears—-Well, okay, but they might be dwarfed by the 2 chicken breasts.
4 mozzarella cheese slices—-How large?
16 bacon strips—Really? You wrap each chicken breast in 8 strips of bacon.
This comes in, according to the writer, at 270 calories per serving. Unless I have miscalculated, you have more calories than that in just the bacon!

The recipe for beef and broccoli that serves 4 calls for 3 lbs. of beef chuck roast. But good news, it is only 338 calories per serving. Just this much beef is about 1870 calories, but 338 x 4 = 1352. How can that be? And that does not include the other ingredients.

The recipe for chicken and rice calls for 3 chicken quarters, cut in small pieces. Is it the leg quarter or the breast quarter? Do you just chop it skin, bones, and all? The rice is listed in the marinade ingredients. It serves 2 and comes in at 200 calories per serving. 1 1/2 cups raw rice alone is about 1100 calories.

- page 78, Chicken and Rice. This recipe states ""35 minutes cooking time"". Yet, the individual cooking times add up to 12 minutes. Where did the other 23 minutes of cooking time go? The last sentence of the recipe states ""Add the chicken on the plates with to rice, and serve."" Did anyone bother to proof-read this cookbook? Hint: spell-check is not an adequate proof-reader.
- page 92, Chicken and Noodles. After cooking the chicken, onion, garlic, celery, carrots, stock, blah, blah, blah, the recipe says to ""release the pressure naturally"", uncover the pot, add 1 pound of egg noodles, cornstarch/water mix, peas, lemon juice, parsley, salt and pepper, stir and serve.

It looks to me that some recipes are pulled from the internet and simplified, and in doing so mistakes have been put into publication. For example, his recipe for Ham and White Bean Soup is VERY similar to the one on the Delicious Meets Healthy website, yet where DMH calls for beans soaked for 1 hour using the Quick Soak Method (which it explains), this cookbook calls for ""white beans soaked for 1 hour and drained"". These are NOT interchangeable instructions. DMH instructions finish with ""Let NPR for 10 minutes, and then QR until all the pressure is out..."" The recipe from this cookbook says, ""Release the pressure for 10 minutes, uncover the Instant Pot...."" It is very unclear on any of the recipes if you are to use NPR or QR.

I DO NOT recommend and will be returning this cookbook and encouraging my daughter to do the same with the one I purchased for her.",21 people found this helpful,0
642,Instant Pot Cookbook: 500 Most Delicious Recipe Collection Anyone Can Cook,1,This book is riddled with errors and is one of the worst presented books I have seen in my life,Format: Kindle Edition,"Shoddily written, Full of Errors, Dead link on the free gift.

This book is riddled with errors and is one of the worst presented books I have seen in my life.

First off, The cover of the book contains NO correct sentences. The ""paragraph"" on the back is two sentence fragments.
""Only the most flavorful, Test Kitchen & foolproof recipes collection. Cookbook that will make your life easier!""

The title on the spine of the book is different than the title on the front cover. Also the image on the cover is an instant pot rather shoddily Photoshopped into a stock photo.

The ""Free Gift"" of 1000 extra recipes is a link to a blank wordpress website, which has ""hello world"" as the only post.",6 people found this helpful,0
643,Instant Pot Cookbook: 500 Most Delicious Recipe Collection Anyone Can Cook,1,Buy something else!,,"I just received an Instant Pot and this cookbook as a gift and I was so excited to try them both out until I tried to make sense of one of the recipes. The instructions say: cook on “manual setting”. There is no manual setting on the Instant Pot. Brand new to all of this I decided to see if the cookbook has an informative intro that would offer some tips or explanation. No. The intro really offers no helpful information at all and is littered with typos, grammatical errors, and formatting mistakes. I read some of the other poor reviews just now and apparently there are serious errors in the recipes too. This cookbook is a bust. Pick something else!",4 people found this helpful,0
644,Instant Pot Cookbook: 500 Most Delicious Recipe Collection Anyone Can Cook,2,This book needs a new version published after it has been properly edited for errors.,Format: Paperback,"It appears an editor was not utilized before publishing this book. I’m still trying to figure out how to chop red wine, how 10 lbs of beef can make a dish that serves four, and how to make Colombian chicken in a pressure cooking device that utilizes steam for cooking when the recipe doesn’t include any liquid. Those kinds of gross content errors erode the faith I can have in any of the recipes in this book. The concept is good, and the recipes are interesting, but I cannot risk making any of them without first checking each one carefully to make sure the quantities or measurements are within an expected range. Who has time for that?!?! I have other cookbooks that are in the same price range but don’t have the gross errors in them. This one gathers dust.",,0
