1,21 Pounds in 21 Days: The Martha's Vineyard Diet Detox,5,A Great fantastic book!,Format: Paperback,"The best detailed book and diet. I started in mid-September and I lost 50 pounds in two months byThanksgiving! I am not exaggerating or lying, I have the pictures to prove it. I went at two weeks segments while following it. When I started, which I will admit, like any other diet, was difficult because you are changing your habits and following a curtailed diet and formula. You just have to be easy on yourself. By the next morning I lost two pounds. I made it nine days and lost 17 pounds! Then went off for a couple of days but still followed the book and went back on the diet, going back and forth losing weight at an even clip. The book explains everything before, during and after, with the author's story, who discovered and went through the exact same thing as you will or do. By Christmas I lost 60 pounds! That's three months. I would go off the diet when there was an event, like Thanksgiving,Christmas and New Year then go back and forth around the events. The purpose for any diet was for my daughter's wedding that coming June. I wanted to be slimmer, especially since pictures would be taken. By June I lost 80 pounds. I did not rush or worry about any crash to lose the weight, I took my time and surprisingly lost the weight rapidly. I got the hang of it and lost the most weight. It is amazing what your own body does when it gets a little help. The first thing you will notice, other than losing pounds, is ""you are not hungry"" once you get past the inital stage of the diet. Sleeping well and the natural energy will happen almost instant. Just remember, your mind will trick you into giving up and getting you to think this is for you, that is all of the junk luggage and sugar your body is holding. Again a great book and eating change.",39 people found this helpful,1
2,21 Pounds in 21 Days: The Martha's Vineyard Diet Detox,4,"If it were easy, everyone would do it.",Format: Mass Market Paperback,"Great detox but best if you read the book first. While I am doing it for the 3rd time, each time I've done it I have had to read the book again. I agree with some of the reviews that it talks a lot about the testimony of others but for me that is paramount in making a connection for why I'm doing it. I find the testimonials to be helpful additionally because you learn that people approach it differently so when I do my rendition (though I try to do it as prescribed), I know it is okay. It helps me make it through.

The biggest tip I have is to read the book first, before actually doing the detox. It helps solidify your resolve during those times, and it will happen, where you want to give up. If you make it through your program (whether 7, 14 or 21 days) you will feel and look great and be more apt to eat more healthy going forward.",19 people found this helpful,1

5,21 Pounds in 21 Days: The Martha's Vineyard Diet Detox,5,Feel your best!,Format: Hardcover,"I did this cleanse because a friend of mine recommended it and it is one of the best things I've ever done for my body. I did it for 15 days, and yes, I lost 15lbs, but more importantly than the weight I lost my body felt the best it has possibly ever felt.

I've read some of the other reviews, people said it was disgusting or they were hungry all the time, and I should say that I did not follow the regimen to the letter. I bought Naked Juice instead of Martha's Vineyard's juices, I used supplements that I liked, I did a Yogic intestinal wash (Laghoo shankhaprakshalana) instead of enemas, I added a pinch of salt to soups I made that were too bitter, and I ate soups at restaurants when I went out with friends. I think in order to keep from failing you have to allow yourself some wiggle room. The end result was amazing ... my friends all said my skin was glowing, my mood improved, my energy level increased, I wanted to exercise, and I felt fantastic in my body. And when I did start eating again, everything tasted SOOO GOOD! I enjoyed food on a level I never knew was possible.

If I'd followed the cleanse exactly my results could only have been better, but the way I followed it I didn't get hungry, I didn't feel deprived, it wasn't disgusting, and I still got all the benefits. I highly recommend this program to anyone wanting to improve their health, and the bonus is you'll get an improved relationship with your body and with food.",361 people found this helpful,1

9,21 Pounds in 21 Days: The Martha's Vineyard Diet Detox,5,review updated in 2015,Format: Mass Market Paperback,"I was always the chubby kid.. then the obese teen. As a teen I found my love, martial arts, and transformed into an athlete. After the serious injury, the misdiagnosis with delayed treatments then the life-threatening complications and myriads of cascading medical events virtually stripping my ability to participate in most common daily activities for more than seconds and minutes at a time, it is no wonder after 2 decades I find myself once again overweight, this time as ""morbidly obese.""

A couple years ago, determined to take control of my health, I literally purged my home of anything containing high fructose corn syrup, artificial colors, artificial sweeteners, hormones, anti-biotics, brominated vegetable oil and anything else I deem as ""over-processed chemicalized sludge"".

My weight stabilized then another medical saga left me despondent, drifting through life grazing on enough fare from the traditional Standard American Diet (very SAD) I gained yet more weight til I was ""morbidly obese"".

Returning to my strict adherence to avoiding the ingredients which causes me to refer to over-processed goods as ""chemicalized sludge"", I again stabilized my weight. Figuring out hormonal body types helped lead me to enhanced supplementation- I lost an amazing 5.4% in just 2 weeks! ! Wow!

Trying to boost my game, afterall I still cannot ""workout"" in the traditional sense, a friend led me to this book. Wow! So much I have come to know to be true is packed into a simple easy to follow manual.

Whether you want to lose 21 pounds in 21 days or you need to lose 21% or in my case intend to lose over 100 pounds, get this book. It can literally help you empower yourself to save your life.

2015 Update - okay, so shortly after posting my previous review I had several major setbacks, both physically and then mentally. I fell off the horse after losing about 40 pounds. If I can do it while physically disabled, someone who can seriously work out may have a better chance. I'm back on track now, almost 3 years later. Since then I've learned the truth about SYNTHETIC vitamins such as FOLIC ACID and the truth of REAL vitamins such as FOLATE and WHY it's such a huge importance particularly with over 60% of us having some form of the MTHFR genetic mutations (anyone with a personal or family history of diabetes, hypertension, cancer, neural tube defects, luekemia, ms, liver disease, cardiac issues, birth defects, autism, depression, chronic fatigue, anxiety or about any other issue, consider getting tested at a site like 23andme then upload the raw data to a site like Genetic Genie for REAL info on what you need to do for your health.

So.. I'm back to REAL foods, those that are FREE of ""enriched"" synthetic vitamins and nutrients. I'm back on track.. and 20 pounds just melted away seemingly overnight (2 months). As long as I'm good about staying on track I loose weight. .. now the problem is staying on track.",6 people found this helpful,1
10,21 Pounds in 21 Days: The Martha's Vineyard Diet Detox,5,Finally Loosing That Weight!,Format: Mass Market Paperback,"It's been a while since I left a review, however I have to now. I'm 55 and for the past 5 years have had a hard time loosing weight [25 pounds]. I thought about Detoxing and didn't know to much on how or what to do. I read the book first before doing anything...because I really wanted it to work. The testimonies are very valuable of successful 21 day detoxing with a wide range of age groups. We decided to do it [hubby and me] This is our 8th day. The first 2 days were uncomfortable .. only because of habits that we have... other then that we were not hungry. We decided to weight ourselves on the 7th day. My hubby lost an amazing 14 pounds and I lost 13 pounds... we are on our way... Yeehaw!

I haven't used a juicer... only a high power blender. I also bought most of the products from SwansonVitamins.com
[Amazon was higher priced] The Garden Greens products such as Acai Splash Energizing Drink, the Essential Greens are the best and taste good. Then added veggies or berries. And very important! I set the Timer every 2 hours for another Greens Drink.

25,21 Pounds in 21 Days: The Martha's Vineyard Diet Detox,5,Lots of wisdom in this cleanse,Format: Hardcover,"I am ever grateful to Roni DeLuz for her wisdom, expertise and generosity of spirit. I am on the 20th day of the cleanse, and am extremely pleased that I stumbled across her work.

I have discovered that I do, in fact, have willpower. I thought it had faded with my youth. I have tried for seven years to lose the weight I gained after two children, and I finally did it. I am down 15 pounds, and feel great. I not only lost weight, but also learned a lot in the process about my health and well being.

The cleanse was a good challenge for me. It was difficult at times, and I contemplated quitting on several occasions, but am so glad I have stuck with it. I am an extremely busy person, I teach full time, have 3 school age kids, and have a husband who works full time as well. I found that I had a lot of energy the first four days, and then crashed on days five and six. They were tough. But I muscled my way through. I did have vegan protein shakes on about one third of the days; they helped me feel better on my low days. I also took vegan DHA/EPA and GABA to keep my mood up throughout the cleanse. I did invest in the colonics, and did the coffee enemas, skin brushing, and Epsom salt baths. I had cravings at times, they were intense at first, and then came and went throughout the cleanse. Most of the time they were not too bad.

I bought my products at GNC/Whole Foods/my local coop. On one of the previous Amazon reviews, some kind soul offered a link to a Google group where I found a good shopping list. I suggest using the updated daily schedule from Dr. Roni's website. I did not order any products from her website, so was very grateful when she took the time to email me back with the answer to a question I had.

I highly recommend the book if you are serious about completing an effective cleanse. The poor reviews of this book were written by people who did not try the cleanse, and could not get past the fact that the book could have used some further editing.",11 people found this helpful,1

29,21 Pounds in 21 Days: The Martha's Vineyard Diet Detox,4,you can't give a bad review if you didn't try it!!!,Format: Hardcover,"I bought the book first & once I was mentally ready I bought the plan from Ebay (much cheaper than from the actual site.) I stuck with it for 21 days & I lost 15 lb. It has been 1 month, today, since my 21st day & I am maintaining & I have lost more on my own. This book/plan altered my lifestyle. I cleansed my body, mind, closet, fridge & pantry. I am a procrastinator too - go figure.

My friend just finished & lost 16 lb. If you are ready you will succeed. I didn't do any enemas, colonics, etc. I did what I could afford & had time for. I treated myself w/something ea week. I did the detox bath (very inexpensive) & I had 2 massages. I didn't juice anything either. I just drank what I bought..I did make the pureed soups during week two. I just boiled and used my food processor.

I also think the book is pretty straight forward - meaning the author knows that most people can not follow nor afford the plan like those people that actually go to Martha's Vineyard Detox Center & have all of the resources provided to them. Maybe going to MVineyard would have helped me lose the extra 6 lbs??? Who cares, I lost 15 and I got past the plateau.

321,21 Pounds in 21 Days: The Martha's Vineyard Diet Detox,3,"This book is truly awful, but THE PLAN WORKS!",Format: Hardcover,"I'm on DAY 6 and I've lost 8.5 pounds!

Having said that, let me add that my success so far has been largely due to my own ingenuity and prior knowledge of the many poorly presented concepts this plan adheres to.

Reading this book, I was amazed at the general negative undertone throughout, especially when combined with the insistently surprising references by both authors to their personal religion and faith. While both authors describe in detail their negative health influences over the years (the book reads like one bad health crisis after another), when it came to the positive elements of their recoveries from these health issues, not much was said. I noticed many opportunities where the authors could have pumped up their dialogue with lively positive feedback to empower their reader, yet did not. It would seem to me, if you want to inspire people to drastically change their habits, playing up the positive would be crucial. By the time I got to the ""story"" about sisters who died after binging on beer and bar food because they did not come off their 21 day cleanse as prescribed, I was done with the bad vibe this book gives off and was left with the distinct feeling if I ever met the authors in person they'd have dark clouds hovering over their heads.

As well as the book being a downer to read, the majority of the program is presented in a very secretive way. Detailed info on supplements, processes and assured recipes are nearly non-existent (the products can be found on an accompanying website, though what you can expect to get in the detox kits sold here is also vague). Who writes a book to help people, then snatches away all the ""help"" at the last minute? There's that dark cloud again. Clearly the focus for the authors was on making a buck. Offering up true, accessible healing to their readers seems to be secondary, if at all.

Still, once you figure out where to find the program necessities, the diet does work and I couldn't love the results more. Here's the scoop:

The drink mixes and ""cleansing herbs"" kit are all from a company called Garden Greens. You can find their products by googling ""Vegesplash"", ""Essential Greens"" and ""Inner Cleanse"". You can also double check this info on the MV Detox Diet website by clicking ""Buy Detox Products"" and thoroughly reading all the info and links in the kit descriptions. Clicking many of the links highlighted in blue will bring up ingredient and nutrition info for the products offered.

All of the other products listed in the book for the program are easy to find at Whole Foods or Super Supplements. If you tell the store clerk what you are using the item for they can guide you to the right one.

I couldn't find the Garden Greens products locally and chose a different brand (with the help of the clerk at Super Supplements) based on the somewhat vague guidelines given by the author. So far, I feel great and the program works as outlined with these products too!

Many of the concepts here are based on principles found in the raw food movement. If this book leaves you thinking, ""ok, but why?"", check out the books by Natalia Rose. She empowers her readers with an incredible amount of inspiring knowledge, and her vibrant lust for life and good food is immediately contagious. Her book titled, ""Raw Food Life Force Energy"" is particularly upbeat, fun and packed with info.

Electrolytes such as Potassium and Sodium were completely depleted during the detox through the use of distilled water, enemas, colonics and total lack of nutrition.

326,21 Pounds in 21 Days: The Martha's Vineyard Diet Detox,1,Lets get serious,Format: Hardcover,"Diets come and go. We had the adkins diet in the early 2000's which entailed cutting out carbs. Eventually this turned into low carb diets and then America shifted to low fat. This just sounds rediculous. Anybody can lose weight by just eating correctly and eating at the right times. Typically, people eat their heaviest meal in the evening which is when we are winding down. If one wants to increase their metabolism which will burn through your food and keep you fit. Your best option is to eat 5 small meals/snacks a day. Say you are normally eating 1500 calories per day. Many will argue well if I eat 5 meals a day I am eating more and getting fat or gaining weight. Not so! In fact if you eat 5 300 calorie meals you are eating the same amount of food just several different times. The 21 day diet is inefficient and you will gain the weight back immediately when you get off of it or switch to whole foods.

After reading the book I realized that someone was trying to hide the fact that this diet is extremely difficult if not imposible to do on your own. The book's author runs a detox center, where, if you want to spend thousands of dollars you will have someone waiting on you hand and foot while you do the diet. That is about the only way you are going to do the diet. The supplements taste terrible and are very expensive. The book never talks about that of course. In fact I believe the author of the book tried to hide many facts about the diet deep inside the book or left them out completely. So, be careful, it's not what it seems.

330,21 Pounds in 21 Days: The Martha's Vineyard Diet Detox,1,Do your own research and use common sense,Format: Hardcover,"I found myself flipping rapidly through the pages and pages of testimonials waiting for something really beneficial. I was disappointed, but kept reading because after all the hype I'd heard about this book, I thought it was going to be something helpful. Instead, it's merely repetition of ""information"" that could have been surmised in two pages. DeLuz does go to great lengths to give the pros and cons of other diets, mainly siting her verdict that they're too restrictive or complicated for people to implement. Yet, even here in other reviews, this plan is defended with things like, if you want results, you have to stick with it. DUH! I think that is the plain common sense advice for what it takes for anything to work.

This book is extremely lacking in recipes. Sources for all the toxins claims could have been organized better. The recipes should have been in the front, or at least somewhere near the claims. Jack LaLane already has a great juicer and juice program; go with his deal. It's cheaper, easier to follow, his books are about a page and a half of why to do it and then bam, bam, bam, he gives you a bunch of recipes and their nutritional breakdown. That and he's living long-term evidence.

Earlier this year I'd really made a mind set change about my health, and wanted as much information as possible to help me stick with the changes. I didn't want a pill or whatever; I wanted to change my habits.

After listening to Robin Quivers talk about her lack of success sticking with healthy eating, and subsequently gaining back all her weight following the cleanses that she did, I thought this book would be helpful for me. I was disappointed mostly by the lack of references to back up Ms. DeLuz's claims. Mainly it's many referrals to [...] You go there and can get a 21-day ""special"" for ONLY $199...HMMM...I was disappointed that, on page 132, she teeters on a version of the Urban Legend of John Wayne's 40 pounds (or 45 or 50, depending on which online site you're on, plus Elvis' 60 pounds of impacted fecal matter at death - check out Snopes.com on that - John Wayne never had an autopsy. He'd already had several surgeries and died of cancer, there was no need, nor is it ever documented in the bazillion ""claims"" online) where she claims, ""Many people have between ten and twenty-five pounds of toxic fecoid matter just sitting in their colon!"" Well, that's where I closed the book. And not just because ""fecoid"" is not a real word. Simply call a gastroenterologist and ask how much pain a person would be in, rectal bleeding would be occurring, and what would be the symptoms of this impacted fecal matter.

I'm also disturbed by the vagueness on page 32 (where there actually is a reference to one bestselling author) about, ""sick soil produces sick crops."" I'm amazed that anyone wouldn't remember those films from grade school talking about sick soil produces NO crops. Basic botany dictates that vegetation can only thrive if there's a healthy balance of minerals and proper soil conditions. And it seems like too much of a rumor with the, ""you have to eat between fifteen and twenty cups of spinach,"" to get the same nutrition as a cup of spinach grown in 1950...when they were using paraquat and DDT????? Come ON!!

With that said, I do believe much of what DeLuz WANTS to do is good. It's just sorely lacking in organization, references, and the science behind her claims. If you are completely ignorant about even the most basic nutritional facts, this may help you. (You can get the definition of ""germ"" and ""fat"" on page 214 of the glossary, for example.) There's one tiny blurb about diabetes, which she should have expounded on, and the dangers of sugar, and what makes sugar, and what sugar does, as far as being one of the main toxic dangers in our society. She has another tiny blurb about sugar on page 37.
